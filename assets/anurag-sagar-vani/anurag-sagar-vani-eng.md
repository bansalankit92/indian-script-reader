A Few Words

This worldly existence (sansar) before Kabir sahib
wrongly worshipped Kal as Param Purush. They lived in
the world of mind. Even the so-called saints and Prophets
of today are unaware about the secrets of devotion to
Parampurush. Therefore, they (Pirs, Paegambars, Rishis,
and Munis) are misguiding their followers, unknowingly.
Everyone freely quotes from the Kabir Vani, but in
actuality, they are only engaged in worship of Kal Purush.
Some of them simply speak about Satyalok, but they
neither actually have the true Naam nor did anyone of
them attain Satyalok. They are all only subservient to the
mind (Mann), therefore they are entangled in only Sargun
and Nirgun Bhaktis. The mind is very vicious, many
famous Gurus and Seekers were trapped, in its web. In
reality, through such inept Gurus and Seekers, the
Jivatmas (souls) are disillusioned; therefore, the whole
world is engaged in the business of false Naam:
Santo Yaha Mann Hai Bada Jalim||Mann Karan Ki Inki
Chaya,
Tehi Chaya Mey Atkey|Nirgun Sargun Mann Ki Baji,
Khare Sayane Bhatke||Man Hi Chaudah Lok Banaya,
Panch Tatva Gun Kinhe|Tin Lok Jewan Vash Kinhe,
Pare Na Kahu Chinhe||Jo Kou Kahe Hum Mann Ko
Mara,
Jakey Rup Na Rekha|Chin Chin Men Kitne Rang Badale,
Je Sapanehu Na Dekha||Rasatal Yekesh Brahmanda,
Sab Par Adal Chalave|Shat Ras Mey Bhogi Mann Raja,
So Kaise Ko Pavey|| Sabke Upar Naam Nirakshar,
Tahan Le Mann Ko Rakhey|Tab Mann Ki Gathi Jani
Parey,
Yah Satya Kabir Muk Bhakhey|


Anuragsagar Vani 6

SATGURU RANJADIWALE SAYS:
With a very Scientic approach, our path has brought
renaissance in the field of devotion. First five distinct
aspects are enunciated for the benefit of humanity. * This
universe is the domain of Kalpurush. Kal Niranjan’s
kingdom is in the three lokas. He is referred by the Vedas
and Shastras as Nirakar, Nirankar, Niranjan, and
ParBrahmas etc. All Gann, Gandharvas, Sidhdas,
Sadhakas, Rishi- Munis, Pirs, and Paegambars have
attained upto this level. *Amarlok cannot be attained with
one’s own effort. It is possible only with the grace and
benediction of a real living Satguru. *The ‘SaarNaam’, is
not to be found in 52 Varnaksharas (Hindi Alphabets) and
it cannot be either written, read or pronounced in the
worldly manners.* The ‘Naam’ as said above is an art that
the Poorna Satguru (true master) possesses, with which
the soul is awakened and separated from the mind. This
process of awakening the soul and being made aware of
its own infinite power is called ‘Naamdan’. This ‘Naam’
is imparted to the soul and not to the physical body of the
human beings. * Beyond the fourteen lokas of the
kalpurush, there is only vacuum – nothingness -
Mahashunya Lok comprising of the Achintyalok,
Sohanglok, Mulsuratilok, Ankurlok, Ichalok, Vanilok, and
Sahajlok. During the mahaparalaya all lokas upto the
Sahajlok are destroyed.
Sahaj Purush Tak Jetak Bhakha,Yah Rachana Paraley Te
Rakha| |
Age Achay Lok Hey Bhai, Adi Purush Yaha Ap Rahai | |
Amardham is the world of Parampurush, which is beyond
Sahajlok. It is always safe and free from Mahapralaya.
Kabir Sahib arrived on this earth for the welfare of souls,
to help them to attain Amarlok.

## 1. SATGURU – VANDANA

Pratham Vedo Satguru Charan,
Jin Agam Gamya Lakhaiya |
Gyandip Prakash Kari,
Pat Khol Darash Dikhaiya | |
Jihi Karane Sidhya Pache,
So Guru Krupa-Te Paiya |
Akah Murti Amiya Surti,
Tahi Jaye Samaiya | |
Firstly, pay obeisance to the holy feet of Satguru who in
a natural and effortless way has shown you the glimpse of
the Amarlok, which is otherwise unattainable with one’s
own efforts. The Satguru has banished the darkness of
ignorance and darkness associated with it by lighting a
lamp of wisdom within the soul. Sahib, who could not be
reached or realized by all the great Sidhdas and Prophets
during their lifetime, has granted us, and by his grace
helped the souls to blend with the nectar (Amrut) of
Satyalok.

Aagun Merey Bapji, Baksh Gareeb Nivaj.
Jo Main Poot Kapoot Hoon, Tohi Pita Ki Laj.
_—_ Sahibji
O Satguru! O Param Purush! Pardon my vices. Though
I am your foolish son, yet you should uphold the
dignity of being a father. Kindly don’t feel offended
and pardon me far all my wrong doings.
Surti Karo Mum Sayiyan, Hum Hain Bhavjal Mahin.
Aaphe Hum Bah Jayen Ge, Jo Nahin Pakro Bahin.
_—_ Sahibji
O Satguru! Keep your kind attention on us. We are
entangled in the worldly mayaic mesh. We will be
drifting away in this huge worldly ocean if you don’t
support us.

## 2. TRUE LOVER OF THE WORD

### 2 Shabd ke Premi

```
Koi Bujhai Jann Johari,
Jo Shabd Ki Parakh Karey|
Chitlay Sunahin Sikhavano,
Hithlay Ke Hirday Dharey||
Tam Moh Mo Sam Gyan Ravi,
Jab Pragat Ho Tab Sujayi|
Kahat Ho Mey Shabd Sancha,
Sant Koi Bujai||
Like a jeweler who can assess the value of the gold,
word of sahib propounds the essential truth of
Parampurush. Sahibji says that one should attentively
listen and understand his words and accepts the same as
the benefactor in one’s heart.When the intense sun of
knowledge of Sahibji manifests, only then the darkness of
ignorance can be, distinguished. He utters the true words
that only a true Sant can understand.
Koi Ek Sant Sujan, Jo Mam Sabd Bicharai|
Pavey Pad Nirvan, Basat Anurag Jasu Ur||
Only those, whose heart is, filled with love, can attain
salvation and it is only he, who is an intelligent saint.
Dharmadas enquires:
Hey Satguru Binvo Kar Jori|
Sanshay Prabhu Ek Meto Morey||
Jakey Chit Anurag Samana|
Tako Kaho Kavan Sahidana||
Anuragi Kaise Lakhi Parayi|
Bin Anurag Jiv Nahi Tarai||
So Anurag Prabhu Mohi Batao|
Dei Drushtant Bhaley Samajhao||
Dharmadasji with folded hands prays to Kabir Sahib to
graciously clear his doubt, whether without love, the
Jivatma can attain salvation; Dharmadasji requests Sahibji
to tell him the way to recognise a true lover.

Magan Hoy Vyadh Dhig Avey||
Chit Kachu Shunk Na Avey|
Deth Sish So Nahi Darahi||
Suni-Suni Nad Sis Tin Dinha|
Aise Anuragi Ko Chihna||
Sahibji says that the sign of a true lover is very
endearing. He says that the true lover is like a muskdeer
that gets enchanted with the sound of a flute and runs
towards the hunter, mesmerized with the notes of the flute,
fearless of the fact that, the hunter would kill him.
Listening to the notes of the flute the muskdeer simply
offers his neck and loses his life to the hunter. True lovers
are very much like this proverbial muskdeer.
Jarat Nari Jyo Mrut Pati Sanga|
Tan Ko Jarat Na Morat Anga||
Taje Sugruh Dhan Dham Suheli|

Bahu Sampati Tumare Ghar Ahai,
Palat Chalhu-Gruh Sab As Kahai||
Takey Chitt Kachu Vyapey Nahi,
Priya Anurag Basey Hiy _–_ Mahi||
Sahibji further says that true lovers can also be likened to
the satis, who burn themselves to death on the funeral
pyres of their dead husbands. Such satis did not move or
stir even one bit, even when their bodied caught fire.
These satis used to sacrifice everything to join their
husband’s souls. People used to tempt such satis with the
love of spring by saying that their children would die
without them or would say that her house would be


Anuragsagar Vani 10
foresaken without her. People would even dissuade the
satis by saying that, she still has a lot of wealth that she
can enjoy. In spite of all these temptations the sati for the
love of her husband, would still climb on the funeral pyre
of her dead husband and give up her life.
Tehi Bahut Samujhawate|
Nahi Nari Samajat So Dhani ||
Nahi Kam Hai Dhan Dham Se |
Kachu Mohi To Aisi Bani ||
Jag Jivana Din Chari Hey |
Kahi Nahi Sathi Anth Ko ||
Yah Samujhi Dekho Sakhi,
Tatey Gaho Pad Kant Ko ||
This is the way, in which a sati does not yield to the
dissuading and tempting relatives and instead says that,
there is no meaning in her life, even with all the wealth
and progeny, in the absence of her husband. She says that
she is also nearing death every day and she has no partner
who will make the reminder of her life happy, worthwhile,
and clinging to the feet of her dead husband and in the
bereavement lays down her life.
Sunn Dharma Anurag Ki Bani |
Tum Tat Dekhi Kahey Hitt Jani ||

11 Sahib Bandgi
Sahib says to Dharmadas that for his benefit he has
told him the signs of true lover’s soul. Now he should
identify the true essence of love and forgetting his ego
about his caste and family background he must
contemplate and meditate in the ’Naam’, that sahibji has
bestowed on him. Sahibji cautions Dharmadas that he
should banish all his love and attachment with his son and
wife. He must remember that, this worldly life is only a
dream and that he should know that his life is very short
and in the end he will have no one to help him. He says
that his wife, whom he loved more than his parents and
would even sacrifice his life for her, would not be of any
use in the last moments of his life. She would weep, but
only with selfish interest in her mind and she would
immediately lean towards her parental abode. Sahibji
further tells Dharmadas that one’s affection for family and
wealth is only a dream. Stay true to the Satya Naam and
this is what Sahibji intends Dharmadas to imbibe in his
heart, since one’s wife who is the dearest, would not stay
by him on his death.

Adi Purush Kirpa Karau, Sabb Avgun Chhut Jahin.
Sadh Hoan Lachchhan Milain, Charan Kamal Ki
Chhahin. _—_ Charan Dass ji
O’ Satguru! You are Adi Purush (beginingless). Pray bless
me so that I may become free from vices and may develop
saintly virtues that may enable me to sit beside your holy
feet.

## 3 True saviour at one’s time of death................

Aisa Koi Na Dikhey Bhai |
Anth Hu Yum So Lei Chudai||
Ahai Ek So Kaho Bakhani |
Jehi Anurag Hoy So Mani ||
Satguru Ahi Chudavanhara |
Nishchay Manu Kaha Humara ||
Kal Hi Jit Hans Ley Jahi |
Avichal Desh Purush Jahan Ahi ||
Jaha Jay Sukh Hoy Apara |
Bahuri Na Avey Yahi Sansara ||
Kabir Sahib says that there is no one in this mortal
world who can save the soul from the hands of Kalpurush
after one’s death. Sahibji says that we should have faith in
Satguru alone who will in the end, as a true savior, save
the soul from the hands of Kalpurush by overcoming the
power of Kalpurush. He will carry the soul to the
imperishable Satlok, where in resides the immortal
Parampurush. This is where the soul attains boundless
bliss and will never return to the miseries of this worldly
existence (Sansar).

Tum To Samarth Sayiyan, Drudh Ker Pakro Bahin.
Drudhi Lai Pahunchayiyo, Jani Chhodo Mug Mahin.
O’Satguru! You have full power and
competence. I pray to you to hold my arm tightly and
take me to your Amar Lok. Pray don’t leave me
midway.


13 Sahib Bandgi

## 4 He is sadhu who confronts death...................

```
MRUTAK HOY SO SADHU.
```
Vishvas Kar Mam Bachan Ko, Chad Sat Ki Rah Ho|
Jyo Surma Ran Mey Dhase, Fir Pache Chitvat Nahi Ho||
Sati Shura Bhav Nirkhi Ke, Satya Ko Mag Dhariye|
Mrutak Dasa Vichar Gurugam,Kal Kasht Nivariye||
Sahibji says that one should have faith in what he says
and he must embarks on the path of truth like a warrior,
once steped into the battle field, never looks back. Sahibji
says one should set on the path of truth with firm
determination and with immense faith and love for one’s
Satguru. He must learn to die while living and escape
from the miseries that will be meted out by the Kalpurush.
Koi Sura Jiv, Jo Aisi Karani Karey||
Tahi Milaigo Piv, Kahahin Kabir Bichar Kai||
Sahib further says that one, who sets on the path of
love for one’s Guru, never bothers or fears, he will be no
less than a warrior, and he will definitely meet his lover in
the form of Sahibji.
DHARMADASJI ENQUIRES:
Mrutak Bhav Prabhu Kaho Samujhai|
Jatey Mann Ki Tapan Bujhai||
Kehi Vidhi Mirtak Hoy Sajivan|
Kaho Viloy Nath Amrut Dhan||
What is the secret of death and kindly explain to satisfy
my genuine query. How one experiences death while
living and taste the nectar (AMRUT).
Sahibji replies
Dharmadas Yah Kattin Kahani|
Guru Naam Te Koi Birale Jani||
Mrutak Hoy Ke Khojahu Santa|
Shabd Bichar Gahain Mag Antha||
Jaise Bhrung Kit Ke Pasa|
Kit Hi Gahi Sur Gami Parkasa||
Pankhghat Kar Mahi Tihi Dare|


Anuragsagar Vani 14
Bhrungi Shabd Kit Jo Dhare||
Tab Laigo Bhrungi Nib Geha|
Swas Dei Kinhe Nij Deha||
Bhrungi Shabd Kit Jo Mana|

Tanman Rahit Shabd Hit Maney||
Bhrungi Shabd Kit Na Gahahi|
To Puni Kit Asare Rahahi||
Dharmadas Yah Kit Ko Bheva|
Yahi Mati Shishya Gahe Gurudeva||
Sahib says to Dharmadas that this is a difficult question
only with the grace of the Satguru and love for him; some
rare people have unraveled this mystery by meditating on
the shabd (Soundless Sound). With the help of this Naam
they have traversed the inner path and while living,
experienced a death like state, and uncovered the truth of
Amarlok. Just as bumblebee, (Bhrunga) sounds it’s
vibration into another larve and transforms the insects into
Bhrunga’s own shape and form, convert it into another
Bhrunga. Any insect that moulds itself to the vibration of
the bhrunga willingly loses its own inept state and form
and completely transforms itself into another Bhrunga.
Only a rare insect that attunes itself to the vibration of the
Bhrunga, transforms. Other insects who are not
responsive enough, will attune themselves to the vibration
of the Bhrunga at the second or third attempt, however
those insects who have failed to attune to this vibration
remain as they are and can never become another
Bhrunga. Similarly, Sahib tells Dharmadas that a Satguru
transforms and transmutes his disciples like his own state
of spiritual refinement, those surrenders to the him and
attunes to the Satguru’s word.


15 Sahib Bandgi
Bhrunga Matt Drudh Ke Gahe To|Karo Nij Sam Tohin Ho||
Dutiya Bhav Na Chitt Vyape| So Lahai Jiv Mohi Ho||
Guru Shabd Nishchay Satya Mane|Bhrung Gati Tab Pavai||
Taji Sakal Asa Shabd Vasa| Kaga Hans Kahavai||
Sahibji says that like in the evolution of the Bhrunga, if
you attune to my words dedicatedly, then I will transform
you in to my own similer state and level. Sahibji says that
the soul who does not think of anything else but the
Satguru’s words will reach me, when the disciple whole-
heartedly accepts the word of the Satguru and has
complete faith in the same; he will transmute himself to
the form and substance of the Satguru like the Bhrunga.
He, who faithfully and loyally sticks to and believes only
in the word of the Satguru, will transform himself from a
crow into divine Swan (Hansa).
Dharman Sun Tum Mrutak Subhava|
Mrutak Hoy Satguru Pad Pava||
Mrutak Chhoh Nibhav Ur Dhare|
Chhoh Nibhavahi Jiv Ubare||
Sahib now says that only a rare soul who learns the art of
death while living attains to the state of the Satguru.
Anyone with his heart laden with love, and who conducts
himself as per the word of the Satguru, will be liberated
from this worldly ocean of life (Sansar) while living
(Jeevan Mukta). He will help others, to attain liberation.
Jas Pruthvi Kai Ganjan Hoi| Chit Anurag Gaho Gun Soi||
Koi Chandan Koi Vishtha Dare| Koi Kodi Krushi Anusare||
Gun Avagun Tinha Sam Kar Jana|Maha Virodh Adhik Sukh

Just as this earth is abused and violated, but still
maintains its equanimity, so also one should maintain and
tolerate one’s equanimity. There may be showers of
fragrant sandal and there may also be showers of dirt and
dirty insect but the earth tolerates all such abuses with
equanimity. It considers both honors and insults equally


Anuragsagar Vani 16
and does not oppose or resist any such abuse, while
remaining in peace.
Aur Mrutak Bhav Suni Lehu|
Nirkhi Parkhi Guru Mag Pag Dehu||
Jaise Ukh Kisan Banavai|
Rati Rati Kai Deh Katavai||

Tate Misari Hai Anusara||
Misari Te Jab Kandh Kahava|
Kahe Kabir Sabke Mann Bhava||
Yahi Vidhi Te Jo Shish Sahai|
Guru Krupa Sahaje Bhav Tarai||
Sahibji says that the living dead Jivatmas has one
nature that is more distinct. Just as the farmer grows
sugarcane and then he cuts the sugarcane one by one, then
crushes them and extracts the sugarcane juice. He then
pours the sugarcane juice into big iron pan, heats and
cooks the same to form Jaggery. He further heats the
Jaggery, which forms into the red mass of sugar, which is
further heated and formed into white sugar and further
process into diamond sugar (Kujjewali Mishri), which is
liked by all. Similarly, the disciple, who tolerates and
sustains all the difficulties and pains and still stays firm on
the path marked by the Satguru and with his grace, will
easily cross the ocean of life and reaches Amarlok.
Mrutak Hoy So Sadhu, So Satguru Ko Pavai|
Mete Sakal Upadh, Tasu Dev Asa Karey||
Only such a true sadhu experiences death while
living, who will attain to the Guru’s feet. Such a Sadhu


17 Sahib Bandgi
becomes completely free of worries and attains salvation
by reaching the Amarlok, which even Gods of this heaven
envy.
Sadhu Marg Kathin Dharmadasa|
Rahani Rahe So Sadhu Suvasa||
Pancho Indri Sam Kari Rakhe|
Naam Amiras Nishi Din Chakhey||
Sahibji tells Dharmadasji that the path of a true
Sadhu is very difficult. He who stays within the command
of his Guru and who reins in his five sense organs will be
a sadhu and he will drink the nectar of Naam everyday.
Prathamhi Chakshu Indri Kahey Sadhe|
Guru Gam Panth Naam Avaradhe||
Sundar Rup Chakshu Ki Puja|
Rup Kurup Na Bhave Duja||
Rup Kurup Hi Sam Kar Jane|
Daras Videhi Sada Sukh Mane||
Firstly, he should control his sense of sight and
contemplate on the ‘Naam’, while proceeding on the path
of love for one’s Guru. The eyes always seek and admire
beautiful forms, while refusing to look at anything ugly,
but to a sadhu both beauty and ugliness are the same and
therefore he should only concentrate on the Atma and stay
in constant bliss.
Indri Shravan Vachan Shubh Chahai|
Utkat Vachan Sunat Chit Dahai||
Bol Kubol Dou Sam Lekhe|
Hruday Shudh Gurugyan Vishekhe||
The ears only desire to hear sweet word but if they
hear harsh and rude words, then one’s heart is shaken.
However, for a Sadhu both sweet and harsh words should
be equal.
Nasika Indri Subas Adhina|
Yahi Sam Rakhai Sant Pravina||


Anuragsagar Vani 18
The nose is always desirous of fragrance, but an
intelligent Sadhu should be free of this aspect, and not get
attracted to fragrance.
Jibhya Indri Chahai Swado|
Khatta Mitha Madhur Swado||
Sahaj Bhav Mey Jo Kachhu Avai|
Rokha Phika Nahi Bilagavai||
Jo Koi Panchamrut Le Avai|
Tahi Dekh Nahi Harash Badhavai||
Taje Na Rukha Sag Aluna|
Adhik Prem So Pavai Duna||
The tongue is always appreciative of tasty food but to a
sadhu any food which he gets naturally, even if it is
tasteless or stale, it should not matter to him and he should
not go after the taste that his tongue desires. Even if
someone serves a Sadhu with nectar, he should not be
ecstatic and in case he is served some food without salt, he
should not refuse the same, but eat it happily.
Indri Dusht Maha Aparadhi|
Kutil Kam Koi Virale Sadhe||
Kamini Rup Kal Ki Khani|
Tajahu Tasu Sang Ho Gurugyani||
The sense of lust is hugely wicked and criminal, which is
rarely controlled by anyone.Therefore one should think of
a beautiful woman as a trap, set by kalpurush and should
sacrifice the same and anyone who does so, will be the
wise one or a true Sadhu.
Jabahi Kam Umang Tan Avai|
Tahi Samay Jo Ap Jugave||
Shabd Videh Surat Lai Rakhe|
Gahi Mann Maun Naam Ras Chakhe||
Jab Hiy Tatva Mey Jay Samai|
Tabahi Kam Rahai Murajhai||
Another hallmark of a true Sadhu is that when he
is overcome by lust, he will cleverly save himself from
such lust and keeps it at bay. In such a situation one


19 Sahib Bandgi
should concentrate on the saar shabd (holy Naam), keep
silent while keeping the mind still and drink the substance
of true Naam , if one concentrates on the Naam, then the
lust becomes helpless and will simply sub-side.
Kam Parbal Ati Bhayankar,
Maha Darun Kal Ho|
Sur Nar Muni Yaksh Gandharv Kinnar,
Sabahin Kinh Behal Ho||
Sabahi Lute Birale Chhute,
Gyan Guru Jinha Drud Gahe|
Guru Gyan Dip Samip Satguru,
Bhakti Marag Tinha Lahe||
Sahib further says that lust (kam) is immensely powerful
and is a prime weapon of kalpurush who has troubled all
the Gods and Goddesses, Humans, Rishi-Munis, Yakshas,
Kinnars etc Lust has exploited everyone without
exception. Only a rare one, who is firmly entrenched in
the Guru’s word and is always alert and awake, can escape
lust. It will be the abode of the Satguru wherever there is
the light of Gurugyan. It is only such Jivatma, who
received Naam from Satguru, and abides by the path of
devotion attains permanent salvation (mukti).

Koyi Na Yam Se Bachiya, Naam Bina Dhari Khaye.
Jo Jan Birhi Naam Ke, Ta Ko Dekhi Daraye.
None in this world can escape death. Without the
holy Naam, one is sure to be devoured by Kal. Only those
who are in possession of the holy Naam, can escape death.
Kal itself runs away in fear from those who are devoted to
the holy Naam.

earth in the sky and even dies if it comes down to the
earth. It even sleeps in the sky while airborne. It has no

nest. It stays and consumes only air and no food grains at
all. It does not engage in sex, but impregnate the female
bird with his mere sight. The female bird lays the eggs
while airborne, and the egg starts descending and while
descending from such a great height the egg warms up and
hatches into the young bird, unlike a hen that warms her
eggs beneath her body. Even while a new born baby bird
is still descending from the sky, it opens it’s eyes. If the
bird were to fall upon the earth, he would die. However
before this happens the young bird becomes active and
instinctively knows that it’s abode is not on the earth and
coming to it’s senses completely starts flying up towards
it’s abode in the sky and It’s parent birds never come to
take it. There are many birds in this world, but none of
them is as pure and flawless as the Anal Pakshi. Just as
Anal Pakshi by himself moves towards the abode of his
parent. Some rare Jivatmas contemplate on the Naam of
the Satguru and by overcoming the kalpurush attain the
Satyalok.
Mann Vachan Karma Guru Dhyan,
Guru Agya Nirakhat Chaley||
Dehi Mukti Guru Dan,

He who obeys and meditates on the Satguru in his
thought, words and actions and always abides by the
word. He will be blessed by the Satguru, with the bodiless
Naam and attains true salvation.
Jab Lag Dhyan Videh Na Avey|
Tab Lag Jiv Bhav Bhataka Khavey||
Dhyan Videh Au Naam Videha|

The Jivatma keeps wandering until such time that
his concentration (dhyan) does not attain a bodiless state,
when one unravels the mystery of bodiless concentration
and bodiless Naam. Everyone chants different Names
related to the body with one’s mouth, but this bodiless
Naam is earned by only a rare few. The illusion that the
human beings live in, cannot be eliminated without the
Sar Shabd, even if one bathes in all the pilgrim centres
and visits all the sixty-eight (68) pilgrimages or even
circumambulates the earth. Sahibji says that he cannot
appropriately describe the limitless power of Naam and
whosoever, mentally chants the same, will never fear
death.
Sar Shabd Su Videh Swarupa| Niachar Vahi Rup Anupa||
Tatva Prakruti Prabhav Sab Deha|Sar Shabd Nitatva

Sar Naam Satguru So Pavey|Tab Hansa Amar Lok

Dharmaray Tako Sir Nave|Jo Hansa Nitatva Samave||
Saar shabd is formless and bodiless, cannot be spelt in
Alphabets and is unique. Human body is made of five
elements, but the Sar Shabd is not formed of any element
and is therefore bodiless. Dharmaraj salutes such a
Jivatma who is blessed with the Saar Naam from Satguru
and by climbing; the thread of this Saar Naam escapes the
worldly ocean (sansar), and reaches his own abode in
Amarlok and merges in inmmortal Amartatva
(Satyapurush).

Dharmadasji requests Sahibji to narrate about the
whereabouts of Amarlok. The status and situation of the
Jivatmas in Amarlok. The food and language of the
Jivatma in Amarlok. The creation of Trilok and creation
of Kalpurush himself, the formation of sixtin sons of
Satyapurush, the placement of the pure souls into four
classes of life, the reason behind the entrapment of the
Jivatmas in the clutches of kalpurush, the creation of
Tridevas, the creation of the earth, the sky, the sun, the
moon and stars etc. Dharmadasji again prays to sahibji to


Anuragsagar Vani 24
reveal to him the whole mystery behind the creation of the
universe, so that all his doubts will be cleared.
Adi Utpati Kaho Satguru, Krupa Karo Nij Das Ko|
Bachan Sudha Su Prakash Kijai, Nash Ho Yam Tras Ko||
Ek Ek Viloy Barnahu, Das Mohi Nij Jani Kai|
Satya Vakta Satguru Tum, Lev Nishchaya Mey Mani Kai||
Dharmadasji again prays to Sahibji that He, be
kind to this servant and reveal to him the mysterious facts
about creation. He is again entreating that, Sahibji reveal
every minute details about the creation of the universe and
that whatever he told by Sahibji will be believed by him,
as Sahibji is truthful and honest.
SAHIB SAYS
Dharmdas Adhikari Paya|
Tate Main Kahi Bhed Sunaya||
Ab Tum Sunahu Adi Ki Bani|
Bhakha Utpati Pralay Nishani||
Now Sahibji is replying that whenever any
deserving soul enquires with him of the above matters, he
will definitely reveal all.
Tabaki Bat Sunhu Dharmdasa|
Jab Nahi Mahi Patal Akasha||
Jab Nahi Kurm Barah Au Shesha|
Jab Nahi Sharad Gor Ganesha||
Jab Nahi Hate Niranjan Raya|

Taitis Koti Devata Nahi|
Aur Anek Bataiun Kahin||
Brahma Vishnu Mahesh Na Tahiya|
Shasta Ved Puran Na Kahiya||
Tab Sab Rahe Purush Ke Mahi|
Jyon Bat Vruksha Madhya Rah Chahi||
Sahibji says to Dharmadas that he will start from
the time before the earth, the sky, Kurma, Shesh, Varah,
Sharada, Gowri, Ganesh etc.came into existence. This is
about the time when Niranjan, who is torturing the


25 Sahib Bandgi
Jivatmas also did not exist nor even the thirty-three crores
Godheads existed. Sahib says even Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesh nor even Vedas, Shastras, Puranas came into
existence and only Parampurush existed and all the
Jivatmas were part of Him like the shade of banyan tree
stays within it’s midst.
Adi Utpati Sunahu Dharman,
Koi Na Janat Tahi Ho |
Sabhi Bho Vistar Pachhe,
Sakh Deu Main Kahi Ho||
Ved Charon Nahin Janat,
Satya Purush Kahaniya|
Ved Ko Tab Mul Nahi,
Akath Katha Bakhaniya||
Sahib says to Dharmadas that he is revealing the
precreation mystery that no one knows. Neither neither
Sakar nor Nirakar existed two forms of worship and even
the fourteen Lokas were created much later and hence
there is no one, who can corroborate the mysteries that
Sahib would reveal. Even the four Vedas are ignorant and
silent about the existence of the Satyapurush but only
speak about the episodes relating to Kalpurush.

Sahas Athasi Dip Rachi Rakha|
Purush Icha Tai Sab Abhilakha||
Sabai Dwip Rahu Agar Samayi|


Anuragsagar Vani 26
Agar Vasana Bahut Suhayi||
Sahib says that in the very beginning,
Parampurush was unmanifest, he had no companion or
partner and he was in bliss at some point of time he willed
it and he created a unit of himself. Firstly, he pronounced
one word, and created a magnificient and brilliant white
light and merged himself into that brilliance, which came
to be known as Amarlok. Then he willed again and
created many islands. This truth this was held secret.
Then Sahib says, that foremost willed and uttered one
word, due to which a magnificient white brilliant light
emerged which spread infinite. This brilliance was
uncomparable to any worldly light, it was so magnificient,
and each particles of this brilliant light would put to same
millions of Suns.
When this magnificient brilliant light, spread
into the infinite, Satyapurush himself became one with
this brilliance and this brilliance came to life and was
simply vibrating, with lifeforce. This magnificient
brilliance came alive just as a body comes to life with an
Atma entering the same. Before entering the magnificient
light, Satyapurush himself was unknown. When this
brilliant light entered, it becomes Satpurush, and it is
refferd as Amarlok.
Even then Satyapurush was alone. Then he
willed and sprinkled some parts of this magnificient light
from himself. Infinite particles of this light came into
being, than entered in to these magnificient lights. Just as
when one takes handful of water from the sea and sprays it
above, several particles of water are scattered around. Just
as the particles of water fall back into the sea and they
become one with it.Unlike this these infinite particles of
magnificient light also entered this light but surprisingly
they remained a separate entity. Since Satyapurush willed
that, these particles of light must have their own


27 Sahib Bandgi
individual identity. These particles came to be known as
Hansa (Individual Soul). All these Hansaa started
blissfully living amidst of this magnificient light.
The individual identity of Hansa in the
magnificient light is a miraculous thing, unlike the
particles of the water from the sea when scattered and
again fell back, into the sea. They lose their individual
identity. However, just like the fish move about the sea,
all the Hansas also started moving about in this
magnificient light that is Satyalok. On seeing this,
Parampurush was immensely pleased and showerd Love.
For a long long time, these Hansas were inhabiting this
magnificient Satlok and enjoying themselves. Then later
Parampurush uttered some more words and created sons;
in the sense that each utterence took the form of a son.
Niranjan Dhan Tumro Durbar,Jahan Tanik Na Nyaye
Vichar.
Rung Mahal Mein Basein Muskhre, Pass Tere Sardar.
Dhoor-Dhoop Mein Sadhu Birajain, Bhaye Jo Bhavnidhi
Par.
Veshya Aurey Khasa Malmal, Gal Motiyan Ko Har.
Pativrata Ko Milai Na Khadi, Sukha Niras Ahar.
Pakhandi Ko Jug Mein Adar, Sant Ko Kahain Labar.
Agyani Ko Param Viveki, Geyani Ko Moor Ganwar.
Kah-hin Kabir Faqeer Pukari, Ulta Sabb Vyavhar.
Sanch Kahey Jug Maran Dhaye, Jhuthan Ko Aitbar.
Every thing in this world of Kal Niranjan is
abnormal. There is nothing like justice and fair play here.
Here the hypocrites are accorded warm welcome while the
followers of truth are made to suffer. The people of the
world believe in all that the hypocrites and unreal sages
say but they do not care for what the Sants say.

As soon as Parampurush uttered the second word,
Kurmaji was formed. Similarly, he uttered the third word
Gyan (wisdom) was born and with the fourth word Vivek


29 Sahib Bandgi
was born. Parampurush as per his will created all those
son but, the jivatmas were not created because of his will,
since they were part of Parampurush himself. Then
Parampurush uttered the fifth word in a shrill and loud
voice due to which Niranjan was created. By uttering the
sixth word, Sahaj was born and from the seventh word
Santosh, from the eleventh word Nishkam, from twelfth
Jalrangi, from the thirteenth Achinta, from the fourteenth
Prem, from the fifteenth Dindayal, from the sixteenth
Dhairya, from the seventeenth Yog Santayan was born.
Parampurush was conjoined to all the sixteen sons by a
single thread of the spiritual concentration (Surati) of him.
Shabdahith Bhayo Sutan Akara| Shabd Te Lok Dwip Vistara||
Agra Ami Diy Ansh Ahara| Dwip Dwip Anshan Baithara||
Anshan Shobha Kala Ananta| Hoth Taha Sukh Sada Basanta||
Sab Sut Kare Purush Ko Dhyana| Ami Ahar Sada Sukh Mana||
Parampurush created his sixteenth sons and the
islands of Amarlok with the utterance of his words. On
each island, Jivatmas were provided their own space and
all of them started partaking of the nectar (form of
Parampurush). The grandeur of these Jivatmas cannot be
described in words; they always live in bliss. All the sons
of Parampurush started meditating upon him and partook
of the nectar and they were living in complete joy and
bliss.
Dwip Kari Ko Anant Sobha, Nahin Barnat So Banai|
Amiya Kala Apar Adbhut, Sutan Shobha Ko Ganai||
Purush Ke Ujiyar Se Sut,Sabai Dip Ujiyar Ho|
Satpurush Rom Prakash Ekhi,Chandr Sury Karor Ho||
The grandeur of the islands in Amarlok and that
of his sons cannot be described in words. All the islands
of Amarlok are brilliantly illuminated with the
magnificient light of Parampurush; each strand of this
light is equal to the light of millions of Suns and Moons.
Satpur Anand Dham, Sok Moh Dukh Taha Nahi|


Anuragsagar Vani 30
Hansan Ko Bisram, Purush Daras Anchvan Sudha||
Satyalok is an abode laden with bliss, which is
free of sorrows and sentimental attachment. Atmas in the
form of swan, partake nectar of Satyapurush in satyalok.

### 8 Kal Niranjan does penance..........................

Yahi Bidhi Bahut Divas Gayo Biti|

Dharmaray As Kinha Tamasa|
So Charitra Bujhahu Dharmadasa||
Yug Sattar Seva Tin Kinha|
Ik Pag Thadh Purush Chit Dinha|
Seva Kathin Bhanti Tin Kinha|
Adi Purush Harshit Hoy Chinha||
Everyone in Amarlok was living in bliss for a
long time. Thereafter the fifth son of Niranjan started
meditating on Parampurush. He meditated on
Parampurush for 70 eras (Yug), standing on a single feet
with total concentration. Being pleased with his hard
penance Parampurush appeared before Niranjan.
PARAMPURUSH ASKS
Purush Awaj Uthi Tab Bani| Kaha Jani Tum Seva Thani||
Parampurush asked Niranjan about the reason for
hard penance and service unto him.
NIRANJAN REPLIES
Kahai Dharam Tab Sis Naamayi|
Dehu Thaur Jahan Baithon Jayi||
Niranjan requested Sahibji to grant him some
independent space.
PARAMPURUSH SAYS
Agya Kiye Jahu Sut Tahavan|
Mansarovar Dip Hai Jahavan||
Parampurush granted Niranjan’s request and tells
him to go and live on the Manasarovar Island.


31 Sahib Bandgi
Chale Dharam Tab Mansarovar|
Bahut Harashchit Karat Kalohar||
Mansarovar Aye Jahiya|
Bhaye Anand Dharam Puni Tahiya||
Bahuri Dhyan Purush Ko Kinha|
Sattar Yug Seva Chit Dinha||
Yak Pagu Thadhe Seva Seva Layi|
Purush Dayal Daya Ur Ayi||
Kal Niranjan became happy after coming at
Manasarovar Island and he was living in blisss there.
Here, he again started meditating on Parampurush. Again,
he meditated another 70 eras, standing on single foot
Parapurush was deeply moved with kindness.
Vikasyo Puhup Uthyo Jab Bani|
Bolat Vachan Uthyo Adharani||
Jahu Sahaj Tum Dharam Kai Pasa|
Ab Kas Dhyan Kinha Paragasa||
Now Parampurush sent Sahaj to Niranjan to
enquire as to why he was meditating again and what it is
that he wants.
Chale Sahaj Tab Sis Navai|
Dharamray Pahan Pahunche Jai||
Kahe Sahaj Sun Bhrata Mora|
Seva Purush Man Lai Tora||
Ab Ka Mangahu So Kah Mohi|
Purush Awaj Dinha Yah Tohi||
After taking permission from
Parampurush, Sahaj came to Niranjan and told him that,
Parampurush was pleased with his service and therefore
he has sent message to ask Niranjan, as to what he wants
now.
NIRANJAN SAYS
Aho Sahaj Tum Jethe Bhai|
Karo Purush So Binti Jai||
Itna Thanav Na Mohi Suhai|


Anuragsagar Vani 32
Ab Mohi Bakasi Dehu Thakurai||
More Chit As Bhau Anurag|
Deu Desh Mohi Karahu Sabhaga||
Kai Mohi Dehu Lok Adhikara|
Kai Mohi Dehu Des Yak Nyara||
Niranjan replied to Sahaj that since he was his
elder brother, he should go to Parampurush and with
humility tell him that he was not happy with only
Mansarovar and he should kindly grant him the domain of
the Amarlok itself or another separate domain where he
can freely exercise his authority.
Chale Sahaj Suni Dharm Ke Bata |
Jay Purush So Kahe Vikhyata||
Jo Kachu Dharmaray Abhilashi|
Taise Sahaj Sunaye Bhashi||
Sahaj came back to Parampurush with the message
from Niranjan and conveyed the same to him.
Sunyo Sahaj Ke Bachan Jabahi,
Purush Bain Uchareu||
Dharam Se Santusht Hai Hum,
Bachan Mam Hiy Dhareu||
Lok Tinon Tahi Dinho,
Shunya Desh Basavahu||
Karahu Rachana Jay Tahanvan,
Sahaj Vachan Sunavahu||
On hearing from Sahaj about Niranjan’s message,
Parampurush said that he was indeed very pleased with
Niranjan and told him to convey to Niranjan that he is
granted seventeen innumerable quadruple eras of reign
and governance and that he should create a separate
domain of his own in the Shunya Lok.
Aya Sahaj Tab Vachan Sunava|
Satya Purush Jas Kahi Samujhava||
Sunatahin Bachan Dharma Harashana|
Kachuk Harash Kachhu Vismaya Ana||


33 Sahib Bandgi
When Sahaj conveyed to Niranjan the message of
Parampurush, Niranjan felt very happy, but also felt a
little surprise.
Kahe Dharm Sunu Sahaj Piyara|
Kaise Rachaun Karaun Vistara||
Purush Dayal Dinha Mohi Raju|
Janu Na Bhed Karon Kim Kaju||
Gamya Agamya Mohi Nahin Ayi|

Aho Bhrat Balihari Tori||
Kihi Vidhi Rachun Nau Khand Banai|
He Bhrata So Agya Pai||
Mo Kahan Dehu Saj Prabhu Soi|
Jate Rachana Jagat Ki Hoi||
Niranjan now said to Sahaj that Parampurush
has awarded him the domain of Trilok, but he does not
know how to construct and create the same or how to go
about it. He further said that he should be given material
with which he can create and construct a domain of
Triloks that has been granted to him.
Tabahi Sahaj Lok Pagu Dhara|
Kinha Dandavat Barambara||
Sahaj then came back to Parampurush and lay
prostrate before him.
Aho Sahaj Kas Ihava Au|
So Humso Tum Sabd Sunau||
Parampurush asked Sahaj as to why he has come now.
Kahyo Sahaj Tab Dharma Ki Bata|
Jo Kachhu Dharma Kahi Vikhyata||
Sahaj conveyed to Parampurush about Niranjan’s
request.
Agya Purush Dinha Tehi Bara|
Suno Sahaj Tum Bachan Humara||
Kurm Udar Ahi Sab Saja|
So Le Dharam Kare Nij Kaja||
Vinati Kare Kurm So Jayi|


Anuragsagar Vani 34
Mangi Lei Tehi Math Navayi||
Now Parampurush ordered Sahaj and told him that all the
material for creation were present in the stomach of
Kurmaji; he should also tell Niranjan to go to Kurmaji and
request him to give the material for creation, which lay in
his stomach.
Gaye Sahaj Puni Dharm Kai Pasa|
Agya Purush Kinh Pargasa||
Vinati Karo Kurm So Jai|
Mangi Lehu Tehi Sis Navai||
Jay Kurm Dhig Sis Navavahu|
Karihain Krupa Bahut Tab Pavahu||
Sahaj then came to Niranjan, conveyed to him the
order of Parampurush, and told him to go to kurmaji and
request him to give the material required for creation and
that Kurmaji would surely oblidge.
Chali Bhau Dharam Harash Tab Badho|

Niranjan very arrogantly approached Kurmaji. He
neither made any polite request nor paid any respect due
to kurmaji. However, Kurmaji was very calm, and serene,
he did not get angry. Niranjan got very aggressive and
with fury started running around kurmaji, while thinking
as to how he could snatch the material for creation from
him. He attacked on kurmaji’s head with his claws. He
chopped of the three heads of kurmaji and ate them. Then
he tore kurmaji’s stomach and snatched the five elements
of the Earth, Sky, Sun, Moon, Stars etc from inside. With
all these materials, Niranjan came to Shunya and ceated
and constructed the domain of Trilokas, but all this was
lifeless.
Kurmaji says
Adi Kurma Rah Lok Manjhara|Tin Puni Dhyan Purush
Anusara||
Nirankar Kinho Bariyaya|Kal Kala Dhari Mopahan Aya||
Udar Bidar Kinha Un Mora|Agya Jani Kinha Nahin
Thora||
On the other side kurmaji meditated on
Parampurush and complained about the misdeeds of
Nirankar (Niranjan) and as to how he forcibly tore his
stomach, but still he did not resist, since it was the
command of Parampurush.
Parampurush replies
Purush Awaj Kinha Tehi Bara| Chhot Vah Ahi Tumhara||
Ahi Yahi Badan Ki Riti| Augun Thava Karahin Vah Priti||


Anuragsagar Vani 36
Parampurush pacified Kurmaji by saying that
Niranjan was his younger brother and that it is the duty of
elders to forgive the younger ones, even when they trouble
the elder. Parampurush also said that the elder should love
the younger one.

### 9 Niranjan does penance yet again....................

Purush Dhyan Puni Kinha Niranjan |

Ek Pav Tab Seva Kiyau|
Chausath Yug Lo Thadhe Raheu||
Niranjan created trilokas like the heaven, patal and
the mortal world, but then thought as to how he could
extend and expand the trilokas. Since he did not have the
seeds, he could not create the bodies and all that he had
created was lifeless creation, as he did not have the living
beings like the swans in Amarlok. Worrying on these lines
Niranjan once again standing on single foot in Shunya,
meditated on Parampurush for another 64 eras , aspiring
for the three lokas to be full of life and living beings, as
still the three lokas that he has created were lifeless and
bland.
Dayanidhi Satpurush Sahib, Bas Suseva Ke Bhaye|
Bahuri Bhashyo Sahaj Seti,Kaha Ab Yachat Naye||
Jahu Sahaj Niranjan Pahan,Deu Jo Kucha Mangai||
Karahi Rachana Purush Vachana,Chal,Mata Sab Tyagai||


37 Sahib Bandgi
Parampurush again yielded to meditation and
service of Niranjan and again sent Sahaj to Niranjan.
Chale Sahaj Sirnay, Jabahi Purush Agya Kiyo |
Tahava Pahunche Jay,Jaha Niranjan Thadh Raho||
Sahaj then bowing to the command of Parampurush
comes to Niranjan.
Dekhat Sahaj Dharm Harshana|Seva Bas Purush Tab
Jana||
On seeing Sahaj approaching him, Niranjan
understood that Parampurush was again pleased with his
service.
Tabai Sahaj As Bhashe Linha|
Sunahu Dharm Tohi Purush Sab Dinha||
Kurm Udar So Jo Kachu Ava|
So Tohi Den Purush Pharamava||
Tin Lok Raj Tohi Dinha|
Rachana Rachahu Hohu Jani Bhina||
Kahai Sahaj Sunahu Dharmaraya|
Kehi Karan Ab Seva Laya||
Sahaj asked Niranjan why he was again making
penance, even after Parampurush has granted him the
domain of the three lokas and after he has already taken
the material from the stomach of kurmaji.
Tabai Niranjan Vinati Layi|
Kaise Rachana Rachu Banayi||
Purush Hi Kaho Jori Yug Pani|
Main Sevak Dutiya Nahi Jani||
Purush So Vinti Karo Humara|
Dije Khet Bij Nij Sara||
Main Sevak Dutiya Nahi Janu|
Dhyan purush ka nishi din anu||
Niranjan replies that he has no seeds left for
creation .So he wants seeds for the creation and wants
Jivatmas over whom he can rule.
Sahaj Kahyo Puni Purush Hi Jai|


Anuragsagar Vani 38
Jas Kachu Kahyo Niranjan Rai||
Sahaj came back to Parampurush and conveyed
the prayer of Niranjan.
Icha kin purush tehi bara| Ashtangi Kanya Upchara||
Asht Bahu Kanya Hoy Ai|Bayen Ang So Thadh Rahai||
Math Nai Purush So Kahai| Aho Purush Agya Kas Ahai||
On hearing, this Parampurush created a female form
(Adya shakti) who has eight arms. Adyashakti then asked
Parampurush about his purpose behind creating her.
Tabahi Purush Vachan Pargasa|
Putri Jahu Dharam Ke Pasa||
Dehun Vastu So Lehu Samhari|
Rachahu Dharm Mili Utpati Vari||
Dinho Bij Jiv Puni Soi|
Naam Suhang Jiv Kar Hoi||
Jiv Sohangam Dusar Nahi |
Jiv So Ansh Purush Ko Ahi||
Parampurush handed innumerable souls to
Adyashakti and addressing her as his daughter, asked her
to go to Niranjan in Mansarovar with these Atmas and
along with Niranjan create a true world like Amarlok.He
also told her that Sohang is the Name of the Jiva and that
Jiva is a part of the Parampurush himself.
Purush Seva Vash Bhaye, Tab Ashtangahin Dinha Ho |
Mansarovar Jahu Kahiya,Dehu Dharmahin Chinha Ho|
Ashtangi Kanya Hati,Jehi Rup Shobha Ati Bani|
Jahu Kanya Mansarovar,Karahu Rachana Ati Ghani||
Yielding to the service and penance by Niranjan,
Parampurush sent the eight armed Adyashakti along with
the Jivatmas to Niranjan in Mansarovar.
Chaurasi Lakh Jiv, Mul Bij Tehi Sang De ||
Rachana Rachahu Sajiv, Kanya Chali Sir Naya Ke||
Parampurush while handling Jivatmas to Adyashakti
ordained that she should create only true creation that is,
she should not bind Atmas in perishable bodies.


39 Sahib Bandgi
Adyashakti after paying obeisance to Parampurush set out
for Mansarovar.

Karahu Srushti Jas Tum Man Bhava||
Man Sarovar Jahi Rahahu|
Tate Hoi Hai Srushti Urahu||
After Adyashakti left for Mansarovar, Parampurush
immediately called Sahaj and asked him to go to Niranjan
and say that he has been given the material that he had
asked for and that the original seeds have been sent to him
and he should now go to Manasarovar and do his creation.
Chale Sahaj Tahava Tab Aye|
Dharma Dhir Jahan Thadh Rahaye||
Kaheu Su Vachan Purush Ko Jabahi |

After getting, the command of Parampurush Sahaj
came to Niranjan and conveyed him the message of
Parampurush.

Anuragsagar Vani 40
Niranjan came to Manasarovar and took his
seat after receiving the message of Parampurush. On
seeing Adyashakti approaching towards him, he became
very happy. Adyashakti was an embodiment of
innumerable arts extremely beautiful and Kalpurush, on
seeing her was bewitched and overcome with lust.
Niranjan caught Adyashakti’s legs by one hand and her
head by another hand and simply swallowed her. From
this moment, he came to be known as Kalpurush or Kal
Niranjan.
Kino Gras Kal Anyai| Tab Kanya Chit Vismay Lai||
Tatchan Kanya Kinha Pukara|Kal Niranjan Kinha
Ahara||
As soon as Niranjan swallowed her, Adyashakti
called out to Parampurush and told that Kal Niranjan has
eaten her.
Tabahi Dharm Sahaj Lag Ai|
Sahaj Shunya Tab Linha Chudai||
Then Niranjan went to Sahaj and banished him from
there, by misusing the power he had gained from the
penance.

Yahi Charitra Purush Bhal Jani|

Lacha Jiv Nit Grasan Karahu|
Sava Lachha Nit Prati Bistarahu||
On Adyashakti’s communication, Parampurush
remembered that Niranjan had torn the stomach of Kurma
earlier to take out the seeds for creation and now he has
even swallowed Adyashakti. Parampurush was very bitter
about it and he cursed Niranjan that his stomach will not
be satiated, even when he swallows a lakh Jivas everyday


41 Sahib Bandgi
and he would create one and a quarter lakh of Jivas
everyday.
Puni Kinha Purush Tiwan | Tihi Chan Meti Dari Kal Ho||
Kathin Kal Karal Jivan |Bahut Karai Bihal Ho||
Yahi Metath Sabe Mitihain| Bachan Dol Adolasan||
Parampurush thought that he will eliminate
Kalpurush, as he felt that he would now torture the
Jivatmas, but he remembered that he had already granted
him seventeenn countless quadruple eras of domain and
lordship. He thought that if he eliminates him now his
word will be falsified and since he has conjoined sixteen
sons by a single thread of concentration (surati). The rest
of his sons will also be eliminated along with Kalpurush.
Dolai Vachan Hamar, Jo Ab Meta Dharam Ko|
Vachan Karo Pratipal, Desh Mor Ab Na Lahain||
As Parampurush wanted that his word be kept, he cursed
Kalpurush that he can never enter Satyalok again nor
could be see or meet him ever.

Parampurush summoned Yogjit (kabir sahib). In facts,
Parampurush himself became Yogjit. He churned himself
and extracted Kabir Sahib. In addition, told him to banish
Niranjan from Manasarovar so that he can never re-enter
Satyalok again. He told Kabir Sahib to tell Adyashakti
that she should meditate on Parampurush and come out
after tearing open of Niranjan’s stomach. This way


Anuragsagar Vani 42
Niranjan will be melted out, the punishment for tearing
Kurmaji’s stomach. He also told Kabir Sahib to tell
Niranjan that Adyashakti became his own now and that
along with her he should reside in the Swarglok (heaven)
Mrutulok (mortalworld) and Patal lok (underground
world) that Niranjan has created.
Jogjit Chal Bhe Sir Nai|
Masarovar Pahunche Jai||
Jogjit Ko Dekha Jabahi |
Ati Bho Kal Bhayankar Tabahi||
Pucha Kal Kaun Tum Ahu|
Kaun Kaj Tum Yaha Sidhahu||
Yogjit after paying obeisance to Parampurush came
to Manasarovar. When Niranjan saw Yogjit, he became
very angry and ferocious and questioned him, who was
he? And why was he there?
Jogjit As Kahe Pukari|
Aho Dharma Tum Grasehu Nari||
Agya Purush Dinha Yah Mohi|
Ihite Begi Nikaro Tohi||
Jogjit Kanya Ko Kahiya |
Nari Kahe Udar Mahan Rahiya||
Udar Phari Ab Avahu Bahar |
Purush Tej Sumiro Tohi Thahar||
Yogjit replied that he was there at the command
of the Parampurush to banish him from Manasarovar
because of his act of swallowing Adyashakti. Then Yogjit
asked Adyashakti why she was sitting in the stomach of
Niranjan. He told her to meditate on Parampurush, tear
open Niranjan’s stomach and step out.
Sunike Darm Krodh Ur Zareu |
Jogjit So Sanmukh Bhireu ||
Jogjit Tab Kinhe Dhyana |
Purush Pratap Tej Ur Ana||
Purush Agya Bhai Tehi Kala |

43 Sahib Bandgi
Jogjit Puni Taiso Kinha |
Jas Agya Purush Tehi Dinha ||
On hearing all this from Yogjit , Niranjan angrily charged
at Yogjit to fight him .Yogjit then remembered Param
purush and then drawing power and energy from
Parampurush focused his concentration ( Surati ) on
Niranjan , which simply made him unconscious.
Gahi Bhuja Phatakar Dinho ,

Bahuri Utheu Samhar Ho ||
Nirasi Kanya Udar Te,

Kaho Kaun Vidhi Kahanva Pari ||
Then Yogjit caught Niranjan by his arms and swung him
out of Amar lok down into Shunya lok Kal Niranjan was
terrified with Yogjit, he gathered himself and got up and
Adyashakti forced herself out of Niranjan’s stomach. She
suddenly started fearing Niranjan and wondered how she
had come there. She felt sorry that she could not go back
to Amarlok again.
Kamini Rahi Saka, Trasit Kal Dar Adhika |
Rahi So Sis Navay, As Pas Chitavat Khadi ||
Full of fear of Niranjan, Adyashakti bowed her head and
stood near Niranjan.
Niranjan says
Kahe Dharma Sunu Adi Kumari |
Ab Jani Darapo Tras Humari ||
Purush Racha Tohi Hamare Kaja |
Ik Mati Hoy Karahu Upraja ||
Hum Hai Purush Tumahin Ho Nari |
Ab Jani Darapo Tras Humari ||
Then Niranjan addressed Adyashakti as Kumari (Maiden)
and asked her not to fear him, as Parampurush had created
her to assist him. Therefore two of them shall rule


Anuragsagar Vani 44
together. He said that he is the man (Purush ) and she his
woman (Nari ) and that there was no need for her to fear
him.
Adhya shakti Replies

Ab To Aho Humare Tata |
Niramal Drushti Ab Chitavahu Mohi |

Adyashakti said to Niranjan that she could not understand,
what he was saying. She reasoned that in one way he
would be elder brother, as they were both the children of
Parampurush and in another way she has now become his
daughter as he had swallowed her and that she had come
out of his stomach, making him infact her father.
Therefore she requested him to look upon her with pure
thoughts, free of lust, otherwise he would be sinning.
Niranjan now says
Kahe Niranjan Suno Bhavani |

Niranjan firmly told her that he does not care about
sinning or doing good deeds because he is the one who


45 Sahib Bandgi
will now define both and there is no one to whom he
would now to account for. He even said in the time to
come he is going to create a web of both bad and good
deeds (Pap and Punya ) and everyone would get entangled
and trapped in it and would never be free to get out of
there and stay enslaved to him for ever.

Adyashakti then simply smiled to him in consent, agrying
all that he said to her and in an endearing tone started
conversing with him secretively and declared her
willingness to stay with him.

Sahibji says to Dharmadas that Niranjan had taken away
the five elements from the stomach of Kurmaji and also
had eaten up his three heads from which were formed
three gunas (tendencies) of Rajogun (Bharmha) Satvagun
(Vishnu) and Tamogun (Shiv). From the five elements and
three gunas Niranjan created the whole universe.

Aisa Koyi Na Milai, Ja So Kahoon Dukh Roye.
Jason Kahiye Bhed Ki, So Phir Bairi Hoye.
Sahibji says that he finds none to whom he can tell his
woes. He, whom he tries to explain the reason behind his
woes, turns into his foe. The Sants hold that this world
belongs to Kal Purush (Lord of death). Sants give the
people of the world information about Amarlok.They are
pained to see the sad plight of the jivas that are made to
suffer the sorrows and pains inherent in the cycle of
repeated births and deaths. However, the worldly people
don’t understand this secret and turn against the holy
Sants.

From trigunas and five elements Niranjan created his
thri sons (Brahma, Vishnu , Mahesh ) and in the same way
from the five elements and three gunas created this world.
First with Rajogun he blended the five elements from
which Bramhmaji was formed, from the Satva gunn and
five elements Vishnu was created then from Tamogun and
five elements Shivji was created. Thus with five elements
and each of three gunas the three bodies of tridev were
created.

Niranjan told Adyashakti that she has all the Jivas and
the seeds of creation and now he is handing over his three
sons too. He declared to her that in form of Nirakar or the
formless, he will blend with the Shunya and will live with
all the Jivas in the form of mind and along with the three
sons must rule the universe. Niranjan also cautioned her
not to reveal his secrets to anyone. He also told her that
since he has assumed form of the invisible mind and
become incognito, none of his sons could ever see him,
even if they lay down their lives in search of him. Thus,
no one must unreveal this mystery. He also told her that
when his sons grow up, she should send them for churning
(Manthan ) the ocean.

resides inside and outside of everyone. This mind never
allows anyone to meditate on the Parampurush.

Anuragsagar Vani 50
When the young tridevas grew up a bit Adyashakti told
them to go for churning of the ocean, but the young
tridevas were engrossed in playing and did not go the
ocean. Just then, Niranjan played a trick. He with the
power of Yoga created air or the atmosphere and when he
released it from his breath, the words of Vedas were
expelled i.e Niranjan spelled out the Vedas in the air, he
wrote no book. This wonder is known to a rare few. Vedas
spelt words in praise of Niranjan and awaited his
command. Then Niranjan ordered Vedas to go and blend
into the ocean and come out at the time of churning of the
ocean and stay with the one who finds him at the time of
the churning of the sea. Niranjan spoke from the sky and
displayed brilliant mass of light (jyoti) but the Vedas
could not see the form of Niranjan. That is why the Vedas
say that they cannot completely describe the complete
appearance and form of the Nirakar / Niranjan. Therefore,
after Niranjan gave out the Vedas he created Tej (Divine
radiance) and asked Tej to blend into the ocean. After Tej,
Niranjan created poison and asked it too to blend into the
ocean. Once the Vedas blended into the ocean, Niranjan
through meditation, communicated with Adyashakti
asking her why there was delay in churning the ocean, that
she should pay attention to his words and to persuade his
three sons immediately and after blessing them, send them
for the churning of the ocean. Upon these, Adyashakti
persuaded her sons, blessed them, and sent them for the
churning of the ocean and told them that there are some
things in the ocean and that they should go fast. Brahmaji
being the eldest, lead two younger brothers (Vishnu and
Shivji) to the ocean.

All three of them went and stood by the ocean and discuss

When they so churned the sea, they found three
objects. Brahmaji got Vedas, Vishnuji the divine
radiance and Shivaji the poison. The three of them
gathered happily and came to their mother. Adyashakti
told them that each of them keep with himself, whatever
one found from the sea.

The mother Adyashakti once more asked the three
sons, to go for the churning of the sea, and take from it,
whatever each one of them found from it and keep it for
him. Just then, Shakti created three maidens and sent them
to blend into the ocean. None of the three sons knew about
this secret and when the three of them churned the ocean
again, they found the three maidens. They took these three
maidens and came to their mother, Adyashakti. She told
them that these maidens were reward for the churning of
the sea and therefore distributed one maiden to each one
of them and asked them to live together with them. Thus,
Savitri was given to Brahmaji, Laxmi to Vishnu and
Parvati to Shivji. On getting these three maidens, the three
brothers became very happy and got deeply engrossed in
the company of their consort, just as deeply as a
enraptured by the sight of beautiful moon in the night.
Thus, the three brothers were enslaved by lust, and were
engaged in them, from which were born the various
Devtas and Daityas. Devtas were born by Brahmaji and
Vishnuji and the Demons were born of Shivji. This is the
reason that in later time Shivji favoured the Demons freely
with many boons.

again went to churn the ocean and this time they returned
with fourteen bejewelled chests to the mother who out of
which gave nectar (Amrut) to Vishnuji and poison to
Shivji.

## 13 Vedas Reveal the Secret to Bramhaji..............

Brahma Ved Padhan Tab Laga |
Padhat Ved Tab Bha Anuraga ||
Kahe Ved Purush Ik Ahi |

Puni Brahma Shivason As Kahaish |

Ahai Purush Ik Ved Betava |
Ved Kahe Ham Bhed Na Pava ||
Bramha studied the Vedas, and learned that there is a
person who is formless (Nirakar). Who has no face or
identity. Who displays mass of light in Shunya and whose
feet extend to the bottom of the underground. (Niranjan,
who has himself spelt the Vedas as spoken only about
himself in effort of his own praise and completely silent
about grandeur or identitity of Parampurush) on reading
the Vedas Brahma got absorbed in the same and came to
Vishnuji and declared to him that Vedas speak of a Purush
who is the originator.
Then Brahma also went to Shivji and told him the
same. He said that on a deeper understanding of the
Vedas, one learns that there is an originator, a person, but
the Vedas say that they do not have a complete picture or
description of this Purush.
Tab Brahma Mata Pah Ava|

55 Sahib Bandgi
Lastly, Brahma came to Adyashakti and inquisitively
pointed to the mother that the Vedas Dictinctly shows that
there is some one who is the origin of all creation and he
is formless and invisible
Brahma Enquires
Brahma Kahe Janani Suno,
Kahahu Kaha Kant Tumhar Hai|
Kijai Krupa Jani Mohi Duravo,
Kahan Pita Hamar Hai ||
Brahma then enquire Adyashakti who her husband was
and requested her to tell him the truth and not to hide
anything from him. He also asked her who their father is.
Shakti replies;
Kahe Janani Suno Brahma,
Kou Nahi Janak Tumhar Ho |
Hamahite Bhai Sabe Utpati,
Hamhin Sab Kin Samahar Ho ||
The mother told Brahma that he has no father.She said
that shecreated him and that she alone is both his mother
and father.
Brahma says,
Brahma Kahe Pukar,
Sunu Janani Tai Chitt De |
Kahat Ved Niruvar ,
Purush Ek So Gupta Hai ||
Brahma told mother that she should seriously hear what he
is saying. He said, that in the Vanis or the Vedas, there is
a definite reference to a person who is incoginito. He
showed her the Vedas.
Shakti Replies;
Kahe Adya Sunu Brahma Kumara |
Mose Nahin Kou Srashta Nyara ||
Swarga Mrutyu Patal Banai|
Sat Samudra Ham Niramai||


Anuragsagar Vani 56
Shakti again replied she alone is a creator.That she who
has created Pataal (hell) and Mortal world and heaven and
also the ocean and there is no creator other than her.
Brahma further says
Mana Vachan Tumahi Sab Kinha |
Pratham Gupta Tum Kas Rakh Linha ||
Jabai Ved Muhi Jahai Bujhai |
Alakh Niranjan Purush Batai ||
Ab Tum Ab Ap Bano Karatara
Pratham Kahe Na Kiya Bichara ||

So Kas Tum Alakh Niranjan Bhakha ||
Ape Ap Aap Niramai |
Kahena Kathan Kin Tum Mai ||
Ab Mosan Tum Chhal Jani Karahu |
Sanche Sanch Sab Kahi Ucharahu ||
Brahma now says even if he agrees that she only has
created everything why she never told earlier, why she
hide it from them and now when the Vedas show to us
that there is person – Niranjan – Nirakar who is invisible,
she still maintains that she alone is the creator. Now if
Adyashakti alone is the creator then she would also have
created Vedas and when Vedas clearly speak about Alak
Niranjan she should come clear of this aspect and not hide
anything from him. Shakti replies
Jab Brahma Yahi Vidhi Hath Thana|
Tab Adya Mann Kinha Tivana||
Kehi Vidhi Yahi Kahun Samajhai|
Vidhi Nahin Manat Mor Badhai||
Jo Yahi Kahaun Niranjan Bata|

Ab Vichar Puni Brahmai Samajhava|

57 Sahib Bandgi
When Bramha became adamant Shakti realized that
Brahma does not believe in what she is saying that she
alone is the creator and wondered how she could convince
him. She felt that if she told him the truth about Niranjan
he would not comprehend it. Because Niranjan has
already told her that no one can see him and if Bramha
asks her to show Niranjan, she would not able to show
him. Therefore, she simply told him that any one could
not see him. Bramha again says
Bramha Kahe Mohin Thaur Batao|
Aga Pichha Jani Tum Lavo|
Main Na Mano Tamhari Bata|
Aisi Bat Na Mohi Suhata||
Pratham Tum Muhi Din Bhulava|
Ab Tum Kaho Na Daras Dikhava||
Tasu Daras Na Paiho Puta|
Aisi Bat Kaho Ajaguta||
Brahma did not agree with Shakti and asked her to tell
him as to where he can find Niranjan since she had first
told him that there is no Niranjan and she was saying that
no one could see him.
Shakti says
Kahe Janani Suno Brahma,
Kahon Toson Satta Hi||
Sat Swarga Hai Math Tako,
Charan Patal Sapta Hi||
Shakti told Brahma that she is telling him the truth and
that is head of Niranjan extends to the limits of the
seventh heaven and his feet extends downwards to the
bottom of the seventh pataal.
Lehu Pushpa Tum Hath, Jo Icha Tihi Darash Ki|
Jay Navao Math, Brahma Chalai Shir Nai Kai||
Shakti then gave him some flowers and told him to offer
Niranjan the flowers if he sees him and Pay obeisance to
him. Now Brahma set about into the sky in search of his
father.

Shakti then realized that Brahma did not believe her

about the existence of Niranjan. Therefore, she now told
him that Alakh Niranjan is indeed his father. Nevertheless,
there is no way that he would get to see him.

Like Brahma, Vishnu also took permission of his
mother and started towards pataal lok to have glimpse of
his father, Niranjan. However, Shivaji did not go
anywhere, he stayed back to serve his mother. Many days
lapsed and the mother was wondering why her sons did all
this.
Pratham Vishnu Janani Dhig Aye|

Vishnu returned first to the mother and told her the
truth that he could not see his father’s feet.

On hearing Vishnu’s truth, the mother blessed him

Vishnu told his mother that on reaching the hell after
collecting the flowers and taking her permission of her, he
confronted Shesh Nag, due to the venom of Shesh Nag.
Vishnu said he became unconscious and that his fair
complexion turned into dark. Vishnu said that SheshNag
advised him to return to his mother and tell her the truth.
Shesh nag also said that after Satyayug, Tretayug,
Dwaparyug arrives and in the Dwaparyug Vishnu will
incarnate as Krishna and then Vishnu would get to avenge
him. But that he should return, soon.That is why Vishnu
says that he returned to his mother (The same SheshNag
incarnated as Kalia Nag in the river Yamuna during the
period of Krishna Avatar).

Sahib after expressing his fondness for Dharmadas, asked
him to be attentive and understand the further events about
Brahma. Sahib says that Brahma had a deep desire to see
his father Niranjan and without wasting time, he set about
on his mission to search and see his father. He reached a
place where there was neither the sun nor the moon and
which was only space. Brahma sat there in meditation and
in various modes started mentally praising his father and
this went on for a long long time. However, Niranjan was
unmoved and Brahma never got to see his father. In this
way, he sat in meditation for over four eras, but still failed
to have a glimpse of Niranjan.

While Brahma was meditating for four eras together and
still could not see Niranjan, his father. His mother Shakti
got anxious about him and was all the time worrying of
his where abouts. Since the process of creation had to
continue. She was thinking about how to ask Brahma to
return and resume his task of creation.

Kya Huwa Vedon Ke Padne Se Na Paya Bheid Ko.
Atma Janey Bina Koyi Gyani Kehlata Nahin.
Study of the Vedas is useless if one fails to find the secret
related to Param Purush. Without having a knowledge of
the Soul, none can be called as a learned man.
After all, what does the Mind desire? It wants that
the Soul should, under no circumstances, have a
knowledge of it. As such, it tries its utmost to keep it away
from its ownself.
Tera Bairi Koyi Nahin, Tera Bairi Munn.
It is none but your Mind is your enemy.

would lose his life. Therefore, she asked Gayatri to do
something. So that Brahma returns soon.

Gayatri reached where Brahma was sitting in deep
meditation, his eyes were closed she waited there for him
for some days, but when she saw that he is not awakening
from his meditation, she started wondering as to how to
awaken him up. So thinking she meditated on AdyaShakti.

father. She also asked who that second woman was

Brahma says

Brahma says that Gayatri and Puhupavati are witness to
his having seen his father, Niranjan and of having touched
his head.

swore that she was telling the truth and that Shakti could
find out the same from Pampavati.

Shakti was bewildered with the false statement of Brahma,
Gayatri, and Puhupavati; she was shocked as to how
Brahma could have seen his father’s face. Because
Niranjan had told her that, he would not be seen by
anyone. Adyashakti did not immediately recognize that all

When cursed so harshly, all the three were disturbed also
due to their misdeeds. They lost their wisdom and
intelligence. Sahib tells Dharmadas that this humongous
spell of Kalpurush affects everyone due to which the lust
and lecherous nature of Maya does not spare anyone, it
has stung everyone. Sahib says that Brahma, Shivji, the
Sages, Sanak, Narad etc. also have not managed to escape
the spell of lust and lecherous desire. Sahib tells
Dharmadas, that it is only a rare few people who escapes
the clutches of lust with the power of true ‘Naam’ given
by Satguru in which they immerse themselves.

After cursing the three, Adya Shakti started repenting as
to why she cursed them all and why did she not forgive
them? In addition, wondered how Niranjan would react to
the same.
Niranjan speaks from the sky


Anuragsagar Vani 72

Speaking from the sky, Niranjan addressed Adyashakti as

that he had entruested her with the task of creation.
However, what character has she shown?
Adya also gets curse
Nich Hi Unch Sitay,
Badal Mohi So Pavai||
Dwapar Yug Jab Aay,

Niranjan said that in future, if a mighty one
troubles a weak one then he will give him sorrows and
cursed Adya that during Dwapar era the five husbands of
Draupadi (Gayatri) shall be the sons of Adya and they
shall be fatherless.

Adyashakti upon hearing Niranjan from the sky simply
stayed quiet and thought within herself that she has been
cursed in return for her having cursed Brahma, Gayatri,
and Puhupavati. She also thought that she subordinates
Kal Niranjan and she has to surrender to his will.

Pleased with Vishnu’s truthfulness, Adyashakti placed
him on her lap and told him that she will show him a
glimpse of his father. The mind is the force behind all
creation from which heaven, hell etc. been created. No
one can see the mind, which is formless or Nirakar and
that this Nirakar was is father adyashakti showed Vishnu
the mass of light in the space and told him to reverse his
breath to move up above his head into space and meditate.
Vishnu did as he was directed.

Vishnu could then see the mind who showed in the light
(jyoti). On seeing it, Vishnu was ecstatic. Then Vishnu
bowed his head to mother and said he was grateful, for she
showed him his father.

## 20. DHARMDASJI’S DOUBT

Dharmdas says
Dharmdas Gahi Teke Paya |
He Sahib Ik Sanshaya Aya ||
Kanya Mann Ko Dhyan Batava |
So Yah Sakal Jiv Bharamava||
Dharmdas held Sahibji’s feet and humbly said that he has
a doubt as to why Adyashakti showed Vishnu how to
meditate on the mind (Niranjan) who has kept all the jivas
in a state of illusion.
Sahibji’s replies –
Dharmdas Yah Kal Swabhau |
Purush Bhed Vishnu Nahin Pau ||
Kamini Ki Yah Dekhahu Baji|
Amrut Goy Diyo Vish Saji ||

Kaun Vipati Jivan Ki Kahaun |
Parakhi Vachan Nij Sahajahi Rahaun ||
Lakh Jiv Wah Nityahi Khai |
As Vikaral So Kal Kasai||
Sahibji clarifies to Dharmdas that it is the nature of the
Kal purush and that Vishnu did not gain any insight or
knowledge about Parampurush. Sahibji marvels at the
deceptive play of Adyashakti while imparting the
knowledge of the Kalpurush in the form of mind who is


75 Sahib Bandgi
highly vicious and poisonous to Vishnu, She very tactfully
withheld the knowledge about Parampurush, which is the
real nectar, or Amrut. Just as a moth, which is enchanted
and attracted to a burning flame and goes near the flame is
reduced to ashes out of ignorance, in the same way; the
Kalpurush in the form of brilliant light (Jyoti Nirangan)
also never spares anyone. Kal purush has eaten millions of
Vishnu Avatar (incarnate) and has swallowed many
Brahmas and shivas. It will be diffcult to imagine the sad
and pitiable plight of ordinary Jivas. He is a frightful
butcher who consumes one lakh jivas everyday.
Dharmdas asks again
Dharmadas Kaha Sunhu Gusai|

Ashtangihi Purush Uthpani |

Purush Bhed Nahin Sunat Batava |
Kal Niranjan Dhyan Karava||
Yah Kas Charit Kinha Ashtangi|
Taja Purush Bhai Kal Ki Sangi ||
Dharmdas expressed his doubt to Sahibji, that when
Parampurush had created Adyashakti and with the grace
of Parampurush alone she escaped any annhilation on
being swallowed by Kalpurush, how could she not revel to
Vishnu the secret about the power and kind grace of
Parampurush. Instead prompted people, to do Bhakti of
Kal Niranjan and meditate upon him, who is the
annihilator of jivas. Sacrificing Parampurush, She took the
side of Kalpurush.

of woman that as a daughter of the house she is loved and
pampered a lot, but when she marries and goes to her
husband’s house, she gets lost there and develops greater
love and affection towards her husband and house, forgets
all about her parent. Adyashakti did the same and she
became alien to her parent the Parampurush. This is
reason that she introduced Vishnu only to the deceitful
form of Kalpurush and not the true nectar of Param
purush.

## 21. VISHNUJI BECOMES THAKUR

Dharmdas asks
He Sahab Yah Janyo Bheda|
Ab Agey Ka Karahu Uchheda||
Dharmadas requests to sahib to narrate to him the later
facts and details about the world of Kalpurush.
Sahibji says
Puni Mata Kahi Vishnu Dulara |

Aho Vishnu Tum Lehu Asisa |

Pratham Putra Brahma Duri Gayau |
Akaram Jhuth Tahi Priya Bhayau||

Adyashakti blessed to Vishnuji and conferred the lordship
of all the angels (devatas) because Brahma, the eldest son
could not earn this merit as he had commited sins like
lying and misdeeds. Therefore, she said that all would
worship only Vishnu.
Rudr Pas Gayi Tab Mata |
Tum Shiv Kaho Hruday Ki Bata ||
Mangahu Jo Tumhare Chitt Bhave |
So Tohi Deun Math Pharamave ||
Then adyashakti asked Shivji as to what he would want
from her.
Jori Pani Shiv Kahabe Linha |
Dehu Janani Jo Agya Kinha||
Kabahun Na Binse Meri Dehi |
He Mata Mangon Bar Aihi ||
He Janani Yah Kijai Daya |

Shivaji begged that he might be granted immortal
body.

Adyashakti tells shiv that no one is immortal. She also
advised him to do Pawan Yog (pranayam) and told him
that he will live on as long as the earth, sky and the
universe exist.

Brahma was dejected and approached Vishnu and
said that the mother has been kind to you, but due to her
curses, he was in a pitiable condition. He said that Vishnu
is granted the fruit of his good deeds. Therefore, mother
cannot be faulted on that count. Therefore, he requested
Vishnu to find a way. Therefore, that the mother’s word
will not be violated and his progeny did not suffer.
Kahe Vishnu Chhodo Mann Bhanga|
Main Karihaun Seveakai Sanga||
Tum Tethe Ham Lahure Bhai|
Chitt Sanshaya Sab Dehu Bahai||

Vishnu tells Brahma that he is the elder brother while
he himself is the younger one. He said that he will serve
him and so he should not worry Vishnu said that
whenever his devotee, performs any religious ritual such
as Yagya, kirtan, charity he will have to do it only through
the priestly intervention of Brahma’s family. That is


79 Sahib Bandgi
anybody who performs auspicious and religious rituals
would have to do it as per the instructions of, who are the
progeny of Brahma.
Brahma Bhaye Anand,
Jabahi Vishnu As Bhaseu||
Meteu Chitt Kar Dwanda,

On hearing this, Brahma was relieved and his worries
ended. Since he realized that, his progeny can live happily
even if it is by deceitful means.

Sahib said that even when the same Jiv is present in all the
four categories of life, due to the different composition of
```

81 Sahib Bandgi
elements, there would be difference in knowledge and
awareness. In the Asthavar khani, the living beings are
composed of a single element. In the Ukamaj catagory,
there are two elements. In the Andaj category, there are
three elements. In the Pindaj categoey, there are four
elements and the human species there are all the five
elements. Due to this reason, human beings have the most
knowledge and awareness, which is conducive to devotion
and meditation.
Dharmadas asks again

different elements comprised in each of the four
categories.
Sahib replies
Khaani Andaj Tin Tatva Hain, Ap Vayu Aru Tej Ho|
Achal Khani Ek Tatvahi, Tatva Jalka Theg Ho||
Sahib said that Andaj category is comprised of thri
elements Naamely water, air and fire.
On the other hand, the Asthavar category is comprised of
only one element Naamely water.
Ushamaj Tat Hain Doy, Vayu Tej Sam Janiye|
Pindaj Charahin Soy, Pruthvi Tej Ap Vayu Sam||
The Ukamaj category has two elements of Air and Fire
while the Pindaj has four elements Namely Earth, Water,
Fire, and Air.

attain Amarlok.

Sahib says that he who comes into the human body from
the Andaj category will always be very slipy and have
high degree of lust and anger. They are very poor, engage
in theft, sneaking, criticizing others, and create fights in
other’s home, arguing with everyone but lack in
knowledge, meditation etc. These people cannot identify
Gurus and Satgurus and are ignorant about the Vedas and
shastras and though they are insignificant, they think very
highly of themselves. They wear soiled clothes with
discharge emanating from their eyes and drool from their

People who came from Ukamaj khani are fond of
hunting. They hunt and with a lot of effort cook it and eat.
They criticize the Guru and the ‘Naam’ and are habitual
lyers, wear tilled turbans and have a long tail from their
turbans. They are cruel, lack in kindness and
righteousness, and poke fun at people who engage in good
deeds. They wear tilak and sandal paste on their forehead
and flaunt the same. They are hypocrites, cruel but pretend
to be of soft nature. They have long teeth and freeghtful
body with bulging eyes.

Human beings born after being in Asthavar category of
life has an unstable mind, their decision keep changing,
they wear turbans, serve in the government, covet other’s
wives, and keep signaling them to come, speak in
provocative and lustful manner. They stealthily enter
other’s houses and if caught are unbashed, they keep
laughing. They are erratic in worshiping their God. They,
may at one point be reading the scriptures and the very
next moment will seize chance to dance in other’s houses.
They may act as brave warriors at one time and then
immediately run away like cowards. They will at one
point be doing good deeds and the very next moment the
sinful acts.While eating they may scratch their head, rub
their arms and thighs, sleep soon after eating food and if
any one tries to wake them up, they would chase and beat
them, they have red eyes and they are ever more
mysterious.

People who had died early before completing their age,
they are brave people, they fear nothing, they are free
from affection, attachment etc. Their enemies fear them
they honour truthful words and do not criticize others.
They are devoted to their Guru and instantly recognise
true ‘Naam’. Such people come into the human form to
fulfil their short-lived life in their previous birth.

### 26 Why 84 lakh species created........................

Dharmadas asks
Chaurasi Yonin Ki Dhara|
Kih Karan Yah Kinha Pasara||
Nar Karan Yah Srushti Banai|
Ke Koi Aur Jiv Bhugatai||
Dharmadas asks Sahib that, if this creation of the worlds
is for Human Beings, than why were other species created.
What was the need for creating 84 lakh species of life?
Sahib replies
Dharmani Nar Dehi Sukhadayi|
Nar Dehi Guru Gyan Samayi||
Nar Tanu Kaj Kinha Chaurasi|
Shabd Na Gahe Mudh Mati Nashi||
Chaurasi Ki Chal Na Chhade|

Parachai Gyan Jahan Kachhu Nahin||
Puni Puni Dhaud Kal Mukh Jahi|
Tahi Te Jiv Chetat Nahi||
Yah Tan Pay Gahe Satanaama|
Naam Pratap Lahe Nijadhama||
Sahib tells Dharmadas that this human form is
full of joy and it can really absorb the knowledge given by


Anuragsagar Vani 88
the Satguru. Actually, it is because of the human form that
84 lakh species of life were created, to confuse and
confound the Human Beings so that they cannot recognise
the true world. Human being’s (Hansas) wisdom and
awareness significantly reduces, after passing through 84
lakh species of life forms and their tendencies. If the
Jivatma is put into the human form directly, he will
become aware and engage in the devotion of the
Parampurush and the business of worldly life (Sansar)
would be hampered. Therefore, he is passed through 84
lakh species where there is no real knowledge and self-
realization cannot be obtained. Thus, Jivatma repeatedly
goes into the mouth of Kal Purush to lose all his
knowledge and awareness. If Human Beings catch the true
‘Naam’ they will reach Amarlok.
Nih Achhar Hai Saar, Achhar Te Lakhi Pavai||
Dharmni Karo Vichar, Nih Achhar Nih Tatva Hai||
Sahib then tells Dharmadas that the Sar Shabd/Tatva is not
the written or spoken word and it does not contain any of
the elements therefore it is a soundless sound.

Anuragsagar Vani 90
Sahib tells Dharmadas the scheme and play of Kalpurush
could not be deciphered by the Pandit and Kazis.
Adyashakti and Tridevas created the world and given the
Jivas with the ever-perishable colour of the mortal body.
She packed 5 elements, three gunas, 14 Yamas with the
innocent Jiva. The 14 Yamas were placed to mislead the
Jiva. Thus, human body was constructed and created,
humans repeatedly suffer in this Mortal World. Even the
Vedas speak about the ‘Onkar’, which is the causative
factor that confuses and misguides the world. Onkar is
nothing but Niranjan or Nirakar himself (The form less
Lord). The information and existence of Parampurush is
hidden from the world. Kal Purush expanded his creation
and spread to such an extent that 88 thousand Brahmas
were created with life forms, confused everyone in the
web of Shastras and Vedas and force everyone to worship
and meditate on Niranjan. As per the sant Matt; All, the
Jivas were confounded and confused without the
knowledge about Parampurush. Sahib tells Dharmadas
that all this was wicked design of Niranjan.
Asur Hai Jiv Satavai, Dev Rushi Muni Karank|
Puni Dhari Avatar Rakshak, Asur Karat Swaharakam||
Jiv Ko Dikhalay Lila, Apani Mahima Ghani|
Yahi Jan Jiv Bandh Asa, Yahi Hai Rakshak Dhani||
Rakshak Kala Dikhal Kar, Anth Kal Bhakshan Karai|
Pichhe Jiv Pachhitay Bahut, Jab Kal Ke Mukh Men Pare||
Niranjan comes in the form of Asuras and torture Jivas,
Rishi Muni etc. Then the same Niranjan again incarnates
as an Avatar, pretends to be the savior, and kills the
demons in this way Niranjan cheats Jivas by enacting play
and makes the Jivas believe of his power and protection
and the Jivas naively believe him to be the protector. In
the pretence of being a protector in the end, he devours the
Jivatmas this is when the Jivatma repents about having
naively trusted Niranjan.

Jivas from him as he has permeated and resided in every
one in the form of the mind. He also tired to discourage
Sahib by saying that he has posted 360 power centers in
the world where he has placed his various powers and
where he presides. All Jivas are entangled in worshiping
Niranjan. He says that he has weakened the Jivas by with
lust, anger; greed etc. and the Jivas are in an awful state.
He also says that he has bound the Jivas in the mesh of
good deeds and bad deeds (Punya and Pap). Therefore,

Sahib tells Niranjan that he would administer the Naam of
the Parampurush to the Jivas,.Then the Yama(Angel of
Death) will be powerless, even if Niranjan presides over
his several power centres and enchants the Jivas , with the


Anuragsagar Vani 96
power of this Naam Jivas will be released andthe Naam
will also carry them to Amarlok.
Niranjan says
Ka Gyani Deho Adhikari|
Humro Nahi Chutey Yam Jara||
Panch Pachis Tin Gun Ahi|

Mann Baitha Le Hamari Phansa||
Jahan Tahan Jag Bharamavai|
Gyan Sandhi Kachhu Rahan Na Pavai||
Ek Shabd Ki Kaitak Asha|
Mere Hain Chaurasi Phansa||
Niranjan again says to Sahib that he just cannot free the
Jivas from his clutches as he has created the body of the
Jiva with five elements. Than captured them in the mesh
of bad deeds and good deeds (Pap and punya), that in the
form of the mind, he permeates everyone and just does not
let anyone think for themselves, decipher the puzzling
code of his creation. What will one word (Naam) of
Parampurusha do as he has trapped the Jivas in 84 lakh
species of life?
Sahib replies
Bole Gyani Shabd Vichari|
Chhute Chaurasi Ki Dhari||
Chhute Panch Pachhis Gun Tinon|
Aisa Shabd Purush Main Dinhon||
Sahib warns Niranjan that the Naam of the Parampurush
that he possesses is a powerful one and Niranjan can not
violate this Naam in the least, whenever Sahib administer
the same to any Jiva, he will surely escape the noose of
Kal.
Niranjan says

Karam Rekh Bandhai Sab Sadha|
Sur Nar Muni Sakalo Jag Bandha||
Niranjan asks Sahibh, have you ever seen even a single
Jiva go to satlok away from his clutches in the past many
Eras. He says it is so because he has bound the Jivas with
great force and will not let them go and that Sahib or his
Naam cannot do anything if Niranjan destroys and
dissolves the Trilokas. Niranjan has many times dissolved
the universal creation. Such deeds cannot be that of Sahib
or Parampurush.
Then Sahib States, no one knows the protector
Parampurush but everyone contemplates on the destroyer,
Niranjan. Further boasts that he has bound all the Jivas
with the enchanting bond of Pap and Poonya. He says that
let alone an ordinary man, even the demons ,Devatas
,Rishis Munis ,humanbeings and the whole world has
been bound by him and he will not let a single Jiva pass
out of his clutches.
Sahib says
Gyani Kahain Kal Anyayi|
Shabd Bina Tu Khay Chabai||
Ab Tum Kas Khaiho Batasar|
Purush Bhashon Vishvasa||
Subh Aru Asubh Ka Kare Nibera|
Meto Kal Sakal urajhera||
Sahib tells Niranjan that this is precisely why he has come
now. Since in the last many Eras, he has not let any Jiva to
go to Satyalok. Sahib says that earlier the Jivas did not
have the true power of true Naam of Parampurush and
they were only trying to escape to Amarlok with their own
efforts and that Kal ate them up. Now Sahib says that he


Anuragsagar Vani 98
would give the tremendously potent Naam of the
Parampurush and that Niranjan cannot do anything to
resist the same. The Naam would give the Jiva a lot of
self-confidence and the awareness of good and bad will
sprout within the Jivas. Absolute protection will also be
provided to the Jivas by a Naam and all vicious bonds of
Kal will be broken and the Jiva will go to Amarlok Sahib
as elsewhere also stated, “Sumiran pay satya jo vira, Sang
rahun main das kabira “
Niranjan says
Niragun Kal Tab Bole Bani|

Ai Sab Kahiye Jam Sahidani||
Niranjan now says that he has also bound the Jiva with
vices of lust, anger, etc. These will not let the Jivas go to
the abode of the Parampurush. Again, the fourtin
messengers of Yama, are installed in human body and that
one cannot throw them away. Niranjan says that of the
fourtin Yamas, one induces slip, the second induces lust
and desire, the third one induces enjoyment. The next
Yama disturbs Concentration, he is Named Chittbhagha,
and so on there are fourtin messengers of Yama who
enchant and confuse the Jiva all the time along with lust,


99 Sahib Bandgi
anger. The Jiva is so badly corrupted that no Jiva would
accept the Naam of Parapurush.
Sahib replies

Kya Re Kal Tum Karo Badhai||
Unmey Yam Ka Parai Na Chhahin |

Sahib replies that in whichever body the Naam of
Parampurush is given. Niranjan cannot overpower him or
her, no lust or anger can come near him, such Jiva will be
purified, Niranjan would be helpless, and such Jiva will
assume a swan like state and go back to his abode that is
the Amarlok.
Niranjan says
Kahe Niranjan Sun Ho Gyani|
Kathi Ha Jan Tumhari Bani||
Yugat Mahatma Sabai Bataun|
Tumhara Naam Le Panth Chalaun||
Now Niranjan resorted to his deceitful nature and said that
he will start Cult in the Name of sahib and puzzle the
Jivas even more. No one would know the truth. He said
that he would administer his own Naam fraudulantly in
the Naame of Sahib. This is how the Jivas in today’s
world are in a puzzled state and not in a position to know
which is real true Naam of Parampurush and who would
administers it?
Sahib replies

Niranjan argues that he also has entrenched such
superstition amongst the Jivas (such as Sutak, Patak
Karmakand, Religious Rituals etc.) in which the Jivas
have blind faith and that no one would listen to Sahib and
therefore he should refrain from stepping into the world.
Sahib says

Sahib says that all the superstition of one who takes the
true Naam from Sahib will be washed away and even Kal
cannot go near him. The Naam will also protect such a
Jiva.

Pavai Shabd Hoy Abhimani| Kaise Lok Jahin Prani||

Niranjan says that the web of illusion and enchantment
that he has woven into the body of Jiva can never be
cleansed, Jiva will never understand. Even if Sahib gives
the Naam of Parampurush to Jiva, he will be adamant and
cannot abide by your rules and therefore, such a Jiva can
never be liberated
Sahib says

Sahib says that, whoever gets the Naam of
Parampurush and devoted to him, will give up lust, anger,
etc. reject the world of Niranjan and attain the court of
Parampurush.
Niranjan says

Niranjan arrogantly tells Sahib that no one has escaped his
noose, as it is formed with strong chain of karma (deeds).
It has bound the whole universe, including the Rishis,
Munis, Sidhdas, Sadhus, Devatas (acclaimed people) and
even the Tridev (3 Gods), who are caught in the web of
karma and have beeneaten up by him and that no one is
free from Karma.
Sahib replies
Kahai Gyani Sun Kal Labara|
Karihaun Tuk Janjir Tumhara||
Hansan Laihon Turat Ubari|
Purush Shabd Dinhon Mohi Bhari||
Sahib tells the fraudulent Niranjan that he will break and
destroy his chain of Karma with powerful Naam of the
Parampurush and the Jivas would be free.

Now Niranjan became furious and started threatening
Sahib. He says that after great service of Parampurush he
has earned the lordship of Triloks and the eight-armed
Adyashakti. He said that Sahib then ousted him from Man
Sarovar and therefore, now he would avenge him and not
pardon him. Niranjan then assumed the form of a
humongous elephant with enormous trunk and tusks,
charged at Sahib, and tried to intimidate and dare him.
Gyani Purush Shabd Kiyo Jora|Paked Sundh Danta Gahi

Mareu Sabd Pav Kar Peli| Tor Sundh Samudra Gahi Meli||

Sahib now assumed his real form of Parampurush and
focussed his concentration on Niranjan, broke his tusk,
held him by his trunk and flung him into the sea.

Now Niranjan came into his senses, surrendered to
Sahib, and with folded hands said that he siks refuge in
Sahib. He said that Sahib himself is the Satapurush, but he
was under the wrong impression that he is his brother, and
therefore fought him, not having recognized him Niranjan
had used his strength and brain against him. Therefore, he


Anuragsagar Vani 104
sought forgiveness of Sahib. He also said that he was very
fortunate that he could have his darshan that day.
Sahib replies
Sunare Kal Niranjan Rai|
Purush Naam Jo Vira Pai||
Tako Khunt Goho Mat Lai|
So Hansa Mere Lokhi Aai||
Sahib warns Niranjan that he shall not stop anyone upon
whom Sahib bestows the Naam and such Jiva will go to
his eternal land of Amarlok.
Niranjan asks
Suno Gusai Vinati Mori|
Naam Pay Karai Kachhu Auri||
Gyan Kathai Anant Chith Vasa|
Avagaman Ki Rakhe Asa||
Niranjan enquires what happen of the Jivas who will not
follow the rule and desire rebirth even after getting the
Naam of Parampurush from Sahib, will they escape his
clutches.
Sahib replies
Suno Niranjan Bachan Hamara|
Nahin Satta Wah Jiv Tumhara||
Sahib agreed that in such case, Jivas will belong to
Niranjan and he can take them away.
Niranjan said
Dayavant Tum Sahib Datha|

105 Sahib Bandgi
Niranjan requests Sahib that he should free many Jivas
from the world of Niranjan only during Kaliyug and sure
only a few Jivas during Satyayug, Dwaparyug and
Tretayug so that he can abide by the curse of Parampurush
that he devours one lakh Jivas everyday.
Sahib replies

Sahib told Niranjan that he has asked him to allow him to
subject Jivas to manipulation and deceit during the first
thri Eras, but since he is now praying, he is forgiving him,
but when Kaliyug comes, he will send a messenger from
his essence.
Ansh Byalis Purush Ke,

Kali Panth Pragat Pasari Ke,

Sahib said that 42 messengers from the essence of
Parampurush will appear for the welfare and benefit of
Jivas and they will establish their Cult and takes the Jivas
to Amarlok.
Niranjan says
Vachan Tumhar Linha Main Mani|

Niranjan says that he agris with what Sahib said, but
requests that he will be allowed to establish twelve of his
own cults, as against one of Sahibji’s cult, so as to puzzle
and confuse the Jivas with the help of twelve Yamas that
he will set upon the world. They would then in your Name
run my cults. Whoever joins my 12 cults will land up in
my mouth and I will devour them.

Sahib says

Sahib responded that he has sin through Niranjan’s deceit
and what he desired. He said that Niranjan wanted to
pollute the nectar of Parampurush with the poison from 12
Yamas running Niranjan’s cults. Sahib warned NIranjan
that if he resorted to any deceitful act he would destroy
him and take away all the Jivas to Amarlok. He regretted
that he does not have such order from Parampurush and so
he would only take such Jivas who with firm
determination stick by the Naam of the Parampurush.
Niranjan says

Sahib came to the burning hot rocks where Nirtanjan was
torturing the Jivas by roasting and devouring them. On
seeing Sahib, the Jivas called out to Sahib to save them.
Sahib then uttered the true Naam. The burning hot rocks
suddenly cooled down and the Jivas were relieved.
Sakal Jiv Tab Astuti Laye|
Dhanya Purush Bhal Tapan Bhujhaye||

All the Jivas then collectively prayed Sahib to get them
the release.

Anuragsagar Vani 108
Jab Tum Deh Dharo Jag Jayi|Bisarayo Purush Kal Dhari

Sahib then told the Jivas that if he forcibly get them
release and take them to Amarlok, then his word of
promise to Niranjan might be violated. He told the Jivas
that when they get the human body, they should aspire to
get the true Naam and when they get the Naam, they
would go to Satalok. Then Sahib said that wherever there
is longing for him he will reseede there, Sahib also told
the Jevas that they have forgotton Parampurush that is
why Kalpurush was eating them up.
The jivas said;
Kahe Jiv Sun Purush Purana|
Deh Dhari Visarayo Yah Gyana||
Purush Jan Samareu Yamarai|
Ved Puran Kahe Samujhai||
Ved Puran Kahe Mat Eha|
Nirakar Te Kije Neha||

The Jivas told Sahib that even after going to human body
they did not have any knowledge. They had forgotten our
Parampurush, mistook Kal himself to be Parampurush.
Worshipped him believing the world of Vedas and
Puranas, which prescribed the devotion of Nirakar
Niranjan. Even all sur, nar (humans) munis, and 33 crores
Devatas worshipped Niranjan and are devoted to him.
Sahib said
Suno Jiv Yah Chhal Yam Kaira|
Yah Yam Phanda Kinha Ghanera||
Sahib says that in order to cheat the Jivas, Kal and Maya
have spread the deceitful web.
Kal Kanya Anek Kinhe, Jiv Karan Jal Ho||

Deh Dhari Nar Pargat Ho,Phiri Tahi Asha Kinheu||

109 Sahib Bandgi
In order to cheat the Jivas Kal and Maya have created the
deceitful web at the Pilgrim Centres, Yog, Yagya, Tapas
(penance) etc. have laid many nooses and no one is
finding the true path to salvation. In the human body the
Jiva aspires for benediction from Kal that is why he (Jiva)
is roaming hither and thither engaging in good deeds in
the hope of attaining Heaven.

Jivas (Mankind)

Sahib told Dharmadas that he utters the same word that
the Parampurush has uttered to him and told him that with
the word he would awaken the Jivas and bring them to
Satalok. This is a secret thing; he has given which is a
bodiless “Naam” in which without the mouth the
soundless sound is uttered.
With Gurukrupa, only some rare people can earn this
“Naam”. He who faithfully holds on to this Naam will
have his seventyone generation before him will be
liberated. With the thread of this Naam, the Jivas climb to
Satlok and even the Kal fears such a Jiva.

Sahib says that one should hold in the vault of his heart
the word of the guru after taking the nectar of the
“Naam.One (person who takes the Naam) should always
concentrated (Guru Muk) on the guru like the devoted
love of chakor bird for the moon. One should be devoted
to his guru. Just like devoted wife who never ever even in
her dream thinks about going to another man. One
should always abide by the command of the Guru. Think
of The Guru as supreme and banish all webs of
enchantment and always remember the form of the Guru
and meditate upon him.One should not engage in visiting
pilgrimage centre or worship of gods like the worldly
people.
Guru Bakti Atal Aman Dharmani,

Sahib says that devotion to Guru is a complete devotion,
which cannot be equaled by any other kind of devotion.
Chanting (Jap) Yog, Tap (Penance) Vrat (Fasting) Dan

devotion of one’s Guru.

The great Yogi Shukhdev had no Guru and his devotion
was futile, as he could not reach his goal. Vishnu sent
him back by saying that he does not accept people who do
not have Gurus and Shukhdev made King Janak his Guru
and there after Vishnu accepted him. Narad, the son of
Brahma was so proud that he thought he did not nid a
Guru.Vishnu has asked him to surrender to a Guru as the
legend goes only when one comes to a true Guru, he will
find the right path. He who can impart the message of the
Parampurush alone can be a true Guru and no one else.
Only such Guru can free us, from the cycle of birth and
death and carry us to Amarlok. Sahib tells Dharmadas like
Bhrunga (bumblebee) who transforms other insects into
his own form; a true Guru can make his disciples
completely like himself.

On Dharmadasji enquiry Sahib narrated his story of how
he appeared in his world during each Era. First Sahib says
that he appeared during Satayug.

Sahib says that during Satayug first he came to Brahmaji
and spoke to him about Parampurush. Brahma started
listening attentively and asked him more details about
Parampurush when Niranjan felt that his oldest son
Brahma was slipping out of his grip and he immediately
intervened in Brahma’s mind and distracted and diverted
his mind
Brahma says
Nirakar Nirgun Avinashi|Jyoti Swarup Shunya Ka Vasi||
Tahi Purush Kahan Ved Bakhane|Agya Ved Tahi Ham Jane||
Brahma immediately started telling Sahib that he learnt
from the Vedas that Parmatma is formless-Nirgun-Nirakar
and manifest in the form of the Brilliant Light (Jyoti) and
that he resides in the Shunya.
Jab Dekha Tehi Kal Bhatakao|
Tahan Te Uth Vishnu Pahan Ayo||
Vishnu Hi Kahya Purush Upadesho|
Kalvash Nahin Gaho Sandesho||
Sahib realized that Kalpurush diverted Brahma’s mind and
he came to Vishnu and told him of the secret about


Anuragsagar Vani 114
Parampurush and due to the intervention of Kal, he also
could not get message from Sahib.
Vishnu says
Kahe Vishnu Mosam Ko Ahi|
Char Padarath Hamare Pahi||
Kam Moksha Dharmarath Mahil|
Chahe Jaun Deu Main Tahi||
Vishnuji boasted that there is no one who will be equal to
him as he has all the four virtues of manhood Naamely
Dharma, Artha, Kam, Moksh and that he could give
Sahibji anything that he wanted.
Sahib replies
Sunahu So Vishnu Moksha Kastohi|
Moksh Akshar Parale Tar Hoi||
Tum Nahi Thir Thir Kas Karahu|
Mithya Sakhi Kavan Gun Bharahu||
Rahe Sakuch Sun Nirabhay Bani|
Nij Hiya Vishnu Ap Dar Mani||
Then Sahib told him that the Moksh or Salvation that
Vishnu give, would only last until dissolution (Pralay) and
that he himself would not survive after that, and therefore
he could not grant lasting Salvation to anyone. Vishnu
was dumb on hearing this.
Tab Puni Nag Lok Chali Gayau|
Tase Kachu-Kachu Kahibe Layau||
Purush Bhed Koi Janat Nahin|
Lage Sabahin Kal Ki Chhahi||
Rakhan Har Kahan Chinho Bhai|

Sahib says that he then went to Naglok (world of snakes)
and bit by bit, he started narrating about Parampurush and
told that no one knows about him since everyone was only
following Kal purush. Sahib asked Nagas (cobras) to
recognize the savior who could save them from Yama, the
god of death.
Brahma, Vishnu Rudra Jihi Dhyavain|

Sheshag naively said that Niranjan alone is a savior who
will save him from Yamraj as even brahma; Vishnu and
Shiva meditate upon Niranjan whose praises. Even the
Vedas sing day and night, Yamraj could not do anything
Jahi Kahahu Tum Rakhanhara|So Tumhin Lai Karahi Ahara||
Rakhanhar Aur Kau Ahi|Karu Vishwas Milnau Tahi||
Sahib told Sheshnag that the one who he believed to be a
Savior, would one day devour him and the real Savior was
someone else and that if he trusted Sahibji he would
introduce Sheshnag to Param purush.

Tab Aayo Main Ya Bavsagar||
Aye Jab Mrutyu Mandal Mahi|

So To Adhik Yam Ko Besha||
Sahib told Dharmdas that due to the poisonous nature of
Sheshnag, he could never believe him and therefore, Sahib
straight away came to the earth. In addition, when he
came here, he did not find even a single Jiv who would be
engaged in the devotion to Parampurush could take the
message of Parampurush as all had assumed the form of
Kalpurush.
Main Aya Sansar Mey, Fira Gav Ki Chhor|
Aisa Banda Na Mila, Jo Lijai Fatak Pachhor||
Sahib went to every town, village and strit, but could not
find anyone who could understand, what he said after
spending a hundred years on this earth, Sahib returned to
Satlok, as no one would believe him then Parampurush
gave him a secret thing (vastu) and told him that he could
give this to Jivas (mankind).

## 37 Secret behind Ram Naam............................1

Sahib says
Brahma Vishnu Shiv Sanakadi|

Kawan Naam Sumiro Karatara|
Kawan Naam Dhyan Anusara||
Sabahi Shunya Maha Dhyan Lagaye|

Ma Akshar Maya Sanchara||
Dou Akshar Kaha Sam Kai Rakha|
Ram Naam Sabhin Abhilakha||
Ram Naam Lai Jagahi Drudhayo|
Kal Fand Koi Chinha Na Payo||
Sahib tells Dharmadas that in the beginning of the creation
Brahma, Vishnu, Shivaji and Sanak met and debated as to
what is the Naame of the Paramatma that they should
chant or meditate upon. Then all of them started
meditating in a motion less and breathless state (Samadhi)
in the Space; when Niranjan uttered Rarankar and Maya
uttered the word “Ma”. both these words were joined and
the word “Rama” was formed and chosen, from then
everyone started chanting Ram Naam but no one could
understand the mystery of Kal and his treacherous nooses.
In this way, the word “Ram” denotes both Niranjan and
maya, which is not the true Naam of Parampurush.

117 Sahib Bandgi
Sahib tells Dharmadas that he would now narrate to him
the Naames of Jivas to whom he gave the true Naam first
Sahib told King Dhondal about the secret of true Naam,
which he believed and so sahib gave him true Naam.
Dhondal Shabd Chitay,Tab Ayau Mathura Nagar|
Khemasari Ayo Dhay,Nari Vrudh Govali So||
After awakening King Dhondhal with the true Naam,
Sahib came to Mathura where lived the old Milkmaid
Khemasari who on seeing Sahib came running to him.
Kahe Khemasari Purush Purana|
Kahawa Te Tum Kinha Payana||
Tason Kaheu Shabd Upadesha|
Purush Bhav Aru Yamako Besha||
Khemsari with amusement asked Sahib, where he came
from and doubting his stories of Parampurush and
Kalpurush.
Pai Dhokha Ik Tahi Rahai|
Dekhe Lok Tab Mann Patiyai||
Rakheu Deh Hans Lai Dhava|
Pal Ik Mahi Lok Pahunchava||
Lok Dikhay Hans Lai Aayo|
Deh Paay Khemsari Pachhatayo||
He Sahib Lai Chalu Vahi Desha|
Yahan Bahut Hai Kal Kalesha||
Khemsari was in some doubt so Sahib took her to
Amarlok and cleared her doubt and she trusted now.On
returning from Amarlok she begged that Sahib to take her
back to Amarlok saying that the world is full of misery.
Tasaun Kahau Suno Yah Bani|
Jo Me Kabhun Lehu So Mani||
Jabloan Thika Pur Na Aai|
Tab Lag Raho Naam Lau Lai||
Tum To Dekha Lok Hamara|

So Kapilahi Kou Aai Chhudayi||
Ta Narako Sab Suyash Bakhane|
Gau Chhuday Bag Te Ane||
Ek Jiv Jo Bhakti Drudhave|
So Kotik Gau Punya So Pave||
Sahib then told Khemsari that she should contemplate on
the Naam of the Parampurush until she completes her life.
He told her that since she has actually sin Amarlok. She
should convince others to take to true Bhakti. He also told
her that if she can bring even one Jiv to surrender to a
Naam She would please Parampurush immensely. Just as
when an innocent cow go near the jaws of a lion and
another one saves it from the lion, then everyone praises
the saviour of the cow. Similarly when one Jiv is made to
change from Kalpurush‘s Bhakti to Satyapurush‘s Bhakti,
it will be equivalent to save millions of cows.
Khemasari Parai Charan Par Ayi|
He Sahib Mohi Lehu Bachayi||
Mo Par Daya Karahu Prakasha|

Khemsari fell at Sahib’s feet and prayed that she should
be saved from Kal.
Sun Khemasari Yaha Yam Ko Desha|
Bina Naam Nahin Mitai Andesha||
Purush Naam Bira Jo Pave|
Firakai Bhav Sagar Nahin Ave||
Sahib told Khemsari that, in this land of Kal without true
Naam, doubts would not be eradicated. In addition,
whoever receives the secret Naam of Parampurush will
not return in the hands of Kal.
Kahe Khemsari Paavana Dijai|
Yam So Chhori Apan Kari Lijai||
Aur Jiv Hamare Gruha Ahi|
Naam Pan Prabhu Dijai Tahi||
Khemasari requests Sahib that He should now give the
ticket of Naam to Amarlok, release from Yama and take

her. Request to give this true Naam to the other Jivas in
her house. Then Sahib went to her house and gave true
Naam to all, showed them the procedure of doing Arati
(Prayer) In Satyayug Sahib sent four Hansas into
Amarlok.

## 39 Sahibji’s arrival in Treta yug........................

After Satyayug Sahib appeared in Tretayug and became
famous in the world by the Naame, Munindraji when
Sahib started giving spiritual message and the true Naam
to the Jivas. Niranjan grew suspicious that he is destroying
his world by taking all Hansas (Jivas) to Parampursh.

At the dawn of Tretayug Sahib again come to this mortal
world and started asking many as to who would save them
from Kalpurush? Some said Vishnu, some said Shivaji
and some said Chandidevi. Due to the illusion and
enchantment and by the designs of Kalpurush, people
were worshipping the above Gods and without realizing
```

Anuragsagar Vani 120
the truth that they were all walking into the jaws of
Kalpurush.
Chahun Dishi Phiri Ayeun Gadh Lanka|

Sumiran Dhyan Tahiso Bhakha|
Purush Dor Goy Nahi Rakha||
After touring in all the directions, Sahib came to Lanka
and met a Brahmin called Vichitra who understood the
message of Sahib and he surrendered and fell at his feet
and prayed him to take care of his soul. Sahib then gave
him the true Naam and showed him like Khemsari how to
do the Arti, meditation and chanting of the true Naam.
Then the wife of Vichitra met to the Queen Mandodari of
Lanka and told her about Sahib, She praised his
appearance and said that she has never met such a Sadhu
before. Upon hearing this Mandodari rushed to si Sahib
and she was amazed.
Kahe Mandodari Dhub Din Mora|
Vinati Karon Doi Kar Jora||
Aisa Tapasi Kabahun Na Dekha|
Shwet Anga Sab Shwethi Bhekha||
He Samarath Mohi Karahu Sanatha|

Mandodari requested Sahib to give her true Naam and
save her from drowning in this wordly ocean of Kal.
Sunahu Vadhu Priya Ravan Keri|

Sahib told Mandodari that only with the power of true
Naam one can escape from the bonds of Yamraj. Sahibji
told her about the distinction betwin the good and the bad
and that she could distinguish the same with her inner
eyes. He told Mandodari that Sathyapurush is different
from Thrilok (3 Lokas) and he who remember Sahib’s
Naam will escape from the circle of birth and death.
Sunatahi Shabd Tasu Bhram Bhaga|
Gahyo Shabd Shuchi Mann Anuraga||
He Sahib Mohi Lije Sharana|
Metahu Mor Janm Aru Marna||
Dinhon Tahi Pan Paravana|

On listening Sahib all the doubts and illusions of
Mandodari vanished, her heart became clear, and filled
with love. She prayed to Sahib to free her from the cycle
of birth and death by giving refuge to her. Now Sahib
gave her true Naam.
Tab Main Ravan Paha Chali Aao|
Dwarpal So Vachan Sunayo||
Toso Ek Bat Samujhai|
Raja Kaha Tum Av Livai||
Sahib then reached the palace of King Ravana and sent
messege through Sentry that one Sadhu has come at the
door of his palace and he should come and lead him in.
The sentry (dwarpal) says
Dwarpal Tab Vinati Lai|Maha Prachanda Hai Ravan Rai||
Mahagarva Aru Krodh Apara| Kaho Jay Mohi Pal Mey Mara||


Anuragsagar Vani 122
The Sentry said that Ravana is very proud, powerful,
angry and terrible man and that if he carried this message
to him, Ravana would kill him.
SAHIB SAYS
Manahu Vachan Jav Yahi Bara|
Rom Bank Nahi Hoy Tumhara||
Satya Vachan Tum Hamara Mano|
Ravan Jay Turat Tum Ano||
Sahib assured the Sentry that no harm will come to him.
He should believe his words and immediately give his
message to Ravana.
Tatkshan Ga Pratihar Janayi|Dwai Kar Jore Thadh Rahai||
Siddha Ek To Ham Paha Ai|Tekah Rajahi Lav Bulai||
The sentry then went into the palace and with folded
hands told Ravana that there is Sadhu at the palace gate
and he wants to si you.
Sun Nrup Krodh Kenha Tehi Bara|
Main Matihen Ahi Pratihara||
Yahimati Gyan Haron Kin Tora|
Jo Tain Mohi Bulavan Daura||
Darsh Mor Shivsut Nahin Pavat|
Mon Kah Bhiksuk Kaha Bulavat||
Ravana suddenly grew angry and asked Sentry whether he
was out of his senses that he has come to call him. Ravana
arrogantly said that even the son of Shivaji could not see
him and how he could then come and tell him that a
beggar wants to see him.
Ravan Chala Shastra Le Hatha| Turat Jay Tihi Katon Matha||
Maron Tahi Sis Khasi Paraye|Dekhon Bhuksuk Mor Ka

Jahan Munindra Tahan Ravan Rai| Sattar Bar Astra Kar Lai||
Lenha Munindra Trun Kar Ota|Ati Bal Ravan Marai Chota||
Ravana grew very furious and with the sword in his hand,
thought that he will cut off his head and si to what he
would do to him. Ravana come and swished his sword at
Sahib 70 times but Sahib would stop his sword with a


123 Sahib Bandgi
blade of grass every time. Ravana is powerful warrior but
nothing happens to Sahib.
Trun Oth Yahi Karane Hai,Garva Dhari Ray Ho||
Tehi Karane Yah Yukti Kinhi, Laj Ravan Aay Ho||
Sahib used a blade of grass to prick the arrogance and
pride of Ravana and put him to shame.
Ravan Ko Aman Kari, Tab Avadh Nagarahi Aye|
Dasha Sant Ki Jan Ke, Madhukar Pakarai Paye||
After breaking the pride and arrogance of Ravana, Sahib
came to Avadh and met the Brahmin Madhukar who fil at
his feet and surrendered.
Dekhyo Tahi Bahut Lavlina|Tason Kahyo Gyan Ko Chinha||
Purush Sandesh Kaheu Tihin Pasa|Sunat Bachan Jiya Bhayau
Hulasa||
Sahibji was touched by Madhukar’s love and gave him
knowledge about Parampurush. On hearing this he was
very pleased.
Ambu Milat Ankar Sukh Mana|
Taisahi Madhukar Sabdahi Jana||
Purush Bhav Sun Tehi Harashanta|
Mokaha Lok Dikhavahu Santa||
On hearing Sahibji’s words, Madhukar was overjoyed
just as a sid sprouts when it gets water as if to express joy
so He begged Sahib to show him his Amarlok.
Rakhyo Deh Hansa Lai Dhaye |
Amar Lok Lai Tihin Pahunchaye||
Sobha Lok Dekh Harashana|
Tab Madhukar Ko Mann Patiyana||
Then Sahib took Madhukar’s Atma out of his body and
took him to Amarlok. On seeing the grandeur of Amarlok,
he was even more pleased and convinced.
Apart from Madhukar, Sahib gave salvation to
Shrungirishi, Vashistrishi etc, and total seven Jivas.

In Dwaparyug Parampurush again summoned Sahib,
asked him to go to the mortal world and save the Jivas
from Kalpurush, as he was harrassing, and torturing the
Jivas.
Tab Ham Kaha Purush So Bani|
Agya Karahu Shabd Paravani||
Kalahi Meti Jiv Lai Avo|
Bar Bar Ka Jagahi Sidhavo||
Sahib then said to Parampurush that he would terminate
Kalpurush and get all the Jivas finally and there would be
no nid to go into the worldly ocean repeatedly.
Kaha Purush Suno Ho Gyani|

Parampurush said to Sahib that if Kal is terminated now,
his word to him will be violated, and therefore, as long as
the Jivas are in the clutches of Kalpurush Sahib should go
to the world and awaken Jivas in simple and easy manner.
Parampurush also said that there is no difference betwin
himself and Sahib and Kalpurush will inhabit whoever
distinguishes you from me. Parampurush then told Sahib
```

125 Sahib Bandgi
to go in to the world immediately, navigate the boat of the
life of the Jivas, and bring them to the safe shore.
Chale Tab Ham Math Navayi|
Purush Agya Jag Mahi Sidhayi||
Karunamay Tab Naam Dharaya|
Dwapar Yug Jab Mahi Mey Aya||
Sahib again at the command of Parampurush made
obeisance to him and came to the earth. In Dwapar Yug,
he was known as, ‘KaruNaamay’.
Gadh Girnar Tabahi Chali Aye|

In the Dwapar Yug Sahib came to Girnar. Here the
Queen of King Chandra Vijay who honoured and revered
ascatics and accomplished people (Sadhusand Mahatmas)
learning about the advent of Sahib she sent her maid to
usher Sahib in. This maid come to Sahib and respectfully
gave him the message of the Queen and told him of her
dip desire to get a glimpse (Darshan) of Sahib.
Tab Gyani Kahi Vachan Sunavai|
Raj Ravghar Ham Nahin Javai||
Raj Kaj Hai Maan Badhai|

Sahib then told the Maid that he did not go to the house of
Kings, as they are full of pride.
Chali Vrushali Rani Paha Ayi| Dwaikar Jor Vinay Sunayi||
Sadhun Ave Mor Bulai| Raj Ravghar Ham Nahi Jai||
Sun Indramati Uthi Chali Aun| Kinha Dandavat Teke Pau||
The Maid returned to the Queen and told her what
Sahib had told her. Upon hearing this, the Queen,


Anuragsagar Vani 126
Indramati herself came to Sahib and touched his feet while
lying prostrate.
Indramati says
He Sahib Mopar Karu Daya| More Gruh Ab Dhariye Paya||
The Queen begged Sahib to set his feet inside her house.
Sahib says
Priti Dekh Ham Bhavan Sidhare|

Sahib tells Dharmadas that he was moved by the
loving devotion of the Queen and he went to her house.
Sahib says that the Queen offered him the throne, washed
his feet and believed that her life became worthwhile.
The Queen says
Puni Prasad Ko Agya Mangi|
He Prabhu Mokaha Karahu Subhagi||
Juthan Parai Mor Gruh Mahi|

Rani then prays Sahib for the Sit Prasad.

Sahib told the Queen that he does not not fil hungry,as
his body is not made of the five elements; he only has
nectar as food. Sahib says that the Jivas are the part from
of Parampurush, who has beenbeguiled and captivated and
held hostage by Kalpurush. Sahib further says that he has
come to set the Jivas free. He says that whoever
recognizes him and surrenders to him, will be freed of this
worldly ocean and will go to Amarlok. Kal has kept the
Jivas captive with him by deceit and has created the
perishable element of air, water etc and used the same to
construct the bodies for the Jivatmas. However, Sahib’s
body is different and is made of the word of Parampurush.
This was my brief introduction and now you should try to
understand the same.
Indramati says

Anuragsagar Vani 128
Indramati expressed amazement that she has not sin
anybody like Sahib nor heard about such a body.
Therefore, she requested Sahib to tell her where he had
come from, where he acquired such a body, and what is
his Naame? She requested Sahib to tell her all this as she
wanted to know more about him.

Sahib says that he comes from Amarlok the abode of
Parampurush, which is beyond this mortal world ( 3
Lokas).where Yama (Death) cannot enter. The glory of
that world is such that millions of Suns and Moons would
not compare to even a hair of Parampurush and every soul
has brilliance of sixtin Suns. The grandeur of the Immortal
World is beyond any description, one who reaches there is
very fortunate. Sahib has arrived here from the same
world and he is known here by his Naame KaruNaamay.
Actuality he arrives in every Era, he was known by
different Naames- Satsukrut in Satayug (First Era),

Munindra in Tretayug (Second Era) and KaruNaamay in
Dwapar yug (Third Era) and one who understood and
believed his words, will be taken by him to Amarlok.

Indramati prays Sahib to free her from Yama she tells
Sahib that she is willing all her kingdom to him and
sacrifice all her wealth. She also prays Sahib to take her in
his shelter and free her from the web of Kal.

Sahib tells Indramati that he will free her from Kalpurush
by giving her Naam. Then Sahib tells her to bring things
required for Prayer (Arati) and perform the Arati, so that
she can be freed from fear of death. Sahib tells her that he

Indramati told Sahib that she had full confidence that he
was the Parampurush. There is no one greater than Sahib.
She requested Sahib, about the requirements for Arati.

The Queen came to Sahib again. Sahib told her about the
character of Kal and said that she has taken His Naam.
Knowing this Kal will take the form of snake and will bite


Anuragsagar Vani 132
her. So always remember to meditate on the Naam, and
then poison of Kal will not affect her. Next time Kal will
come again in the form of Swan to cheat you, so he said
he will make her understand Kal’s appearance so that you
can recognize him. His forehead is small, eyes are black,
and other organs are white.
Rani Charan Gahe Tab Dhayi|He Prabhu Mohi Lok Lai Jayi||
Yah To Des Kal Kar Thane|He Prabhu Lai Chal Des Amani||
The Queen told Sahib that she is in the Mortal World, she
requested him to carry her to the Amarlok.
Tab Rani So Kaheu Bujhae|Bachan Hamar Suno Chitt Lai||
Jab Lagi Theka Pure Aai|Tab Lag Raho Naam Lau Lai||
Sahib says to Indramati that he will not carry her Jiva
before completing her age. So she must kip chanting till
the end of her life and After completing it, he will carry
her to Amarlok.
Gajarupi Hai Kal,Kehari Purush Pratap Hai|
Rok Raho Tum Dhal,Kal Khadag Vyape Nahi||
Sahib says that Kal is like as an humangous elephant, but
the Sar Naam of Parampurush is like as a brave lion,Kal
cannot do anything if the shield of the true Naam is with
her.
Itna Kah Ham Gupta Chhipaya|Takshak Rup Kal Ho Aya||
Jabahi Rat Biti Adhi|Rani Uth Chali Seva Sadhi||
Sej Aya Rani Paudhayi|Daseu Vyal Mastak Maha Jayi||
Sahib became invisible after telling Rani about the secret
of Kal and the true Naam and immediately Kal came in
the form of snake. The Queen retired for the play in
midnight, after performing her service and prayers.Then
Kal bit her forehead.
Indramati says
Indramati As Vachan Sunaye|Takshak Daseu Mohi Kaha Ayi||
Sun Raja Vyakul Hai Dhava|Guni Garudi Vegi Bulava||

133 Sahib Bandgi
Indramati called the King and said that the snake has
bitten her. Listening this, the king sorrowfully came
running and called the best doctor. The King told
Indramati that she was dearer to him, than his own life, he
would save you. Just wait and the effect of poison will
vanish in a moment.
Indramati says
Mantra Mohi Lakhay Satguru, Garal Mohi Na Lagai||
Hot Surya Prakash Jehi Kshan, Andh Aghor Nashavai||
The Queen told the King that Satguru has given her true
‘Naam’, so poison will not affect her. Saying this, the
Queen kept chanting the true Naam and in a short while,
she came to senses and got up.
Vishnuji sent his messenger
Kahe Vishnu Sunaho Yamaduta|Satahi Anga Karo Tum Puta||
Chhal Kari Jai Livaiy Rani|Vachan Hamar Lehu Tum Mani||
Vishnu told Yamadut to disguise himself in white robe,
bring the Queen by deception, and obey his words.
The messenger came to the Queen

Yamdut disguised himself in white robe, came to the
Queen and asked her, why she was unhappy, and told her
that he has given her the true Naam, his Naame is Gyani.
Kal in the form of snake had come to bite you. Then I
saved you. Now I have come to take you, come with me.
The Queen says

The Queen immediately recognized him, because
Sahib had told her about the appearance of Kal; that his
forehead would be small,his eyes would be black .So the
Queen told him that it was not right for a crow to take the
form of Swan. My Guru is very capable.
Yaha Sun Kal Nikat Chali Ava|Indramati Par Thap Chalava||
Thap Chalay Sumukh Par Mara|Rani Khasi Pari Bhomi

After listening this, Kal slapped Indramati, and she fell
on the ground. Queen Indramati prayed Sahib to save her.
Sunat pukar muhi raho na jay|
Sunahu Dharmani Yah Mor Subhay||
Rani Jabahi Kinha Pukara|
Tatachhan Main Taha Pagu Dhara||

Sahib tells Dharmadas, that whenever somebody calls him
with pure heart, he compulsively reaches him. This is his
nature. Therefore, when the Queen prayed him for his
help, he immediately reached there to help. The Queen felt
very happy on seeing him and her fear of Kal disappeared.

Chinha Pari Mohi Yam Ki Chhahin|

The Queen prayed with folded hands and said that she had
understood the obstruction of Kal, so she did not want to
live in this Mortal World anymore, she requested Sahib to
take her to Amarlok, so that she can escape the tortures in
this world

Then Sahib took Indramati to Amarlok along with
him .After-seeing ManSarovar, Amrut Sarovar, Suratika
sagar (Concentration), the Queen reached Man Sarovar,
there she was very happy to si the grandeur of the


Anuragsagar Vani 136
Amarlok. All Swans paid obeisance to the Queen and told
her that she is great as she recognized the Satguru; her
tortures were now over. Then Sahib told Indramati to
come and have a glimpse (Darshan) of Parampurush. All
the Swans also acoompanied with her happily, thinking
that they too will get a glimpse of Parampurush. Then on
the request of Sahib, Parampurush gave his Darshan.
Purush Kanti Jab Dekhau Rani|
Adabhut Ami Sudha Ki Khani||
Gadgad Hoy Charan Lapatani|
Hansa Subhadhdi Sujan Gungyani||
Seeing the grandeur of Parampurush, the Queen felt very
happy and she fell on his feet. Parampurush told the
Queen to call KaruNaamay. When the Queen came to
Sahib, she was surprised to find that Sahib himself is
Parampurush; there was no difference betwin Him and
Parampurush.
Kah Rani Yah Acharaj Ahi|

The Queen said that she did not si any difference
betwin Sahib and Parampurush. She said that she had
understood the nature of Shibji. The Queen further said
that he is a Parampurush and yet is called a Servant and
hide his identity, but now the Queen is sure that Sahib
himself is Parampurush and no one else.
Then the Queen requested Sahib to bring the King into
his Immortal World. She said that he (King) is walking
into the jaws of death (Kalpurush). He never obstructed


137 Sahib Bandgi
her, while she was servin the Saints. After accepting the
request, Sahib came to Gadh Giranar and reached
Amarlok with the King.
Sahib says to Dharmadas that he came again in this
Mortal World and awakened Supach ,Sudarshan and
bestowed ‘Naam’.Then it was end of Dwapar Yug (3rd
Era).
Dharman Puni Aye Jagamahi|
Rani Pati Lai Gaye Tahanhi||
Rakhyo Tahi Lok Manjhara|
Tatachhin Puni Ayau Sansara||
Kashi Nagar Kaha Chali Aye|

After bringing the King to Amarlok, Sahib again came to
this Mortal World and he awakened Supach. He became a
good devoti when the battle of Mahabharat betwin
Kauravas – Pandavas got over. Krishna asked Pandavas to
perform a Yagya in order to overcome the sins of killing
their brothers. In the Yagya, a bell was fixed in the sky.
Krishna said —
Pandav Prati Bole Yadupala|
Puran Yagya Jan Tihi Kala||
Ghanta Akash Bajat Suni Ave|
Yagya Ko Fal Puran Pave||
Bhojan Vividh Prakar Banai|
Param Priti Se Sabahi Jebai||
Ichchha Bhojan Sab Mili Pava|
Ghant Nahinbaja Raya Lajava||
Bhojan Kin Sakal Rishi Raya|
Baji Na Ghant Bhupbhram Aya||
Krishna said that Yagya would be successful only when
the bell rings, The Yagya performed. All Brahmins,
Rushis, Munis and Sanyasis were called for a feast, but
the bell did not ring. Then the Pandavas were embarrassed
and went to Krishna.
Karike Krupa Kaho Yaduraja|


Anuragsagar Vani 138
Karan Kaun Ghant Nahi Baja||
Krushna As Karan Tasu Bataya|
Sadhu Koi Na Bhojan Paya||
Pandav asked Krishna why the bell not ringed. Krishna
answered them that the food was not taken by a true Saint.
Chakit Bhai Tab Pandav Kahei|

Ab Kahan Sadhu Paiya Natha|
Tinate Tab Bole Yadunatha||
Supach Sudarshan Ko Lai Avo|

Pandavas said that several Saints have beenoffered food,
Krishna himself has taken food and yet he says that a true
Saint has taken food, and then from where should such a
Sadhu be brought. Then Krishna said that only
SupachSudarshin is the true sant, so get him with full
respect and offer him food. Then only Yagya would be
successful. Then he was offered food.
Supach Bhakt Gras Uthava| Bajo Ghanta Naam Parabhava||
Bhup Bhavan Bhojan Kar Jabahi| Baja Akash Me Ghanta

Then Supach took food, and the bell ringed in the sky and
the Yagya became successful.As per the word given to the
Kalpurush/ Niranjan, Sahib took only a few Jivas to
Amarlok in first thri Eras but in Kaliyug, he had many
disciples.

Sahib says that he has told him the story of Supach
Sudarshan from Dwapar Era. When he took him to
Amarlok, Supach requested him to give Naam to his
parents also & bring them to Amarlok.Sahib persuaded
them a lot, but they did not agri, they did not take Naam.
Then heading to the request of Supach, he decided to free
them from this wordly ocean. In next birth they became
Brahman & lady Brahmani under the influence of
Supach’s devotion & were reborn as Human Beings
again.They were childless & the lady was praying for a
son from the Sun, just then Sahib fell into lap. She thought
that the sun has blessed her with a son.Then she brought
Him home.

Now Sahib began to make them understand, but they
did not agri, therefore he became invisible.

Then in the next birth they became Shah Shahani,
their Naames were Chandan & Ooda.

Then Sahib came to their village and appeared in the
nearby pond. He remained there for a day, in the morning
when Ooda came to take bath, she was enchanted to see
the beautiful baby & she brought him at her house.
Kah Chanadan Ke Murakh Nari| Vegi Jahu Dai Balak Dari||

Chandan asked Ooda as to whom she had brought,
and told her to go back & leave him from where she had
brought him otherwise people would ridicule them. Then
for the fear of Chandan she was going back to leave him.

Then sahib disappeared from her hand. On seeing,
both began to wip and began to search for him
everywhere, but they did not find him. Then Nima got
Him in Lahartala pond at Kashi with the fear of Niru,
Nima was going to leave Sahib again. Then he told-
Prit Pichali Karane, Tohi Mila Hun Aap|
Mukti Sandesh Sunaunga, Le Chal Apne Sath||
These Niru & Nima were the parents of Supach who
became Niru Nima in the third birth but they did not
believe him considering Sahib as an ordinary boy. Then in
the fourth birth they were born in Mathura, there Sahib
convinced them and they took Naam, and were liberated.

some time, after that Parampurush sent Niru to awaken
Jivas in this Mortal World but Kal entrapped Niru into his
clutches.

Sahib told Dharmadas that he was a part of them and
Parampurush had sent him to awaken Jivas in this world,
but he entrapped in the web of Kal and forgot. The
purpose of his being due to this reason, Sahib has given
him his glimpse, now believe me & contemplate on
‘Naam’.

and to give him Sar Naam & free him from ‘Kal’ Then
after giving Naam Sahib told him-

Sahib tells Dharmadas that ten incarnations were

Sahib told Dharmadas, about the importance of
worshiping Guru and said that till the soul is his body,
obey Guru’s words only. When the Guru is happy, the
Satpurush is also happy. Even if a million efforts were


Anuragsagar Vani 146
made, without a Guru, it will go in vain. Only one in a
million, wise Saint is convinced of his words. But Guru is
one who has the secret Naam. Then Sahib further
explained the importance of Naam -
Kal Yahi Naam Pratap Dharman, Hans Chhute Kal So|
Satat Naam Mann Bich Brudh Gahe, So Nistare Yam Jal
So||
Yam Tasu Nikat Avai, Jehi Vansh Ki Partit Ho|
Kalika Ke Sir Pav De, Chale Bhavajal Jiti Ho||
Sahib told Dharmadas that Seat of Guru (successor)
shall be given only to his Shabd putra (Initate with True
Naam) and not to his biological son.
Kahan Nirgam Kahan Sargun Bhai|
Nad Bina Nahi Panth Chalai||
Dharmani Nadh Putra Tum Mori|

Sahib tells Dharmadas that even in some Sargun and
Nirgun bhakti Shabd putra runs the Sect. further says that
Dhamadas is his Shabd putar, so he has handed over the
baton in form of Naam for liberating the Jivas.
Dharmadas asks
Ab Prabhu Daya Karo Tum Gyani|
Vachan Vansh Pragate Jag Ani||
Aage Jehite Panth Chalai|

Dharmadas asked how his Sect would go on.
Sahib says

Sahib says that there shall be his incarnation in
Dharmadasji’s house after ten months, the thing that Sahib
has given him, is be handed over to that incarnation. He
who will come as his son, will be his part.

will be created, by word (Shabd) & he would be a part of
Sahibji.

Sahib told Dharmadas to give Naam to his wife. All
the doubt of Dharnadas was cleared, and he called upon
his wife Amin over and asked her to touch Sahib’s feet.
Then he gave her ‘Paras Naam.’ Thus, she conceived with
Surati & Chudamani Sahib appeared.

Then sahib went to his house and said that his 42
generations, their branches and sub branches will be
created. They will liberate all the Jivas.

Sahib told Dharmadas that there shall be 360 branches
after 42 generations and then there shall be 10,000 sub
branches. Sahib adds that just he has given Dharmadas the
Naam, similarly his generation will also be given baton of
Naam. They all shall be sons created by soundless sound
(Shabd Putra).

Sahib told Dharamadas that throne shall be handed over
only to the Shabd Putra the. He enlivened Kamal but he
was proud about Sahibji considering him as his father,
hence he has handed over baton of Naam, to Dharamadas
and not to him. Sahib told Dharamadas that he is hungry
for love not wealth, he is not affected by ego, he would
have handed over the Baton to Pandit and Kaji but where
there is as ego Sahib cannot be there, only Kal can be
there so such Jivas cannot go to Amarlok.
Narayandas, the son of Dharamadas was a critic of
Sahib. He did not take Naam; Sahib told him that he is in
the fold of Kal, so to leave him, but Dharamadas pleded
repetedly to Sahib for giving him Naam to his son. Then
Sahib told him that he should overcome the affection for
his son and asked him to follow the word of his Guru and
become Guru muk. Sahib told him-

Guru And Satguru

Pratham Vandon Satgurucharan Jin,
Agam Gamya Lakhaiya.
Guru Geyan Deep Prakash Kari,
Patt Khol Darash Dikhaiya.
Jihi Karney Sidya Pachey, So Guru Kirpa Se Paiya.
Akah Moorti Amiya Soorti, Ta Hi Jaye Smaiya.
First of all the high status of a Guru has been described
in the beginning of Anurag Sagar. After all, there is some
weightage in describing the greatness of a Satguru. In
Sagun, such a high status has not been accorded to a Guru.
This is because there one finds only a mention of the
necessity of a Guru for achieving salvation. Therefore,
everyone is trying to seek the shelter of some Guru for
formality sake. On the other hand, Satguru is the very root
of Bhakti (worship) in Sant Matt.
Guru Bin Mala Phairtey, Guru Bin Detey Daan.
Guru Bin Daan Haram Hai, Poochho Ved Puran.
Garbh Yogeshwar Guru Bina, Laga Hari Ki Seib.
Kahe Kabir Baikunth Te, Phair Diya Shuk Dev.
Even Vedas and Puranas prescribes the acts of charity,
through a Guru, otherwise it is a wrong act. All the great
and noble Souls have taken the shelter of some or other
Guru. Lord Vishnu returned Shukdev from heaven saying,
he doesn’t like a person who has not taken the shelter of a
Guru.
Ram Krishan Se Kau Barha, Tin Bhi To Guru Keen.
Teen Lok Ke Ve Dhani, Guru Aage Aadheen.
Tridev (Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh) etc. also sought
the shelter of a Guru. That is why such a high status is
accorded to a Satguru.
Hari Sewa Yug Char Hai, Guru Sewa Pall Ek.
Tis Ka Pat-Tar na Tula, Santan Kiya Vivek.
Sahjo Aisa Dham Nahin, Sakal Und Brahmand.


Anuragsagar Vani 152
Sakal Tirath Guru Charan, To Bhi Sada Akhand.
Sagun has not attached so much importance to the status
of a Guru. In Puranas one finds the mention of a fight
between Bhisham and Parshu Ram, between Droan and
Arjun and between Gorakh Nath and Machhender Nath.
However, the Sant lineage is altogether different from
Yog Mat
Guru Aagya Le Aavhi, Guru Aagya Le Jahin.
Kahen Kabir Ta Dass Ko, Teen Lok Darr Nahin.
**‘Guru Ka Kathan Maan Sabb Lijey, Satya Asatya
Vichar Na Kijey.’** Guruvad is different from dictatorship.
Then what is the reason there of. We shall discuss it later
on. Why there hasn’t been such a high status for a Guru?
This is because most of the Gurus are family holders.
They guide their disciples to visit holy places, observe
fasts, perform Yajyas and do noble deeds. The Sants
didn’t denounce these. A child is first sent to a nursery so
that he learns some manners. If he refuses to move further,
he is in ignorance. In Sagun upasana, the Guru blesses the
disciple with holy Naam but doesn’t accept responsibility
any more. He simply asks the disciple to do noble deeds
for attaining heaven. The disciple knows that he can seek
liberation by doing noble deeds, so he also attaches great
importance to Karmas than to Guru. It is sufficient for him
to have a meeting with the Guru once or twice a year.
However, the Santl Matt is different from it. Sahibji
says—
Guru Ka Darshan Kije, Din Mein Keyi Keyi Bar...
Sahibji said everything in an impartial manner. Sagun
Bhakti has not been shown much importance. The
devotees do evil deeds but the Gurus seldom prevent them
from doing so.
In Nirgun Bhakti, great importance has been attached to
Yog. Here as well, much importance has not been attached
to the status of a Guru. This kind of Bhakti has five


153 Sahib Bandgi
features. The Guru guides the disciple to practice Yog. He
tells him the secret of 10th dwara and thereafter he frees
himself from further responsibility. He simply asks the
disciple to meditate and awaken the inner powers. The
devotee begins to think that he has to seek salvation
through his own efforts. Sahibji says—
Yogi Yog Sadhna Karyi, Bhav Sagar Se Nahin Taryi.
He knows that all he has is the result of his own earning,
so he develops a sort of ego. Whole world is talking of
Bhakti but none is in a position to understand its secrets.
Just as there are different streams in education—Arts,
Commerce, Science etc., there are five streams in Nirgun
Bhakti. The Yogis meditate on five Mudras (Postures) and
attain Siddhis. Nevertheless, Sahibji has said—
Sidh Saadh Tridevadi Ley,
Panch Shabad Mein Atke.
Mudra Saadh Rahey Ghat Bhitar,
Phir Aundhey Munh Latkey.
They stopped upto this place but couldn’t go further.
They continued to awaken their mental powers by
concentrating at different points within their bodies. As a
result, they had to take birth repeatedly. It means one’s
own earnings are not going to help one achieve salvation.
So Sahibji has said—
Iske Aage Bheid Hamara,
Janey Ga Koyi Jananhara.
Kahein Kabir Janeyga Soyi,
Ja Per Kripa Satguru Ki Hoyi.
Now there has been a mention of the word Satguru. He
who teaches in a college is called as a lecturer while he
who teaches in a high school is called as a master. In this
way, he who shows the path of three Lokas is called as a
Guru. However, he too simply shows the path as he
himself in not in a position to take the Jiva to his real
abode.


Anuragsagar Vani 154
A simple doctor possesses some workable knowledge of
the various diseases. He can cure simple diseases like ear
pain, headache, stomachache etc., but if the problem is of
some serious nature, he will refer the case to some
specialist. Likewise, Satguru is a specialist. The problem
of repeated birth and death is very deep rooted. Since ages
together the Soul has been wandering here and the forces
responsible for binding it are also very powerful. The Jiva
has been entangled in a powerful grip of Kal. A simple
Guru can’t help in liberating it. He can, at the most, show
Jiva the path whereby he can be able to attain one kind of
salvation out of the four—Salokya, Samipya, Sayujya and
Saropya, which are of temporary in nature. That is to say
he can’t achieve complete and permanent salvation. Even
the Shastras have accepted this view. Suppose one out of
lakhs succeeds in reaching Brahm Lok, Nirakar Lok etc.,
but still he will remain within the limits of Kal and will
have to return to the world again. Therefore, a ordinary
Guru fails to give a permanent relief from this disease.
Koyi Koyi Pahuncha Brahm Lok Mein,
Dhar Maya Ley Aayi.
Just as an allopathic medicine can’t give permanent cure
from a disease, a simple Guru also can’t do so in the
spiritual field.
Jiva will have to make a search for some true Satguru
who not only shows the path but also directly takes him to
his real abode Amarlok, which is not the Brahm Lok or
Nirakar but is far above the 3 lokas. The Jiva will not
return to this world from that Amar Lok.
Tahke Gaye Bahuri Na Aavey......
Therefore, it is only a Satguru who can help jiva cross
the ocean of births and deaths.
Satguru Ke Updesh Ka, Suniya Ek Vichar.
Jo Satguru Milta Nahin, Jata Yam Ke Dwar.
Yam Dwarey Mein Doot Sabb, Kertey Einchatani.


155 Sahib Bandgi
Unte Kabhu Na Chhut-ta, Phirta Charon Khani.
Chari Khani Mein Bharamta, Kabhun Na Lagta Par.
So Phera Sabb Miti Geya, Satguru Ke Upkar.
Guru doesn’t occupy a prominent place in Sagun-Nirgun
Bhakti. He tells his disciple about Bhuchri or Chachri
Mudra and the disciple knows that he himself has to do
the rest. That is why less importance has been shown to a
Guru. However, in the line of Santl Matt, satguru has been
considered as greater than Paramatma even. There is some
secret in saying so...
The status of Mother and father is high but that of mother
is higher. That is why everyone says Mata-Pita (mother
and father) and not Pita-Mata (father and mother). One
higher in status occupies the first place. Similarly, we say
Ram-Lakhman and not Lakhman-Ram. This is because
the status of Ram is higher than that of Lakhman. It means
the status of mother is higher. However it doesn’t mean
the father has no importance. In the body of a child there
is 90% element of mother and 10% that of father. The
semen of father helped in the formation of bones while the
blood of mother contributed to the formation of muscles,
nails etc. Where could the blood stay without bones. In the
egg of a hen, the outer white part is made out of the
mother’s blood while the yellowish part is made out of
father’s semen. So both have their own importance. If
some one wants to see the Sagun Brahm, show him the
mother and father. In comparison to father, the mother
shows more concern and care. She keeps the child for 9-
10 months in her womb. She can herself remain hungry
but would in no case like to see her child hungry. Again,
after giving birth to a child, the mother loses much of her
shine and energy. The baby draws much out of the
mother. It has beautifully been said—
Janani Janey To Dui Jan, Ik Data Ik Soor.
Na To Janani Banjh Rah, Kahey Gnwaye Noor.


Anuragsagar Vani 156
A mother should either give birth to a Bhakt or a warrior.
The nature of a child depends on the mother. If she takes
to worship during pregnancy, she will give birth to a
Bhakat (devotee). On the other hand, if she listens to the
stories of warriors, she will give birth to a warrior.
Clearly, there is a great contribution of mother. Just as a
mother is accorded a high status, a Satguru is also
accorded the same.
Guru Hain Barhe Govind Se, Munn Mein Dekh Vichar.
Hari Sumire So Var Hai, Guru Sumire So par.
Saat Deep Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Barha Na Koye.
Karta Karey Na Kari Sakey, Guru Karey So Hoye.
Kabira Hari Ke Roohtey, Guru Ki Sharney Jaye.
Kahein Kabir Guru Roothtey, Hari Nahin Hoat Sahaye.
Sahibji has not considered the two as equal. He has said
that in no case the paramatma appears to be ahead of a
Guru. He has expressed a scientific and a rational view. In
Sagun-Nirgun Bhakti we don’t find such an importance.
Why did the fight between Bhisham and Parshu Ram take
place? Parshu thought that he had become more powerful
than Bhisham. However, this is not possible in the line of
Sant Matt. In this line, it has been clearly said—
Guru Googe Guru Banvrey, Guru Ke Rahiye Dass.
Jey Guru Bhejeyn Narak Mein, Na Rakho Swarg Ki Aas.
Sunder Dass ji says that the status of a Guru is
undoubtedly greater than that of Govind. He has explained
in a rational manner—
Govind Ke Kiye Jeev Jaat Hain Rasatal Kau
Guru Updesey Suto Chhutein Jam Phand Tein.
Govind Ke Kiye Jeev Sabb Parein Karmni Kei.
Guru ke Nivajey So Phirat Hain Svachhand Tein.
Govind Ke Kiye Jeev Boorhat Bhav Sagar Mein.
Sunder Kahat Guru Karhein Dukh Duand Tein.
Aur Ou Kahan Loun Kachhu Mukhtey Kahon Banai.
Guru Ki Mahima Adhik Hai Govind Tein.


157 Sahib Bandgi
The Sants raised the status of a Guru to great
heights.(Guru cannot be higher than Gods at the same
time worshiping them, therefore Kabir Sahib declared
real Guru as Satguru in connection with Satya Bhakti,
Satlok, Satpurush and permanent Salvation)
Guru Ka Kathan Maan Sabb Lijey.
Satya Asatya Vichar Na Kijey.
A disciple should remain faithful to his Satguru without
bothering for the results. However, this is not for the
Gurus indulged in Sagun-Nirgun Bhakti. Then what does
the Satguru give to the disciple? A Satguru is the
storehouse of the invisible spiritual power. He can transfer
that power in your interior within a moment.
Kotin Tirath Bhram Bhram Aawey.
So Phal Guru Ke Charnan Pawey.
Such a high status has been accorded to a Guru.
Wherefrom did this power come? He who’s Soul has
become united with that of Paramatma, has the power to
bring the desired change in you. Perhaps you think
spiritualism means to achieve what one desires. Certainly
not. These are all Siddhis (miraculous powers).
Ashat Siddhi Nav Nidhi Ko, Sadhu Marat Laat.
The Sants possess the greatest Siddhi. Do you know
what would happen when he transfers the spiritual power
in your interior?

Keet Na Janay Bhring Ko, Guru Ker Ley Aap Sman.
The Satguru will change you into his ownself.
*****-***** ,

Jab Tak Guru Miley Nahin Saacha
Tab Tak Guru Karo Dus Paancha.
Kabir Sahib says that there is no harm or sin in taking
even 5 or 10 Gurus until you find a complete and real
living Guru.
