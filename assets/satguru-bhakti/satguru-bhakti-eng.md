Nam paye satya jo veera,
sang rahun main dass Kabira.
Kabir Sahib says that he remains at all the times
with the devotee who gets himself blessed with
the Holy Nam.
Kag palat hansa ker deena.
Aisa purush nam main deena.
I bless with the Holy Nam related to Param Purush
that has the power to turn even a crow into a swan.
```
**A Few Words**
_Satguru mara tani ke, shabad surange baan.
Mera mara phir jiye, to hath na gahun kaman._
**The Satguru shot with full force an arrow in the form of
words. He declared that if munn survives even after his
shooting of arrow, he won’t hold the bow again.**
Many devotees have experienced that whenever they
begin to indulge in some wrong act even unknowingly or
whenever they are about to meet some accident, some hidden
power comes to their rescue. This hidden power is nothing but
the power of Nam about which I have repeatedly said—

**The Thing I possess**

**cannot be found**

**anywhere else.**

WHO IS KAL PURUSH AND
PARAM PURUSH? LET’S TRY TO
UNDERSTAND THIS SECRET!
```
_Ved charon nahin janat, Satya Purush kahaniyan._
**All the four Vedas does not know anything about the
reality related to Param Purush.**
Kabir Sahib was the first Saint to reveal to the
world the secret of the creation of ‘Adi’. He did so to
satisfy the curiosity of Dharam Dass Ji. He said that at
first Satya Purush was all alone & unknown. He was
neither created nor will ever perish. That which is cre-
ated is sure to perish. Kabir Sahib says, “I am talking
of the time when there was no existence of Sakar (with
form), Nirakar (formless), the universe, the sun, the
moon, the stars, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh & even
Kal Niranjan (Mind).”
First of all, that hidden & unknown Supreme
Lord uttered a word of His own accord. It resulted in
the production of a wonderful dazzling white light
that was altogether different from the worldly light.
Every single particle of it was sufficient to put even
crores of suns to shyness. Satya Purush Himself got
absorbed in that light which then became alive.
After making His appearance in light, the un-
known Supreme Lord was called as Satya Purush or
Param Purush. It was this, that was later on called as
Amar Lok or Satya Lok.
**5**


**6 Sahib Bandgi**
Then, in His own pleasurefull, mood, He scat-
tered His own appearance (the dazzling light into
which He had absorbed Himself) from His Ownself.
Infinite number of drops were produced. These drops
returned to that wonderful & indescribable light but
didn’t get mixed up with it. All these retained their
separate identities. This is because Satya Purush de-
sired so. These were called as Jivas (Souls-Hansas). All
the Jivas began to move about in that very light in a
manner a fish does in water.
**In Amar Lok, the light of Soul is equal to that
of 16 suns. After this, Satya Purush uttered 16 words
that took the form of His sixteen sons (in the form of
words). After this the fifth son of Satya Purush as
Niranjan, who is also knows as Nirakar, Narayan,
Munn, Ram, Karim, Brahma, Parmeshwar,
Paramatma, Hari, Bhagwan, Alakh Niranjan, Aadhi
Niranjan etc. by the worldly people, concentrated at
Param Purush & meditated on Him for 70 Yug’s,
standing on one foot. Satya Purush got pleased with
his devotion & gave him Mansarovar Island (a part
of Amarlok) to live.**
Niranjan was very much pleased to have it &
again meditated on Param Purush like before for the
same period. Param Purush was much pleased & asked
him the reason behind performing such a hard wor-
ship. At this, Niranjan asked Him to either give him
the empire of Amar Lok or to give him a separate &
rare Loka where he could exercise his full control &


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 7
```
power. Satya Purush said that He would bestow on
him the rule for 17 chaukri Asankhya Yug’s. He also
asked him to get the needed seed from his elder
brother, Kuram & create a separate Universe in Shunya
(nothingness). Niranjan went to his elder brother &
instead of making request, forcibly cut off his three
heads & took away from his belly the seed of 5 ele-
ments. In this way, Niranjan created 49 crore yojan
of land, sun, moon, stars, seven patals, seven Lokas
etc. & began to live in Shunya. But, there were no
jivas. He thought that such a Universe could be of no
use without the jivas. So, once again, he meditated on
Param Purush for a period of 64 Yug’s. Param Purush
asked him as to what more he wanted. Niranjan re-
plied that without souls there was none he could rule
over. He requested Param Purush to give him some of
the souls.
At this, Param Purush created Adi Shakti & giv-
ing her innumerable souls said, “O daughter! Go to
Mansarovar & alongwith Niranjan create the real uni-
verse. Param Purush didn’t allow the souls to be put
inside the physical bodies.
On seeing the beauty of Adi Shakti, Niranjan
developed lustful thoughts & swallowed her. Param
Purush got offended at this & hurled a curse on him
saying, “You will swallow one lakh bodies daily & will
still remain unsatisfied. You will create 1¼ lakh bod-
ies daily, but you will never be able to reach Amarlok.”
Since that very time Niranjan has been called as Kal


```
8 Sahib Bandgi
```
Purush.
The cruelties meted out to Kuramji & Adi Shakti
perturbed Param Purush to such an extent that He
decided to put an end to the very existence of
Niranjan. But, he thought that in case he did so, the
other sons who were connected with him (with the
power of concentration) would also lose their exist-
ence. Moreover, the word He had given to him to
rule for 17 Chaukri Asankhya Yug’s would also break.
Param Purush created Kabir Sahib by churning
Himself and told him to throw out Niranjan from
Mansarovar. He did so to prevent him from coming
back to Amar Lok. As per the dictates of Sahibji,
Yogjeet (Kabir Sahib) threw Niranjan into Shunya.
After some time Niranjan gained consciousness & got
up. Adi Shakti remembered Param Purush & came
out of his belly. Seeing Niranjan, she felt afraid.
Niranjan said to her politely that he wasn’t afraid
of any sin or merit & that there was none to whom he
was accountable for all this. So she shouldn’t feel afraid
of him. Param Purush had created her for him. Adi
Shakti with eight arms agreed to live with him. She
gave birth to three sons-Brahma, Vishnu & Shiv.
Niranjan told Adi Shakti, “You are in posses-
sion of the Souls & seeds. I handover the three sons to
you. I shall disappear in Shunya (vaccum) & will re-
main with all the Souls in the guise of Mind. Don’t
reveal my identity to anyone. None will be able to see
me. You rule alongwith the three sons and send them


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 9
```
for churning of the sea when they become mature.”
Just see! Kal Niranjan associated Adi Shakti with
him to hide the identity of Param Purush. He also
disclosed to her the secret of creating 4 Khani’s (modes
of creation of living beings like, production out of
egg etc.) & 84 lac species. He decided to be present
within every human being in the form of Mind so as
to prevent them from knowing the real identity of
Param Purush.
When the sons became mature, Adi Shakti sent
them for churning of the sea. In the meantime, Kal
Niranjan performed a miracle. Through his breath he
produced Vedas in air. Niranjan hadn’t written any
book. He had only uttered the words regarding Vedas.
That is why the Vedas speak about Nirakar only. These
don’t reveal his true identity. After churning of the
sea, Brahma got Vedas, Vishnu got Glamour & Shivji
got Poison. The mother told each of them to keep
what he had got.
Kabir Sahib says to Dharam Dassji, “Once again,
Adi Shakti sent her three sons for churning of the sea.
In the meantime, she produced three girls & asked them
to disappear in the sea. After churning of the sea, the
three brothers found these three girls. Adi Shakti got
her sons married with these girls. Brahma got Savitri,
Vishnu got Lakshmi & Shivji got Parvati. All the sons
were very much pleased & began to lead pleasureful
lives in the company of their respective partners.
Devtas (gods) & Rakhshasas (devils) were born
to them. This set in motion the process of the cre-


```
10 Sahib Bandgi
```
ation of the universe.
_Eka mayi jugti viyayi teeni chele parvan.
Eku sansari eko bhandari, ek laye dewan._
**All the three sons were assigned different kinds
of duties for the creation of the universe.
Brahmaji was assigned the duty of creation,
Vishnuji that of sustainance & Shivji that of de-
struction.**
Further, 33 crore gods, whom the world wor-

ships in one form or the other, are also included in

the family of Kal Niranjan.

```
Out of the five basic elements that are the basis
```
of creation of the entire universe, four can be seen

with the naked eye whereas the fifth one, the sky, is

present in all the four elements. This fifth element is

none else but Niranjan. Out of 84 lac species, the

human form (species) that Niranjan made like his

ownself is also called as Hari Mandir (temple of God).

```
The Hansa (souls) has nothing to do with any
```
country, god, goddess, body etc. Niranjan has created

84 lac kinds of Prison houses to keep the Hansa (souls)

imprisoned. This Hansa, that is a part of Satya Purush,

keeps shining without any wick & oil; it sees without

eyes, moves without feet & hears without ears. None

can cut it. It is fearless & immortal.

```
In order to free the Hansa from the bodily cage,
```

```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 11
```
one need to get blessed with the bodiless Nam from

some true Satguru. Without doing so, the Hansa can’t

reach Amarlok.

```
The five words in the form of seed, that
```
Niranjan used to create the body of five elements,

have also their place in the body.

```
In order to keep the Hansas (souls) away from
```
Param Purush (Supreme Father) & to keep them en-

tangled in his own worship, Niranjan gave them the

bodily related mantras to recite. All the jivas includ-

ing great Rishi-Munies, Sidhs, devotees, Brahma,

Vishnu, Mahesh, Peers, Paigambers & the like got en-

tangled in these words.

```
Niranjan bestowed on such worshippers, vari-
```
ous kinds of miraculous powers including four kinds

of salvations. As a result, all such worshippers remained

absorbed in his worship & enjoying the pleasures aris-

ing out of 70 kinds of musical sounds emanating from

within the body. They began to seek solitary places in

order to enjoy the pleasures derived from these musi-

cal sounds. But they remained ignorant of the real

identity of Hansa (soul). As a result, the Hansa failed

to free himself from the body & also failed to reach

back to its real abode-Amarlok.

**A GREAT SAVIOUR OF**

**HUMANITY**

The incarnation of Sant Satguru Kabir Sahib Ji
took place on a full moon day in the early morning
of monday, 1398 in the Lahartala Pond of Kashi. The
birth of no other mahatma is shrouded with so many
mystries & doubts as that of Kabir Sahib. Some
described Him as the offspring of an unmarried
brahman girl, others described Him as a child with
uncertain identity & so on. Even today, his birth &
life is a mystery for the people of the world inspite of
the fact that he himself has described this mystery in
his own words. He has said that he has descended as a
pure light right from the Supreme Lord.
_Santo avigat se hum aaye, koyi bheid marm na paye.
Na hum rahey gharab vas mein, balak hoyi dikhlaye.
Kashi tatt sarovar bheetar, tahan julaha paye.
Na hamare bhai bandhu hain, na sung girhi dasi.
Neeru ke ghar nam dhraye, jagg mein ho geyi hansi.
Aane takiya ung hamari, ajar amar pur dera.
Hukam haisiyat se chal aaye, katan yam ka phera.
Kashi mein hum prakat huvey, ramanand per dhaya.
Kahai kabir suno bhai sadho, hans chetavan aaya._
**Kabir Sahib says, “I descended on this
earth from an unknown place & none**
14


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 15
could recognise my real identity. Without
remaining in the womb of the mother I
appeared as a child. A weaver found me in
the Lahartala Pond at Kashi. I have neither
any wife nor any other relation. My name
ceremony was performed in the home of
Neeru—the weaver. It made me a laughing
stock. My abode is in Amarlok & I have
come as per the desire of Param Purush
(Supreme Lord) to liberate the jivas from
the grip of Kal Niranjan & to take them to
their real abode—“Amarlok.”**
At many places Kabir Sahib ji has unfolded
wonderful mystries about himself. These make it
amply clear that he didn’t take birth in the womb of a
mother but rather appeared on the earth out of the
wonderful dazzling light of Param Purush. My
intention is not to create any confusion or doubt. I
want to present only the true reality in a scientific
way. The word Kabir hides in itself the meaning it
stands for.
_Kakka kewal nam hai, babba varan shareer.
R-Ra sabb mein rum raha, jiska nam Kabir._
**According to a holy saint, a soul which
has its true existence beyond five elements
and is present in every living being is Kabir.**
_Gagan mandal se utrey, Satguru Satya Kabir.
Jal manhi paurhan kiya, sabh piron ke peer._
**According to another saint Kabir Sahib**


**16 Sahib Bandgi
descended from sky & appeared in water.
He has called Him as the greatest saint.**
Many such like words make it clear that He was
an extraordinary personality. No other person has been
found to possess a multifaced personality like that of
Kabir Sahib ji. The society takes Him as a great social
reformer much before the time of Karl Marx. The
poets take Him as a poet Laureate who produced
simple, meaningful & revolutionary literature. The
critics take Him as a great plain speaking orator. Those
with knowledge of Brahm (God Niranjan) take Him
as a great exponent of knowledge of Brahm, while the
saints take Him as Sant Samrat or the first saint. The
Yogis on learning about His unparallelled mysteries
& inner paths of meditation take Him as a great
Yogeshwar. The Satirists describe Him as a great Satirist.
The Devotees on studying His writings about Bhakti
& devotion take Him as a great worshipper. The
administrators of justice on studying His reasoning
take him as a great judge.
The learned persons describe His status as great as
that of the Ganges among streams & rivers.He didn’t
establish any new religion. His only aim was to awaken
the Jivatma (Individual Soul). Alongwith the
awakening of a Soul, he preached the worship of all
powerful-Param Purush. Some describe Him as a
refuter but He threw light on the importance of every
kind of Worship & the destination where it could lead
one to. He described four kinds of Mukties (salvations)—


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 17
```
(Samipaya, Salokya, Saropya & Sayujaya ). He
described the ways to attain them. One can find these
ways in the Vedas. He told about Param Nirvan (Great
salvation) where the soul attains immortality. He also
described the whole of Universe as existing within the
physical body. His modes of meditation got due
recognition. Everyone recognised & accepted his style
& mode.

```
Kabir Sahib divided worship
into three parts
```
**Sargun Bhakti Nirgun Bhakti Pra Bhakti**

_Sunn gagan mein Sabad uthat hai, so sabb bol mein aavey.
Ni-Sabad woh boley nahin, so Satt Sabad kahavey.
—Paltoo Sahibji_
**All the words arising in the shunya (Sky-vacuum) forms the
subject of speech, whereas the true word is the only soundless
sound that in no way forms the subject of speech.**
_Sargun bhakti karey sansara,
Nirgun yogeshwar anusara._
**The Sargun form of worship is limited to the
worldly people while the Nirgun form of worship
is limited to yogeshvars.**
He talked of Bhakti that was far beyond these two.
_Jaap marey ajapa marey, anhad bhi mar jaye.
Surti smani shabad mein, usko kal na khaye._
**Sahib ji says that with the passage of time, he who
recites Nam with mouth, or inwardly or fixes his**

```
(Varn-natmic shabad)
( Speakable words )
```
```
(Dhunatmic shabad)
( Musical sounds )
```
```
(Mukat-atmic shabad)
( Soundless sound )
```

```
18 Sahib Bandgi
```
**concentration at musical sounds will ultimately be
devoured by Niranjan. But, he who fixes his
concentration at soundless sound will escape from the
grip of Kal.**
There are Dhuns (musical sounds) inside us.
Some call these Dhuns as Surti Shabad Abhyas (Practice
of concentrating one’s surti in musical sounds) as well
& get lost in them. Some call these musical sounds as
God. But these can’t help one to go beyond the state
of Turiateet (one of the four states of mind). This is
because these Dhuns have their own limits & get
destroyed after some definite period. Then what kind
of a word it is! That is to say, it is neither the musical
sound nor the speakable one.
_So to shabad videh_
**That word is beyond form & formless.**
Sahibji says that the real Shabad (word) is a
soundless sound.
_Do bin hoye na adhar awaza._
**The sound can’t be produced without the presence
of two.**
And where there is sound, there is the presence
of Maya.
_Hadd tappe so Auliyan, be hadd tappe so Peer.
Hadd-be-hadd donon tappe, tiska nam Kabir._
**He who crosses the limit is called as a Sage; he who
crosses the limitless is called as a Peer while he who
crosses both—the limit as well as the limitless—is
known by the name of Kabir.**
But, Kabir Sahib talked about Pra Bhakti that is


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 19
```
far beyond from these two. Dadu Dayal ji said—
_Koyi sargun mein reejh raha, koyi nirgun thahraye.
Dadu atpat chal Kabir ki, mosey kahi na jaye.
Hindu to hadd mein chaley, Musalman hadd par.
Dadu chal Kabir ki, mosey kahi na jaye._
**Dadu Dayal ji says that people are engaged
in Sargun (with form) or Nirgun (formless)
kinds of worshipps & seems to be satisfied
with such worshipps. But, Kabirji’s
philosophy is altogether different from these
& is indescribable. The Hindus remain
within their limits while the Muslims cross
these limits. But, Kabir Sahib shows the rare
path to be followed.**
All the spiritual saints of the past agreed to His
views & principles without any controversy. He
touched every aspect of human life with great caution.
In a very simple way he told everyone about the
principles of easy meditation that they could practise
even in their household to realise the ultimate reality.
He spoke in the language of the common masses about
the ways that could help a devotee to open his/her
Sushumna Narhi (nerve) (inbetween the two nostrils)
& can see the whole universe inside their body.
_Kheil brahmand ka pind mein dekhya,
jagat ki bharmna door bhagi.
Bahra bheetra ek aakashwat,
sushumna dore tah palat lagi.
Pawan ko palat ker shunya mein ghar kiya,
dhar aur adhar mein bharpoor dekha._


**20 Sahib Bandgi**

```
Kahey kabir guru poorey ki mehar se,
trikuti madhya deedar dekha.
Dekh deedar mast hoye rahun,
sakal bharpoor hai noor tera.
Subhag dariyav jahan hans moti chugey,
kal ka jal tahan nahin tera.
Geyan ka thal au sahaj mati path hai,
dhar aur adhar mein agam kiya dera.
Kahey Kabir tahan brahm bhasai nahin,
avagaman ka mita phera.
In order to make the worldly people
understand the rare secrets Kabir Sahib says,
“I have seen all the happenings in the whole
of the cosmos within myself. It has cleared
all my doubts about the universe. The same
things are happening within & outside the
physical body. By reversing the process of
breathing I made it move towards
Sushumana & was able to have self
realisation. I was charmed to see His vision
& found that it is His light that is to be
found anywhere & everywhere. In a
beautiful river I found the Hansas enjoying
supreme pleasures. This place was away
from the reach of Kal. The way to reach
this place is a very easy one. There is no
deception of any kind to be found there.
And I was able to free myself from the cycle
of repeated births & deaths.”
```

**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 21**
These words take one to pure spiritual world. You
can see that a high place has been given to the sayings
of Kabir Sahib ji in Shri Guru Granth Sahib. About
Kabir Sahib ji, Dadu Dayal Ji has said—
_Ketey santa koop kai, ketey sarita neer.
Dadu agam athah hai, dariya satya Kabir._
**Dadu Dayalji says that there are many
saints who are like the water of the well or
the river. But, it is not possible to reach the
depths of Kabir Sahib ji.**
He who in Kalyug is with the Jivatma, destroys
sins in the guise of knowledge (Bodh), is to be found
in the hearts of all, is called by the name of Kabir.
_Bani arab va kharabloun, granthaan koti hazar.
Karta purush Kabir hai, Nabhey kiya vichar.
—Sant Nabha Dass ji_
**Saint Nabha Dassji says that the study of
countless sayings of saints & the holy
scriptures can’t enable us to achieve
liberation. It is only Kabir Sahib ji who can
show us the path in this regard.**
_Avval sant Kabir hai, dooje Ramanand,
tasey bhakti pragat hui, saat deep nav khand.
Yak araj guftam pesh, tu darr gosh kun Kartar.
Hakka Kabir Karim tu, be aib Paravardigar.
—Guru Nanak Dev ji_
**Guru Nanak Devji says that Kabir Sahib
ji is the greatest saint while Rama Nandji**


**22 Sahib Bandgi**

```
occupies the second place & it is through
these two saints that the mode of worship
spread everywhere. He also describes Kabir
Sahib as the flawless Supreme Lord.
Kabir karta aap hai, dooja nahin koye.
Dadu puran jagat ko, bhakti daridavan soye.
—Dadu Dayal ji
Dadu Dayalji says that none but Kabir
Sahib ji is the real doer and that it is only he
who showed all the path of real Bhakti.
Dadu nam Kabir ka, jo koyi levey oat.
Usko kabhi na lagsi, kal bajar ki choat.
—Dadu Dayal ji
He says that Kal can’t do any harm to a
devotee who gets blessed with the holy Nam
of Kabir Sahib.
Jaise badal gagan mein, chalte hain bin panv.
Aise purush kabir hain, shunya mein rahey smav.
—Garib Dassji
Garib Dassji says that just as the clouds
in sky move without feet, Kabir Sahib ji
also moves about freely in Shunya (vaccum).
Gagan mandal se utrey, Sahib Purush Kabir.
Chola dhara khwas (Sewak) ka, torhe yam zanjeer.
—Garib Dass ji
He says that Kabir Sahib ji descended down
from the sky, disguised himself as a devotee
& broke the complete network of Kal.
```

**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 23**
Sayings of these saints & others clearly show that
Kabir Sahib ji was not a human being. Usually, every
one praises & speaks high of His own deity, but there
is some weightage & depth in that what I stress. Just
be clean at heart & think in an impartial manner!
Kabir Sahib ji knew that the people had created many
misuderstandings about his birth. So He decided to
tell the world about his true identity before His
departure from this world. As you know that He
incarnated Himself in the guise of a human being on
the full moon day of Jyeshat Sudhi (a great day falling
on mid of May) in the year 1398. When, after
preaching Satya Bhakti in the world for 120 years,
He had to go to His original abode, He declared that
he would depart from the world on Magh Sudhi
Ekadshi (An auspicious day falling on the next day of
Lohri festival) in the year 1518 at Maghar. On hearing
his declaration lakhs of people gathered at Maghar.
Among them there were many prominent disciples
including king Veer Singh Waghel of Kashi, Nawab
Bijli Khan Pathan of Awadh & many others who
wanted to see all this. King Veer Singh ordered his
commander-in-chief to take the dead body of Kabir
Sahib ji, after the latter’s departure from this world, to
Kashi so that he could build a Samadhi (Trance) after
performing the last rites as per the Hindu tradition.
On hearing this, Bijli Khan Pathan said that he won’t
allow such a thing to happen because Kabir Sahib ji
was his guru and he would build a mausoleum after


```
24 Sahib Bandgi
```
performing the last rites as per the muslim tradition.
Both of them took out their swords & were
prepared to fight against each other. In the meantime,
there appeared a wonderful light from the sky with a
sound —
_Uthawo parda nahin hai murda,
Aey rey murakh nadana, tumne humko nahin pahchana._
**Then there was a word from the sky in
which Kabir Sahib said to them, “Lift the
sheet & see it for yourself, there is no dead
body beneath it. It is foolish on your part
that you have not recognised my true
identity.”**
When parda (white cloth Sheet) was removed,
there was no dead body of Kabir Sahib. There were
only the flowers of lotus. Kabir Sahib performed this
miracle in front of lakhs of people next to prove the
reality about His own identity. The Hindus took the
flowers & built a Smadhi while the Muslims took the
sheet & built a Mazar (Mausoleum). These two even
today bear witness to the fact that Kabir Sahib was
not a human being. He was rather Param Purush
Himself (Supreme Lord). Just think over the truth &
knowledge contained in my reasoning. None before
that had departed from the world alongwith his body.
This is in itself the first and the last miracle that Sahib
ji displayed before the people. His sayings will ever
remain a source of guidance to the people in their
path of realising God. The preachings of Kabir Sahib
ji will always remain useful for the humanity in


```

showing up the path of peace & truth and above all
the true salvation.

**All the Saints have said

THE REAL FACE OF
```
**SANT-MAT**

All the people generally try to associate themselves
with the thing, person or place which shoots into
prominence at any given time.
If we look at the world of today, even a small
child who finds it difficult to hold a bat, thinks himself
as Sachin Tendulkar. Sachin has, no doubt, risen to a
high position. Even a duplicate copy of him has come
into appearance. He looks like him in form but has
no idea about the technique of cricket.
We has also come to occupy a place of prominence.
We can find many wrestlers with names of Stone Cold,
Rock or the Undertaker.
It is the very nature of man to seek opportunity
to rise at the highest position. If he is not in a position
to attain success by fair means, he doesn’t hesitate to
use all possible foul means to do so. And many a times
he succeeds in it.
There was a time when the Brahmins occupied a
high status in the society. The people had a great regard
for them & were even afraid of causing annoyance to
them for one reason or other. All of us know that
religious tolerance has been a special feature of

```
28
```

```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 29
```
Hinduism. Taking advantage of this tolerance, many
Kashatriyas, Vaishyas & Shudras (class of warriors,
traders & small workers) also adopted Brahmanism.
In Kushan Kal we find a mention that many
foreigners taking advantage of this tolerance became
Brahmins.
In the field of business we often find that when a
thing of some quality gains recognition and
importance, it begins to flood the markets. At first,
the rate of such a thing is somewhat higher, but
gradually its price begins to decline. We also know
the reason thereof. The thing that makes its appearance
in the beginning is no more to be seen afterwards.
Instead, only the new version has either the original
stamp or is only a duplicate of it that other companies
brought into the market realising its huge sales.
In the world of today, the saints have gained high
status. There was a time, when they had to face strong
opposition. It was the time when Satguru Kabir Sahib
had ushered in a new era of Sant-Mat.
_‘Balihari guru aapno, jin Govind diyo bataye.’_
**Kabir Sahib ji had forcefully popularised
Sant-Mat with the slogan ‘‘I surrender
myself before the guru who enabled me to
have a vision of God (Param Purush).”**
With these words he had described guru as a
medium of realization of God. Later on when the
saints were elevated to the highest status, many religious
persons practising Karam Kands became gurus. Some


**30 Sahib Bandgi**
became gurus to earn bread & butter while others did
so to earn name & fame. Not only satisfied with this,
they even began to use the surname ‘Sant’ with their
name.
In the present times, there are about 60 Lac
registered gurus & many more unregistered as well. It
throws ample light on the importance of the sayings
of holy saints.
The present age is the age of science. Man is
performing great miracles in various fields of life. All
this is the result of his brain & reasoning power. But it
is sad to note that the intellectuals of today have failed
to know the guidelines & teachings of the saints who
came prior to us. They have failed to know the ways
& means described by them for the realization of
God. They have failed to know whether the saints of
today are preaching the same teachings & telling the
same path of God realization. Infact, there has been
great deviation from the past. Even inspite of great
momentum in the religious field, we find that the
Sant-Mat itself is eloping from this world. Every
religious person is today trying to associate himself
with the teachings of Sant-Mat & this has somewhat
hidden the real face of Sant-Mat. Some confusion
seems to have been created. The importance of saints
has also lessened to a great extent.
If the teachers engaged in the teaching of children
in schools start using the surname ‘Doctor’ with their
name, the doctor will no doubt remains a doctor, but


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 31
```
the importance of doctors will definately falls in the
eyes of children. The same is happening with the Sant-
Mat today. Where has the Sant-Mat gone? It seems to
have disappeared. Only the stamp of Sant-Mat seems
to have survived. There is an urgent need to know the
Sant-Mat in its right context. We have forgotten Guru
Nanak Dev ji, Sant Ravi Dass ji & other saints.
Today, even the idol worshippers associate
themselves with the Sant-Mat. Many others including
those associated with Sargun Bhakti, Nirgun Bhakti
also do the same. It is this approach that has eclipsed
the real face of Sant-Mat. A coating of Pakhand
(hypocrisy) has appeared on its surface.
Can we worship God through the medium of idol
worship? Not only Sant-Mat but even different
religious scriptures refuse to agree to it.
According to Rigved— The worship of God is to
be done in an open & natural environment.
The thinking power of man begins to retard
within the boundary walls of temples. The highest
place for God worship is the soul of human being
itself that resides within each of us.
Saints believe that it is not possible to worship
God through an idol because it is not possible to
picture the real appearance of God through it. Even
the imagination of a person finds its reflection in the
formation of an idol & thus perfection can never be
expected. Not only this much, even a fellow who has
had a vision of God, can’t bring perfection in the idol


**32 Sahib Bandgi**
if he attempts to make one. One whose virtues can’t
be expressed in words, can in no way be put inside an
idol. Idol worship can’t show the real path to a devotee.
An idol can’t give any knowledge or advice to a devotee.
It can neither scold nor give any punishment to a
wrong doer. One is free to do as one likes. Many
Mahatmas of modern times are just like idols. They
talk like great intellectuals but their disciples are
engrossed in vices, like lust, anger, greed, use of
intoxicants etc.
The Mahatmas see all this but never scold them
perhaps out of fear that their disciples will desert them
& seek the shelter of some other guru and this will cut
their source of income. On the other hand, in Sant-
Mat a perfect Satguru guides his disciples in sleep as
well as in awakened state. These disciples receive deep
& higher knowledge from the Satguru. They are also
reprimanded & scolded by the Guru for any mistake
they commit. This is done to prevent them from
repeating the mistakes. Repetition of mistakes can
invite punishment as well. In this way devotion to
Satguru is of great help in removing the vices.
The aim of Sahib Bandgi is not to denounce idol
worship. There is no opposition to it. This Issue has
been raised to throw light on the real nature of Sant-
Mat & to make it clear that in Sant-Mat the worship
& devotion to Guru, instead of idol worship, is the
real path to reach upto the truth. _i.e._ to attain true
salvation.


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 33**
Sant-Mat is different from Yog Mat as well. In
Sant-Mat Yog & Bhog have been placed in one
category. The only difference is that lust is associated
with our physical organs while Yog is associated with
our ethereal organs. One filled with lust enjoys physical
organs in five ways.
He does so through mouth, nose, ears, eyes &
penis. On the other hand, a Yogi derives pleasures from
ethereal cells in five ways. He rises far above the
pleasures that can be derived from physical organs.
Infact, a yogi awakens the dormant cells through the
medium of meditation & derives great pleasures. That
is why the yogis develop a liking forsome lonely place
away from the world. They feel no need for the
pleasures of the material objects of the world which
seems to appear charmless to them. The source from
which yogis derive pleasures is of the following five
kinds—
In the first kind, a Yogi concentrates at a point in
between the two eyes. In Yogic terminology it is called
as Chachri Mudra They make a practise over the word
Jyoti Niranjan, the source of production of fire (Agni
Tattav). This Mudra helps the yogi to awaken his
dormant cells & enables him to have a vision of a
wonderful light that proves a source of strange
pleasures to him. Gradually he begins to experience
the hidden powers. He rises far higher than ordinary
human beings. Concentration at this point, in between
the two eyes, makes the region so glaring that an


```
34 Sahib Bandgi
```
ordinary man can’t even look into his eyes. In this
connection Kabir Sahib ji says—
_Jyoti niranjan chachri mudra, so hai nainan mahi.
Tehi ko jana gorakh yogi, maha tej hai tahi._
**In Chachri Mudra a yogi fixes his
concentration at a point in between two eyes
& recites the word ‘Jyoti Niranjan’. Among
such Yogis Gorakh Nath was the first to have
a complete understanding of this posture.**
The worldly pleasures cease to have any attraction
for him. He goes in search of some lonely place. Just
as a worldly man seeks some lonely place for worldly
pleasures, a yogi also moves far away from the worldly
people to enjoy the pleasures. The latter tries to remain
engrossed in these pleasures at all the time. Sometimes
the worldly people think that the Sanyasis don’t know
the worldly pleasures, but the position is just the reverse.
It is only on realizing the sorrows & sufferings of the
world that they move in search of pleasures & having
found them, remain absorbed in them. The worldly
people can’t even imagine such pleasures as their
imagination is limited to the pleasures of heaven alone,
while the pleasures derived by a yogi are far greater
than those of heaven.
In the second kind, a yogi concentrates his
attention on the sounds being produced within him.
It is also called as Agochari Mudra, and make a practise
over the word ‘Sohang’, the source of production of
air (Vaju Tattav). Aa means ‘no’ ‘Go’ means organs &


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 35
```
‘char’ means to be visible, that is, the path that is not
visible to the organs. In this Mudra as well, the yogi
can’t have a vision of anything. He listens to these
sounds, concentrates his attention on them and enters
the Bhanwar Gufa through these sounds. These sounds
give much energy to the yogi. Moreover, on entering
into the Bhanwar Gufa, he attains some siddhies
(miraculous powers) as well. Kabir Sahib ji says—
_Sohang shabd agochari mudra, bhanwar gufa asthana.
Shukdev ta ko pahichana, suni anhad ki tana._
**In Agochri Mudra a yogi fixes his
concentration at the musical sounds
emanating from within Bhanwar Gufa &
recites the word ‘Sohang’. Among such
Yogis Shuk Dev was the first to have a
complete under-standing of this posture.**
These words & sounds are so melodious & sweet
that on hearing them a devotee desires to listen to
them again & again. The worldly people make
payment & listen to the music while the yogis do so
without paying any money. Also, the music the yogis
listen to, is so sweet that they try to move away from
the worldly music & seek some lonely place. The
words of this music are called as ‘Anhad’. Some people
take these words as God. Kabir Sahib ji has never called
them as God. He says—
_Jap marey ajapa marey, anhad bhi mar jaye.
Surti smani Shabd mein, usko Kal na khaye._
**Kabir Sahib says that a devotee who
recites ‘Nam’ with the movement of mouth**


**36 Sahib Bandgi
falls a prey to Kal. And the one in whose
interior the recitation of ‘Nam’ goes on
automatically, also falls a prey to Kal. Even
he who meditates on the musical sounds
within also meets the same fate. But he
whose concentration gets absorbed in ‘Saar
Shabad’, (Sound less sound) escapes from
the clutches of Kal.**
In order to enjoy worldly music it is necessary to
have a knowledge of that music. For example, if a
person has no knowledge of Shastriya Sangeet, he can’t
derive joy out of it. But no such knowledge is needed
to enjoy the inner music. It provides the same kind of
pleasure to all the practitioners.
Listening to the worldly music gives a kind of
pleasure to those who have some knowledge of it. They
get absorbed in that. If any of them listens to the inner
music, he will find all the external music as useless.
In the third kind, a yogi takes to the chanting of
Onkar. It is also called as Bhuchri Mudra, and make a
practise of word Onkar, the source of production of
water (Jal Tattav). A yogi concentrates his attention at
Aagya Chakra in the centre right of the forehead. This
Mudra is more beneficial than the first two so far as
the question of attaining pleasures & powers is
concerned. Kabir Sahib says—
_Ao onkar bhuchari mudra, trikuti hai asthaana.
Vyasdev ta ko pehchana, chand surya so jana._
**In Bhuchari Mudra a yogi fixes his
concentration at a point in the middle of**


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 37
forehead & recites the word ‘Onkar (Aum)’.
Among such Yogis Vyas Dev was the first
to have a complete understanding of this
posture.**
In the fourth kind, a yogi concentrates his
attention at Sahastarsar Chakra and recite over the
word ‘Satt’ which is also called as Unmuni Mudra, the
source of production of earth (Prithvi Tattav). It is the
place where the ladies apply vermilion (Sindoor). On
concentrating at this point one has a vision of
wonderful light. A devotee experiences great powers.
He can rise above in a formless manner. In this context
Kabir Sahib says—
_Satt shabd so unmuni mudra, soi aakash snehi.
Ta may jhil mil jyoti dikhavey, jana janak vidhehi._
**In Unmuni Mudra a yogi fixes his
concentration at the place where the ladies
apply vermilion & recites the word ‘Satt’.
Among such Yogis King Janak was the first
to have a complete understanding of this
posture.**
The pleasure a devotee derives in such a kind of
meditation is far greater than that derived in the first
three kinds of Mudras. This is because in this Mudra a
yogi, even while living in the body, remains ignorant
about the activities of the body.
In the fifth kind, a yogi concentrates his attention
at Khechri Mudra and make a practice of word R-Rankar,
the source of sky (Aakash Tattav). This kind of
meditation enables the yogi to pass through the 10th


```
38 Sahib Bandgi
```
dwara which is in the Sushumna nerve. The path
followed by all the yogis is the same, but there is
variation of limits. After passing through the 10th
dwara a yogi can come & go into the universe where
he likes. Such a yogi attains a wonderful body that
enables him to visit innumerable Brahmands
(Universes). The pleasures derived by him are far
superior to those derived by other yogis. Satguru Kabir
Sahib says—
_R-rankar khechri mudra, daswan dwar thikana.
Brahma vishnu maheshwar deva, r-rankar pahichana.
Panch shabad aur pancho mudra, soi nishchay kar mana.
Aage pooran purush puratan, tinki khabar na jana._
**In Khechri Mudra a yogi fixes his
concentration at the 10th dwara—a zero
state that emerges during meditation & if
the yogi goes beyond that state, it is said
that the 10th dwara has got opened. (It is
not a particular point within the body)) &
recites the word ‘R-Rankar’. Among such
Yogis the three gods—Brahma, Vishnu &
Mahesh have the complete understanding
of this posture. But, Sahib ji says that the
each yogi took that which he attained
through any of these postures & words as
the ultimate reality. But, none could know
of the Param Purush (Supreme Lord) who
is far beyond these limits.**
Just as in sexual act one derives the greatest possible
pleasure from the related nerve, in yogic activity the


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 39
```
greatest pleasure is derived from the 10th dwara. Kabir
Sahib ji talks of something that is further beyond from it.
_Panch shabd brahm sarupa,
Ta ke aage nam anupa._
**All these five words are the different
forms of Brahm (Niranjan) alone. But the
rare & real ‘Nam’ is far beyond these.**
But, the mater that deserves our attention is that
the pleasures the saints have talked about are not related
to the 10th dwara. It is rather the pleasures of the
11th dwara that they have talked about.
_Nau dwara sansar sabh, daswain yogi saadh.
Ekadash khirhki bani, janat sant sujan._
**Whole of the world has knowledge of
the nine dwaras (apertures) only. It is only
the yogis who can reach to the 10th aperture
as well. But the 11th aperture that lies
beyond the 10th one is known to the saints
alone.**
This is the real pleasure that all try to seek but it is
some rare ones who enjoy it by the grace of Satguru.
What does this real pleasure mean? Just as the lion in
the cage as well as the one in the forest eat meat, but
there is a great difference in the pleasures derived by
the two. Likewise, there is a lot of difference in the
pleasures derived by a yogi and a Sant. Also, the
pleasures derived by a yogi are short lived. All the
pleasures of yogis are that derived from the ethereal
cells & among these the pleasures derived from


**40 Sahib Bandgi**
Sushumna nerve are the greatest ones. Kabir, while
apprising the yogis of their temporary pleasures, said
that their Sushumna nerve will also get destroyed along
with the destruction of their body & asked them where
they would fix their concentration then? In Kabir Sagar
one finds—
_Sidh sadhu trideva aadi ley,
panch shabad mein atkey.
Mudra saadhi rahe ghat bheetar,
phir aundhey munh latke._
**Kabir Sahib ji says that Sidhs, Sadhus
including Tridev (Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesh) in the past times remained
entangled within the limit of 5 words
mentioned before. They fixed
concentration through the said postures but
had come once again to hang upside down
in the womb of their mothers.**
A yogi remains absorbed in awakening the ethereal
cells but all his play comes to an end with the death of
the Sushumna nerve. The very source of his pleasure
is gone. He has to take birth again to reap the fruit of
his deeds. So Kabir Sahib says—
_Daswein dwar se jeev jabb jayi,
swarg lok mein vasa payi.
Geyarhavein dwar se pran nikasa,
amar lok mein paye vasa._
**If the vital force escapes through the 10th
dwara, the jiva attains heaven. But the jiva**


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 41
attains Amarlok only if this vital force
escapes through the 11th aperture.**
A saint instead of awakening the ethereal cells of
the body awakens the soul. Just as stated above, the
limit of a yogi is upto the 10th dwara only, whereas a
saint has the power to go out of the limit of 11th
dwara as well. After all, what do these 10th dwara &
11th dwara stand for? Going out of the 10th dwara
means going out of Maya—(Body) whereas going out
of the 11th dwara means to go out of the grip of Mind.
Maya is the body whereas Mind is the Brahmand.
A yogi moves out of Maya, wanders in Munn
(Nirakar) and considers himself as liberated. In Kabir
Sagar we find—
_Panch shabd pancho mudra, lok deep yam jala._
**All the five postures & five words
including all the Lokas one can attain
through these are nothing but the network
of Kal Niranjan.**
If thought wisely, everyone moves out of Maya
for sometime at the time of death. But he can’t liberate
himself as the Munn throws him into Maya as & when
it finds time. So every Jeev comes out of Maya many
a times but is again thrown into it. In the same manner,
a yogi also comes out of Maya for sometime only &
not for ever. On the contrary, a true saint moves out
of Maya & Munn for ever. Having come out of the
limit of Munn, he doesn’t return to Maya again.
It is not the aim of Sahib Bandgi to denounce
Yog Mat. A Yogi also goes in search of different ways


```
42 Sahib Bandgi
```
& means to seek God & is as such a devotee far ahead
of an ordinary devotee of Sargun Bhakti. This is
because he renunciates the world & controls his desires
in order to realise God. So the yogis have in no way
been denounced. Here only an attempt has been made
to caution the devotees (who desire to attain true
pleasures) against those who inspite of being yogis try
knowingly or unknowingly to associate themselves
with Sant-Mat. Also, attempt has been made to
differentiate between the Sant-Mat & the Yog Mat.
In Sant-Mat a disciple concentrates his attention
on Guru & through the medium of the latter realises
God. Now a question that can arise in the mind of
any devotee is whether a Guru is immortal? Then how
can one realise God through the medium of Guru.
In fact, a Sant Satguru is not a body. He is a true
Satguru in a body. Residing in human body he shows
the real path to a disciple & at the time of blessing the
disciple with Nam, fixes his attention with the sound
of his (guru’s) Shabd (sacred word). He gives the
disciple a Godly power in the form of Nam which is,
infact, His greatest blessing on the latter. This is because
this Holy Nam acts like a ship to take the disciple out
of the worldly ocean. It takes him to his real & true
abode _i.e._ Amarlok (4th Lok) safe & sound.
The soul has forgotten its true abode & has got
entangled in the unreal world of mind. If even
unknowingly it tries to go to its real abode, the devil
Munn (mind) pulls it back. That is why inspite of all


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 43
```
earnest efforts the jeev can’t get salvation without the
aid of a true Satguru. But on seeking the shelter of a
true Satguru, the Godly power of Nam, in front of
which the evil power of Munn (mind) fails, takes jiva
to its real abode where it can achieve true pleasures.
In the Ramayana, at one place we find that
Hanuman ji of his own accord gets into the bondage
of Megh Nath. He does so in order to meet Ravna. In
the palace of Ravan he says— **Ravan, it is a matter of
sorrow that I have no permission of Sri Ram. If I had
it, I would have killed you alongwith your army &
have drowned Lanka in sea would have taken Sita ji
along with me.** No doubt, Hanuman ji had the power
to take Sita ji out of the palace of Ravan. There was
none to stop him. Likewise, a true Sant can kill
Kalpurush to take all the jivas (souls) out of three lok’s
to Amarlok, but Parampurush has not given the
permission for the same as it would amount to a breach
of the promise made to Nirankar or Kal Purush
(Niranjan).
In reality, words fail to explain the power of a
true Saint. But, the sorrowful thing is that we lack the
power to recognise a true Sant. In general, we take
the person with 1½ft. long beard, 2 ft. of mated hair
(Jatayen), 3ft. long dhoti (a cloth for wrapping the
body below navel) & saffron dress as a Sant. Every
sadhu can’t be called as sadhu because one doesn’t
become a sadhu by wearing a particular kind of dress
alone. Just as we see many people with no connection


```
44 Sahib Bandgi
```
with any sport, wandering about in track suits. Many
people who are unable to hold even a bat properly are
seen wandering in cricket suits bearing the names of
Sachin or Saurav. Likewise, many sadhus who don’t
know even the panth to which they belong & the way
they meditate on God, can be seen wandering in our
country. They wander only to satisfy their hunger. In
this connection, Kabir Sahib ji has said—
_Pait ke karan karey gurwayi,
peerhi sahit narak mein jayi._
**He who adopts the profession of a guru
for the sake of earning his bread and butter,
goes to hell alongwith his family &
forefathers.**
In the whole of world WWE (Free style wrestling)
has gained popularity. In our country as well we can
find some small wrestlers who don’t show their real
identity. They consider themselves as Stone Cold,
Rock, The Undertaker etc. Infact, they have become
fans to such an extent that they have forgotten their
own identity & keep repeating the names of the
wrestlers whose fans they are. When someone tries to
know their good name, they, instead of telling their
own name, speaks out the names of those wrestlers.
Such a desire is also to be seen in the religious field as
well. In the whole of India, the huge gatherings of
people that we see in the field of Bhakti are solely due
to their devotion towards Saints.


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 45**
Today, the people have become great fans of saints.
It is as a result of this devotion of the people towards
Saints that even small sadhus, irrespective of their mode
of worship, like to be called as Saints.
Today, when we go to bazzar to buy some valuable
thing, we are not fully sure as to whether we shall be
able to get the original one or not. We are forced to
accept the duplicate one if we don’t have the ability to
recognise the original one.
Likewise, we can seek the shelter of a true Satguru
only when we have some idea or means to recognise
him. But how & from whom can we learn the
technique to do so. Just as we can get information
about some wrestler from a wrestler & about some
batsman or a bowler from a cricketer, we can do the
same in case of a Satguru as well. Seeing the style &
way of walking of a person, a wrestler can recognise
that the person concerned is a wrestler. Then on seeing
his tactics in wrestling, he can at once guess the status
of that wrestler. Likewise, on seeing a batsman or a
bowler trying to trun his hands in a particular way, a
cricketer can judge that the person concerned is a
cricketer. And after seeing his play in the field, he at
once guesses the status he occupies in the field of cricket.
In the same manner, it is a Saint alone who can tell us
about the real identity of a true Satguru. Has any Saint
told the identity of a true Satguru? Yes, His holiness
Sant Kabir ji Maharaj has done so. Other Sant have
also accepted the same. Kabir ji has described seven
features of a true Satguru.


**46 Sahib Bandgi
First feature :** The first & the foremost feature of
a true Satguru is that he should be a Bal Brahmchari
( _i.e._ never indulged in sexual acts right from the
childhood). He should have no sexual contacts with
any woman. If he is not a Brahmchari, he should be
one who severs relations with his family before
assuming the role of a Satguru. A Bal Brahmchari is
considered as a learned person from the very beginning
because he has never fallen into the grip of Maya.
_Geyan chadariya jisne leeni, maili ker dhar deeni.
Ek kabir jatan se leeni, jyun ki tayun dar deeni._
**All those who wrapped the sheet of
knowledge (in the form of human body)
made it unclean by indulging in lustful
activities. But it is only Kabir Sahib who
maintained its purity & dignity.**
Marriage means attaining sexual pleasures. And
how can a person indulged in seeking sexual pleasures
prove to be a true guru. Such a guru has not so far
tasted the true spiritual pleasures & as such can’t be
expected to make his disciples realise the true pleasures
that are far beyond from the sexual ones. In this
connection Kabir Sahib ji says—
_Jaka guru hai greehi, girhi chela hoye.
Keech keech ke dhovte, daag na chhute koye._
**A disciple whose guru is a family holder,
will also become a family holder like his
guru. The stains of mud can’t be removed
by mud itself. That is to say, such a guru**


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 47
won’t be able to show the path of true
Bhakti to his disciples.**
That is why Sahibji says that if a person fails to
seek a Bal Brahmchari Guru, he should seek a guru
who has become Sanyasi on becoming enlightened &
not on attaining guru Gaddi (succession as a guru). It
is very much necessary to refrain from sexual desires
& pleasures much before assuming the role of a
Satguru. Guru Nanak Dev ji has also said—
_Yeh duniya sakli tajee, liya vesh vairag.
Kahu nanak sun re mana, ta ghat brahm niwas._
**Guru Nanak Devji says that Param
Purush can show his appearance only within
a devotee who leaves aside the worldly
attachments & takes to Vairagya
(renunciation).
2nd feature :** The other main feature in this line is
that of non-attachment. It means he should have no
relation with his brothers, sisters, sons, daughters etc.
That is to say he should have no special love &
attachment for them. He should have relation with
his disciples alone. If he has special attachment with
his family members, he will utilise the money recieved
from his disciples for their welfare rather than for the
welfare of people. Apart from it, he will behave in a
partial manner in the time to come & will hand over
the Guru Gaddi to his son or to one among his nears
& dears regardless of the fact whether such a person is
fit for the same or not. In this connection Kaibir Sahib
ji has said—


**48 Sahib Bandgi**
_Beej bindd nahin chaley guruvai.
Naad bindd se chaley guruvayi._
**Kabir Sahib says that succession of a guru
takes place on the basis of Shabad Puttra
(who is blessed with Nam) excluding his
son even if he is blessed with Nam.**
It means the Guru Gaddi should be kept away from
the access of near & dear ones. The very feeling of my
son, my daughter, my brother, my sister etc. is
attachment. The job of a guru is to take the soul of the
disciple to its original & real abode that is far removed
from the Moh-Maya. How can a guru be expected to
perform this noble job if he himself is entangled in the
grip of Moh-Maya (materialistic world).
_Bandhey ko bandha mila, chhutey kaun upaye.
Ker sewa nir bandh ki, pal mein ley chhurhaye._
**One who himself is in bondage can’t be
expected to remove the bondage of any
other. That is why Kabir Sahib admonishes
us to seek the shelter of such a guru who is
free from any sort of worldly attachments.
Such a guru will enable you to seek
liberation within a moment.
3rd feature:** The third important feature is to be
Sargrahi. That is to say he should be self dependent &
should not depend on others for his bread & butter.
In a beautiful manner Paltoo Sahib has said—
_Mer javun mangoo nahin, apne tann ke kaj.
Parmarth ke kaj mein, mohe na aawe laj._


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 49
Paltoo Sahibji says that he won’t beg for
the sake of his body. But he won’t feel
ashamed in begging for the good of others.**
Kabir Sahib ji has given a piece of advice—
_Mangan maran sman hai, matt koyi mangey bhikh.
Mangan te marna bhala, yeh Satguru ki seekh._
**Kabir Sahib says that begging is just like
dying. So none should beg. He furthur says
that it is better to die than to beg. This is
the advice that Satguru gives.
Fourth feature:** The fourth feature is that a guru
should not be greedy. He should have no love for the
money which the disciples have.
**Fifth feature:** The fifth feature is that he should be
true & unselfish. The Sant have regarded truthfullness
as the basis of all the religions.
_Sanch brabar tapp nahin, jhuth brabar pap.
Ja ke hridey sanch hai, ta ke hridey aap._
**Kabir Sahib ji says that no sort of worship
can match truthfullness & there is no sin as
great as falsehood. Param Purush resides only
in the hearts of such devotees who are truthful.**
To realise that truth Sahib ji has laid stress on the
truthfullness of Guru, Shishya & Nam.
_Guru satya nam satya ho, aap satya jo hoye.
Teen satya jabb ek haun, vish se amrit hoye._
**Kabir Sahib ji says that if all the three— the
Guru, Nam & disciple are truthfull, even the**


**50 Sahib Bandgi
poison turns into nector. That is to say, the
realization of ultimate reality (Supreme Lord)
becomes possible.**
Alongwith being lover of truth, the Guru should
be one who serves the society in an unselfish manner.
**Sixth feature:** The sixth feature is that he should
have a knowledge of all the religious scriptures. It is
through this knowledge alone that he will be able to
clear the doubts of his disciples.
**7th feature:** The greatest & most important feature
of a Satguru is that his Atma (soul) should be in union
with the God. A guru who possesses the first six features
can be expected to possess the seventh one as well.
Many Mahatmas talk of true Nam & Param Dham
but don’t go beyond Shunya (Niranjan) & three lokas.
They are describing the inner light, the sun, the moon,
the stars & Anhad Dhuns (musical sounds) alone as
Paramatma. Kabir Sahib has described all this as a mere
show of Kal.
_Anhad ki dhun bhanvar gufa mein,
ati ghanghor machaya hai.
Baje bajey anek bhanti ke,
suni ke munn lalchaya hai.
.... ..... ..... .... .... ....
Yeh sab kal jal ko phanda,
munn kalipat thahraya jai._
**Kabir Sahib says that there is great noise
of all sorts of musical sounds within the
Bhanwar Gufa. The beatings of musical
bands of different varieties attract ones
mind to their sweet & charming tunes. But,
all this is the play of Niranjan to keep jiva
(soul) entangled.**


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 51**
Kabir Sahib ji has furthur said—
_Panch shabad aur panchon mudra,
Lok deep yam jala._
**All the five postures & five words
including all the Lokas one can attain
through these are nothing but the network
of Kal (Niranjan).**
Even after realizing all this, if the Munn (mind) is
out of control, rest assured you have not been blessed
with the true Nam. After the true Nam a great power
becomes your companion. This power guides you in
your sleep as well as in your awakened state. Seeing
your devotion & firm faith it brings a sea change in
you. Guru Nanak Dev ji has said in this connection—
_Khinn mein karhve ho gaye, jitne maya bhog._
**Guru Nanak Dev ji says that all the
worldly dishes began to taste bitter soon
after getting blessed with the holy Nam.**
If nothing happens like that.....About a Guru,
Kabir Sahib ji says—
_Jabh takk guru miley nahin sancha,
tabh takk guru karo das pancha._
**Kabir Sahib ji says that a devotee can seek
the shelter of different gurus as long as he
is able to seek some true Satguru.**
The possession of all the above said features is a
touchstone for a true Sant Satguru. If such a sant is
the mirror of Paramatma, undoubtedly, the panth
‘Sahib Bandgi is the mirror of such a Satguru.

```
The Formless ‘Nam’
from Amarlok
```
_Kaya nam sabhin gun gavai, vidhey nam koyi birla pavai.
Videh nam pavey ga soyi, jiska Satguru sancha hoyi._
**Everyone is singing in praise of Nam with some definite
form but it is only some rare one who attains the formless
Nam. And only a devotee, who has sought the shelter of
some true Satguru, can attain this bodiless Nam.**
_Panch teen adheen kaya, neyar shabad videh ho.
Surti manhi videh darshai, guru mata nij eh ho._
**The five words and the three gunas are all within the authority
of Kal, but the rare Nam is bodiless. The Satguru is of the
belief that this Nam appears within concentration.**
_Chhin ik dheyan videh samayi.
Ta ki mahima barnin na jayi._
**The supreme miraculous powers that a
devotee experiences when his Concentration
gets absorbed in the bodiless Nam even for a
moment, can not be described in words.**
_Saar nam Satguru se pavey. Nam dor gahi lok sidhavey.
Saar shabad videh swarupa. Ni-Akshar woh roop anupa.
Tattav prakriti bhav sabb deha. Saar shabad ni:tattav videeha._
**After getting blessed with the Holy Nam from a
Satguru, the jiva ascends the ladder to Amarlok.The
true Nam is bodiless and wordless. The five material
elements and their 25 features are all related to the
body, but the true Holy Nam is far beyond the limit
of these materialistic elements and the body.**


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 53**
_Bavan akshar mein sansara. Ni:Akshar so lok pasara.
Soyi nam hai akshar vasa. kaya te bahar parkasa._
**Whole of the world is absorbed in the net of words
whereas the wordless Nam is to be found in Amarlok
alone. This wordless Nam is indestructible and is
beyond the limit of body.**
_Shabad shabad sabb koyi kahey, woh to shabad videh.
Jibhya per avey nahin, nirakh parakh ke leh.
—Kabir Sahib_
**Everyone is talking about Nam but the real Nam is to
be found beyond the limit of the body. Also, it can’t be
recited by the tongue. So a devotee should assay well
before getting blessed with it.**
_Pind brahmand aur ved kitaib, panch tatt ke para.
Sat lok yahan purush videhi, woh sahib kartara.
—Dadu Dayal Ji_
**Satya lok is far beyond from the limit of the body,
cosmos, Vedas, Kitaib (holy book of the Muslims) and
the five material elements. That Amarlok is the abode
of the bodiless Purush who is the real creator of all.**
_Nam videhi jabb miley, unter khulen kapat.
Deya Sant Satguru bina, ko batlavey baat.
—Tulsi Sahib (Hathrus waley)_
**Tulsi Dassji says, “The inner gates get opened only
after getting blessed with the bodiless Nam. None but
the grace of Sant Satguru can show the needed path in
this regard.”**


```
54 Sahib Bandgi
```
**SPIRITUAL PHILOSOPHY**

The word Sahib is a very sweet & fragrance filled
word coined for Param Purush (Paramatma) by the
holy saints, while Bandgi means to offer salutations.
That is to say Sahib Bandgi is another name for offering
our salutations to Param Purush.
If we make an indepth study of the Sant-Mat, we
shall find no difference between the Sant-Mat & Sahib
Bandgi. And if instead of making a complete study of
Sant-Mat, we should make a brief study of Sahib
Bandgi organization, we shall find in it the charming
waves of the Sant-Mat with all its glare & shine.
The Sahib Bandgi organization has a due place
for the sayings of the Saints. But the sayings of his
holiness Sahib Kabir Sahib has been given the highest
place. Some important aspects of the spiritual
philosophy of this organization are as—
**The form of Ishwar, Jeev, Munn & Maya** : God
is far away from the authority of Sargun & Nirgun.
All the saints have called Him by the name of Sahib.
It is He who has been called as Parampurush as well.
He is far beyond the boundaries of Sakar & Nirakar.
These views of the saints have been opposed at different
times because the great Yogis, Rishis, Munies, Peers,
Palgambars etc., due to their limited approach upto

```
54
```

```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 55
```
Nirgun Bhakti alone, find it hard to believe that there
is some supreme authority even beyond these limits.
The sayings of Guru Nanak Dev ji make it amply
clear—
_....Aath atuaki atari mazara, dekha purush neyara.
Na nirakar, aakar na jyoti, na tahan ved vichara.
Aunkar karta nahin kahiye, nahin tahan kal pasara.
Vah Sahib sabh sant pukara......_
**Nanak Devji says that in the 8th chakkar
(plexus) he was able to have a vision of a
rare Purush who was neither formless nor
with any form & nor in the form of light
even. The Vedas even have not made any
mention of Him. Furthur, He was neither
Onkar nor the creator of the universe.
There was no Niranjan there. All the saints
have called that Supreme Lord as Sahib.**
Kabir Sahib also says—
_Agun kahon to jhuth hai, sagun kaha na jayi.
Agun sagun ke beech mein, Kabira raha lubhayi._
Kabir Sahib says that it is falsehood to call Him
Nirakaar. He can’t be called as Sargun as well. So he
says that He remains absorbed in between Sargun &
Nirgun.
Dadu Dyalji’s views about Kabir Sahib have a great
weightage—
_Koyi sagun mein reejh raha, koyi nirgun thahraye.
Atpat chal Kabir ki, mo se kahi na jaye._


**56 Sahib Bandgi
Dadu Dayalji says that people are
engaged in Sargun (with form) or Nirgun
(formless) kinds of worships & seems to
be satisfied with such worships. But, Kabir
Sahib ji’s philosophy is altogether different
from these & is indescribable.**
In reality, there is not much difference between
Sargun & Nirgun Bhakti’s. Sometimes when the
worshippers of Nirgun Brahm happen to meet me,
they ask me as to what distinguishes Sargun from
Nirgun? I say that in reality Sargun Bhakti involves
five elements, all of which are perishable. There is no
doubt that all these five elements are subject to change.
Our body also is made up of these five elements. So it
is also perishable. Then I ask them to tell me the five
elements that are perishable.
_Geyani se geyani miley, hovey do do baat.
Murakh se murakh miley, khavein do do laat._
**When two intellectuals meet, they talk
about some spiritual thoughts, but when two
fools meet, each has to recieve some kicks
from the hands of the other.**
Now they begin to count the five elements.
**Devotee : jal (water)
Sahibi ji : I understand. Next...
Devotee : Agni (Fire)
Sahibi ji : It is also understandable. Next....
Devotee : Vayu (Air)
Sahibi ji : It is also clear. Fourth...**


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 57
```
**Devotee : Prithvi (earth)
Sahibi ji : Correct. Fifth...
Devotee : Aakash (Sky)
Sahibi ji : What is this?
Devotee : Shunya (Vaccum)
Sahibi ji : What is that Shunya?
Devotee of Nirgun (Holding both the hands away
from each other, they point towards the empty space
in between & say in a low voice....This....**
In this way, when they get startled on finding the
Nirakar included in the five perishable elements, I
make an idea that I should clear to them. I said that
when the fifth element is Aakash (Sky), Nirgun is
naturally included in five elements. So it is also
perishable. Shunya is also perishable.
Those indulged in Nirgun Bhakti should give a
serious thought to it.
Now let me tell you how this Nirgun Nirakar
gets perished—
**Laghu Pralaya :** When there is flood, small
incidents take place, diseases spread & a large number
of people die. It is called as laghu Pralaya.
**Pralaya :** In pralaya, the living beings perishes.
Water waves rise to a height of about 100km & drown
the whole of earth. Life perishes but the sun, the moon,
the stars & the planets escape destruction.
**Mahapralaya :** At the time of Mahapralya, the four
elements—water, fire, air & earth perishes while the
fifth element ‘sky’ escapes.


**58 Sahib Bandgi
Virat Pralaya :** Here all the five elements perish.
That is why the saints have talked of the Supreme
authority that is far beyond Niranjan. There is no
Pralaya at all over there. The saints believe that when
both, the Sargun as well as Nirgun themselves are
perishable, where can the jivas worshipping makes
them go. Clearly, they (soul) will remain entangled in
the 84 lakh yunis. He (soul) will take birth & die again
& again & will never get liberated. How can a thing
be called as Truth when it is bound to perish sooner or
later. In the last moments of life, one realises him
whom one worships. So we won’t be able to realise
truth by the time we remain entangled in perishable
things.
Sargun & Nirgun Bhaktis can, no doubt, keep us
away for some time from the cycle of birth & deaths
but certainly not for all the times to come. These kinds
of Bhaktis can give us 4 kinds of salvations— **Samipaya,
Salokya, Saropya & Sayujaya.**

**1. Samipaya Salvation :** Those who do noble
deeds, don’t harm anybody & also do acts of charity
etc., attain this kind of salvation. After death they find
a place in Pitar Lok (Ancestoral Lok). They enjoy the
comforts of that place for thousands of years & after
the expiry of their period as per their karmas, they
again come to this universe.
**2. Salokya Salvation :** Those who do noble deeds,
refrain from taking meat, wine & worship one or the
other dierty for the whole of their life, attain this kind


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 59
```
of salvation. After death they find a place in Heaven.
But they also have to return to this universe after the
expiry of their period as per their karmas (deeds).

**3. Saropya Salvation :** Those who rise above Sargun
Bhakti & wander in the limits of Brahm, attain this
kind of salvation. They find a place in Brahm Lok.
They remain there for lakhs of years but after the expiry
of their period as per their karmas (deeds), have to
return to this universe.
**4. Sayujaya Salvation :** Those who worship
Nirakar, gets absorbed in Nirakar after death. They
ramain their till Pralaya (Dissolution) & after the re-
creation of the universe, they have to return to this
mortal world.
In vedas, we can find the mention of these four
kinds of salvations. Beyond this, we don’t find any
mention of permanent salvation (where there is no
rebirth) & of Amarlok in any Shastras or other holy
scriptures. All are limited in their approach to Nirakar
alone. In Kabir Sagar one can find—
_Munn hi nirakar niranjan janiye._
**Kabir Sahib says that Munn itself is
formless & Niranjan.**
How did this happen so & why didn’t the saints
talk about Amarlok prior to it? This is because Kabir
Sahib had given a word to Kalpurush not to spread
true worshipness. So it is in Kalyug that the real
salvation & true worshipness made its appearance.
About Kabir Sahib ji, Guru Nanak Devji has said—


**60 Sahib Bandgi**
_Avval sant Kabir hai, dooje Ramanand.
Ta sey bhakti praghat hui, saat deep nav khand._
**Guru Nanak Devji says that the Kabir
Sahib is the greatest saint while Ramanandji
occupies the second place & it is through
these two saints that the mode of worship
spread everywhere in the whole of universe.**
No doubt, the devotee finds pleasure in these four
kinds of salvations but these pleasures are limited &
perishable. This is because the devotee gets only a
Sooksham Deh (ethereal body) which enables him to
go to any place he likes. The body—be it material or
ethereal one is bound to perish. That is why there is
rebirth in these salvations. The saints have described
the Sayujya salvation attained through the worhip of
Nirakar as Kal. This very authority has been called as
Niranjan as well. Now the question arises as to where
is the Supreme Authority where there is no dissolution.
Kabir ji’s sayings clearly reflect that there is Mahashunya
above the Shunya (in the form of Niranjan). There
are seven Lok’s in Maha Shunya separated by huge
distances. First of all there is the Achint Lok, 5
Asankhya yojan above Shunya. After a distance of 3
Asankhya yojan above Achint Lok, there is Sohang
Lok. After 5 Asankhya yojan above it, there is Mool
Surti Lok. After 3 Asankhya yojan above it, there is
Ankur lok. Above it there is Ichha Lok, then Vani
Lok wherefrom one hears Anhad sounds. And above


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 61
```
it there is Sahaj Lok. These seven Lok’s are also called
as seven skies. In comparison to these Lok’s of Maha
Shunya, Niranjan appears to be a small Shunya (zero).
These Lok’s are so huge that crores of our universes
can be accommodated in these. Even upto Sahaj
Purush, that is upto seventh sky, there is Pralaya
(dissolution). The nine Lok’s of Niranjan & Maya are
also upto this place. In this connection Satguru Kabir
ji says—
_Sahaj purush takk jetak bhakha,
yeh rachna parley te rakha.
Aage achhya lok hai bhai,
Aadi Purush yahan aap rahayi._
**All the Lok’s upto Sahaj Lok I have talked
about get perished at the time of great
dissolution. But, there is a Lok beyond these
that never gets perished. This Loka is the
abode of Parampurush.**
Above these Lok’s, _i.e._ one Asankhya yojan above
Sahaj Lok, there is the Lok of Parampurush (Amarlok).
This is the place which never perishes away & where
all the jivas (souls) remain in permanent bliss. Here
all the jivas (souls), absorbed in wonderful & unheard
of pleasures, revolve around Satya Purush (Supreme
Lord). Kabir Sahib says—
_Jahvaan se hansa aaya,
amar hai va lokva.
Tahan nahin pralaya ki chhaya,_


**62 Sahib Bandgi**

```
nahin tahan kachhu moh aur maya.
Geyan dheyan ko tahan na lekha,
pap punya tahanva nahin dekha.
Pavan na pani purush na nari,
hadd-anhad tahan nahin vichari.
Brahm na jeev na tattav ki chhaya,
nahin tahan dass indri nirmaya.
Tahan nahin jyoti niranjan rayi,
akshar achint tahan na nayi.
Kam krodh madd lobh na koyi,
tahanva harash shok na hoyi.
Nad bindd tahan na pani,
nahin tahan sarishti chaurasi jani.
Pind brahmand ko tahan na lekha,
loka lok tahanva nahin dekha.
Aadi purush tahanva asthana,
yeh chariter eko nahin jana.
Kabir Sahib says that the Loka
wherefrom Hansa has come, is beyond
dissolution. There is no element of any sort
of attachment or material things. There is
no state of spiritual knowledge or
meditation there. There are no merits or
sins. Even water & air are not to be found
there. Again there is no male or female.
That Loka is beyond any thing like limit or
limitless. There is no Brahm (God) or jiva
or material element. Also ten kinds of
```

```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 63
```
**organs are also not to be found there. There
is no existence of Jyoti Niranjan. Even
Akshar & Achint can’t reach there. There
is no vice like lust, anger etc. Also, no sorts
ofpleasures or sorrows are to be found there.
Even words are not to be found there. There
is nothing like 84 lakh species. No pinds
(bodies) or Brahmands are to be found
there. No sign of other kinds of Lokas etc.
exists there. That is the abode of Param
Purush. But none knows this secret.**
This description of Amar Lok made by Kabir
Sahib is in a sense scientific one. How can there be
Pralaya where there are no 5 elements to be found?
This is the ultimate reality about which Guru Nanak
Dev ji has said—
_Aadi sach! yugadi sach! hai bhi sach!
Nanak hosin bhi sach !!_
**Guru Nanak Dev Ji says, “That was the
truth from times immemorial, is still the
truth & will remain the truth for all the
times to come.**
Jivas (souls) are the parts of Ishwar that have
separated from Him & are in the prison of this world
of Munn (mind) and Maya (Body). Their real abode
is Amarlok—a very rare & unique one. But the jivas
(souls) have forgotten all about this Loka & are taking


```
64 Sahib Bandgi
```
considering this universe of Kal Purush as the real one.
All this is the play of Kal Purush (Mind) where man is
dancing like a monkey & is thinking his welfare in it.
This Kal Purush is the devil that resides in our bodies
in the form of Munn. This Munn (mind) has
imprisoned all the jivas (souls) in a cage of Maya (body).
Because of this they are unable to know themselves.
Five basic elements constitute Maya & this body is
also Maya because it has been made out of these five
elements. Nature is also Maya. Both Munn & Maya
have united. Maya resides in Munn. This is a hidden
mystery that is known to some rare ones. Munn itself
is Niranjan or Nirakar. Man is able to see His activities
only. The following lines of Kabir Sahib ji make it
quite clear.
_Munn hi sarupi dev niranjan, tohi rakhe bharmayi.
Hey hansa tu Amar Lok ka, parha kal bass aayi.
Panch pachees teen ka pinjrha, ja mein tohi rakha bharmai._
**Sahibji says, “O Hansa! Amar Lok is thy real
abode. But at present you have fallen in the grip
of Kal. In fact, Munn itself is Niranjan (God)
who has imprisoned you in the bodily cage of 5
material elements.
The confusion of jeev & the way to escape :** This
jeevatma has got so much confused by Munn that it
has begun to take itself as body far removed from soul.
The position of the soul has become just like that of an
encaged bird that begins to consider itself a cage instead
of a bird. Infact, a bird also has a soul but this example


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 65
```
has been cited to highlight the sad plight of soul. It is
only Munn & soul that reside in this palace like body.
Mind exercises its control over soul during all the 24
hours & doesn’t give it any opportunity to think & use
its reasoning power. It continues to educate the soul
that it is nothing but body & the soul also begins to
think so & remains absorbed in the task of protecting
the body. It doesn’t make any earnest attempt to reach
upto its original abode. The soul is also called as Dheyan
or Surti (concentration). Munn is ever busy in disturbing
this Surti & doesn’t allow it to concentrate at one point.
If this Surti concentrates for a moment, it gains much
power. The soul has got mixed up with Munn. Munn
has got mixed up in body; body in senses (Indries) &
senses in the world. In this way our attention (Surti,
Soul) has got mixed up with the material world through
Munn. The soul has to escape from this unreal abode to
its real & original abode—the Amarlok. Because the
Sakar & Nirakar Bhakti’s are within the limits of Munn
& Maya. The jeev will have to rise above both of these
bhakti’s to reach Amarlok. He will have to seek the shelter
of a true Satguru & adopt the path of Pra-Bhakti (True
worship). He will have to get blessed with the true Nam.
This is because—
_Koti nam sansar mein, tinte mukti na hoye.
Mool nam jo gupat hai, janey birla koye._
**Sahibji says that there are crores of ‘Nam’
in the world. But they can’t help jiva to attain
liberation. The real Nam is a hidden one
known to some rare true saints only.**


**66 Sahib Bandgi**
Soul is in pains & sufferings under the influence
of mind and body.
He is bound with Maya (body & universe) through
Munn (mind). In fact, this bondage is also nothing
but only the imagination because jeev is chetan (active)
& Maya is jarh (inactive). There is no relation between
Jarh (inactive) & Chetan (active) but jiva (soul) has
been caught treacherously.
When a monkey puts its hand into a narrow pitcher
& collects a handful of grams, it finds it difficult to pull
out his fist & begins to think that someone has caught
hold of it. A parrot also, when it catches hold of a Nalni
(An instrument fitted with a mirror to catch parrots) &
looks into a mirror, thinks that some other parrot has
caught hold of him. Likewise, a jeev has also caught hold
of Maya & thinks that he has been caught by it.
It is not easy to catch a monkey or a parrot. They
are caught in an unreal & confused state of mind. It is
all due to the clever thinking of the hunter that monkey
finds someone catching hold of it & the parrot finds
some other parrot doing the same to it. None can catch
hold of Jeevatma. But it is the Devil Munn (mind)
that has put it into such a confusion. This hunter, in
the guise of Mind (Munn), is far cleverer than the
hunters who catch monkeys & parrots. This is because
the monkeys & parrots think that some one else has
caught hold of them & try to make themselves free,
but they consider themselves as separate from pitchers
& Nalnies. On the other hand, jiva (soul) has begun to
consider Maya (Body) as its ownself & doesn’t try to
understand its real identity. Infact, this is the greatest
& the only wonder of the world. Jeev wants to get rid


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 67
```
of Maya & liberate himself from the ocean of births &
deaths. But the problem is that he has fallen in a great
confusion & has been taking the Maya (body), from
which he wants to liberate himself, as his own. In such
circumstances how can he seek liberation. Jeev is
finding it hard to pull himself out of this confusion
which has been there since ages. Without a Satguru
(Perfect Spiritual Master) it is not possible to get
liberation from it. The power of Nam removes all the
confusion of Jeev from his very interior. He begins to
understand the whole play of Munn Maya. Now he
makes earnest attempts to seek liberation. In such a state
sometimes the power of Nam, acting like a ship, comes
to the rescue of Jiva (soul) & tries to take it out of this
ocean of birth & deaths to Amarlok. But the Jiva catches
hold of Maya & doesn’t want to lose its company. Since
ages together he has taken Maya as truth & has enjoyed
the short lived pleasures out of it. Jeev can come out of
Maya only when it makes itself free from its (of maya)
unreal intoxication. The power of Nam helps in relieving
it from this unreal intoxication. It begins to feel the
world as a dream & a worthless place & its interest in
worldly things begins to decrease. Its attachment for
worldly objects & relations fades & it grows more sad.
Power of Nam again comes to its rescue. At this
moment, Munn begins to show its play because under
no circumstances it allows Jeev to escape from its grip.
It tries to frighten Jeev & creat doubts for him about
the path it has followed. This is the time when jiva has
to show firm faith in its Satguru who is sure to take it
out of this ocean of births & deaths.


**68 Sahib Bandgi**
_Dariya bhavjal agam hai,
Satguru karhu jahaj.
Te hi per hans charhayi ke,
utaro bhavjal par._
**Darya Sahib says that it is not possible to
move out of this worldly ocean. But the
Satguru provides the devotees with the ship
(in the form of Nam) that can help them
reach Amarlok.**
Infact, this Nam is like a ship that helps the disciple
go across the ocean of births & deaths. A true Satguru
is the pilot of this ship & the faith of the disciple acts as
a fuel. All that is needed is to board the ship with the
needed material. It must be remembered that the pilot
will appear only when the disciple has the said fuel
with him. But the wind of Kal tries its best to destroy
this fuel & when this fuel is about to exhaust, the pilot
(Satguru) has to return back & the disciple remains
where he was. If the faith is firm & perfect, the wind of
Kal can’t frighten the disciple & the ship of Nam is
sure to take him to Amarlok. Sahibji has beautifully
remarked in this connection—
_Ja ke munn vishwas hai, sada guru tehi sung.
Koti kal jhikjhor hi, tou na hoye chit bhang._
**Sahibji says that a Satguru remains always
remains with the disciple who has deep faith
& devotion in him. All the attempts of Kal
fail to shake the faith of such a devotee.**

**THE OPPONENTS**

As the Sahib Bandgi Organization has taken the
right path & has given a call for discarding the unreal
rites & rituals (pakhands), it cautions the society against
various sections that are proving a hurdle in the path
of devotion (Bhakti). These sections are neither in any
way related to the Bhakti Marg nor they have anything
to do with path of devotion (Bhakti). They keep the
people entangled in their own net far removed from
the real path of Bhakti. There are five main kinds of
these sections.
One section is that of chelas (Seyanas or Ojhas)
who entangle the people in the bhakti of evil spirits
rather than in the bhakti of God. If a cow doesn’t give
milk or a person happens to be suffering from some
disease, they will say that the cause behind it is that of
Hatya. To earn their means of living they keep the
rich people entangled in their net as long as they can.
In the Gita, Vasudev Krishan has admonished Arjun
that one who worships the pitars, goes to Pitar Lok &
one who worships the devtas, goes to Dev Lok.
Likewise, one who worships the evil spirits, goes to
Prait Yuni (evilspirit). So he asks Arjun to give up the
worship of all these three kinds & concentrate on him
(his guru) alone.

```
69
```

**70 Sahib Bandgi**
The other section is that of astrologers who inspite
of being themselves ignorant of astrology, somehow
or the other manage to cheat people. They devise ever
new means to cheat & rob people. Astrology is the
subject of intellectuals, but, to earn their living, many
Tota Rams can also be seen telling fortunes. These
unreal astrologers are responsible for turning the
attention of the people from the worship of God to
the worship of planets & nakshatras. Can the planets,
Nakshatras & the likedones be superior to Paramatma
(God). He who dies in Kashi gets salvation, while he
who dies in Magghar becomes a donkey, is also the
view point (theory) of these people. Kabir Sahib says
that if He can get salvation from death in Kashi, what
is the obligation of Supreme Lord whom he has
worshipped the whole of his life. To keep the people
out of this confusion & misunderstanding, Kabir Sahib
had decided to seek departure from this world at
Magghar. Thus, those who take to the worship of
planets, Nakshatras etc. knowingly or unknowingly
take them as superior & powerful than the Paramatma
or the God they worship. They don’t seem to have the
firm faith in the power of their Paramatma.
The 3rd section is that of the Tantriks. This section
Sites different kinds of siddhies to create confusion
among the people. Kabir Sahib has cautioned the
people to beware of this section. In this regard Sahibji
has said—
_Tantar mantar sabb jhuth hai, mat bharmo koye.
Satya nam janey bina, kaga hans na hoye._


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 71
Sahibji says that Tantar (Incantation with
special technique), Mantar (Incantation) etc.
are nothing but falsehood. It is not wise to
get misled by these. Without knowing the
real ‘Nam’ a jiva can’t be expected to give up
its crow like habits & turn into Hansa.**
The fourth section tries to cheat the people in the
name of donations while the fifth one creates confusion
among the people in the name of casteism,
untouchability etc.
All these five sections divert the attention of the
people from the true worship of Supreme Lord &
mislead them to a great extent. The Sahib Bandgi
organization cautions every person against these wrong
doers & cheats. The present society is moving away
from the true devotion of Paramatma (God) due to
the wrong acts of these people. They have been
misleading the people since ancient times. This is the
only mode of their living. That is why when they find
that some social reformer is going to bring their wrong
acts to light, they unite together & begin to devise
ways & means to kill him. But when they fail to do so,
they denounce him with all their might & create many
confusions in the minds of people. They do all this to
prevent the people from going to him & to see to it
that their own business keeps on flourishing.
Sometimes the Saints descend on this earth with
precious **Nam** to give eternal peace & permanent bliss
to the people. But what will be the future of those who


```
72 Sahib Bandgi
```
welcome the arrival of Saints by defaming them in
every possible manner. I have no hatered for even those
who are at all times busy denouncing the path of Sahib
Bandgi. I have never been pained at the hands of my
critics. I take them as my preachers.
My critics have done so much job for me as my
disciples couldn’t do even in fifteen years. My disciples
ask for a vehicle, money for oil, mike & the like,
whereas my critics ask for no such material aid & in
every street & crossing continue to talk about Sahib
Bandgi. In connection with the denouncers Paltoo
Sahib has said—
_Nindak jiye jugan jug, kam hamara hoye.
Kam hamara hoye, bin kaurhi ka chakar.
Kamar baandth ker karey, tihun lok ujagar.
Usey hamari fiqar, pal bhar na visare.
Pal bhar na visare, prem mein deta gari.
Paltoo nindak mar geya, tabb hi deen mein roye.
Nindak jiye jugan jug, kam hamara hoye._
**Paltoo Sahib says, “I desires that my
denouncer should live long as it is he who
makes my work easy. He is my selfless
servant. He sets forth with full preparation
to make me popular in the 3 Lok’s. He is
worried at all the times about me & doesn’t
forget me even for a moment. He loves me
much & often uses bad language for me out
of love. That is why I weep when any of
my critics dies.**


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 73**
I have great love for my critics. I consider them as
my own. That is why many of them have now become
my disciples. During his life time Kabir Sahib also had
great love for his critics. In this regard he has said—
_Jidhar dekhta hoon, udhar tu hi tu hai.
Har shei mein tera jalva, dikhta ru bru hai._
**Sahibji says, “O Param Purush! It is your
vision that I see all around & in every thing.**

```
Main sirjaun main maroun, main jarou main khanv.
Jal thal nabh mahun rami raho, mor Niranjan nanv.
I Create; I destroy; I burn and I swallow.I reside
in all the three places—water, land and the
sky—and my name is Niranjan.
```

```
74 Sahib Bandgi
```
**CLARIFICATION OF SOME**

**DOUBTS**

The organization of Sahib Bandgi has a great
respect for all religious scriptures. There is no place for
the criticism of any of these. It stands for welfare of all.
Its aim is not only to think of the welfare of all but
also to fight against the social vices & evils. This is
because rising above these vices alone can help man to
proceed on the path of Bhakti. Just as nectar can’t be
placed in a pot of wine, the lamp of Bhakti can’t be
lightened in an impure heart. For treading on this path
of Bhakti a devotee has to free himself from cheating,
falsehood & other vices.
_Is dil ka hujra saaf ker, jana ke aane ke liye..._
**Sahibji says that a devotee has to sweep
his heart in order to pave the way for the arrival
of Param Purush there.**
That is why to adopt the panth of Sahib Bandgi,
the refraining from vices & evils is the pre-requisite.
Before being blessed with Nam, a devotee has to lake a
pledge that hence forth he—

**1.** won’t tell a lie **2.** won’t take meat **3.** won’t take
wine **4.** won’t commit a theft **5.** won’t gamble **6.**
will have a good character & **7.** Will earn his living in
**74**


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 75
```
a rightful manner. Sahibji describes these as main
features of worship & so one has to abserve these under
all circumstances.
You have to reap the fruit of your Karma. But
after being blessed with Nam, all the previous deeds
get destroyed because then you had not taken the shelter
of a Satguru & were in darkness. But now you will
have to suffer for your bad deeds. The power of Nam
makes it easy for you to keep away from vices. Many
disciples say that whenever, even unknowingly, they
are about to indulge in some bad act, some hidden
power prevents them from doing so. This is nothing
but the power of Nam about which I have time &
again stressed— **The thing that I possess, is not to be
found with anyone else in the entire Brahmand
(Universe).** Because—
_Kag palat hansa ker deena,
aisa nam purush mein deena._
**I have blessed my disciples with such a holy
‘Nam’ of Param Purush which has enabled
them to give up their crow like bad habits &
become pure & flawless like a Hansa.**
Some good & civilised persons because of their
inability to understand this panth in a true manner,
have developed many misunderstandings. Infact, some
doubts have crept into their hearts & it is these that
have prevented them from having faith. If a devotee
lacks faith, he can’t experience the power of Nam.


**76 Sahib Bandgi**
Some think that this organization criticises the
Vedas, Shastras & other religious scriptures. But, the

fact is that I have a great respect for all the religious
books. I myself have made an indepth study of Vedas
& Shastras. Not only this much, I have also studied

the Quran, the Bible, the Ramayana etc.
According to the Vedas there is Nirakar Brahm
but it is not possible to unfold its secrets fully. Furthur

from it there is nothing to be known (Neti Neti). All
religious scriptures give us the knowledge limited to
Nirakar alone. According to the Bible— **I am the only**

**son of my heavenly father.** And heavenly father means
Nirakar. The Quran Sharif also talks of
BechoonaKhudah, that is Nirakar. Kabir Sahib says
that we should take Munn (mind) itself as Nirakar

Niranjan. Following Sant-Mat, the organization of
Sahib Bandgi also accepts the authority of Nirakar. But
it doesn’t stop there. It also gives some hints about what

lies beyond Nirakar.
_Iske aage bhed hamara, janey ga koyi jananhara.
Kahein Kabir janey ga soyi, ja per daya Satguru ki hoyi._
**Sahibji says that his mystery is far beyond
the limits of Niranjan. Only such a devotee
as has the blessings of a Satguru with him,
can know of it.**
There are a large number of saints in the world
today, but none talks of any other authority that lies


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 77**
beyond the Vedas & the Shastras. On the other hand,
the Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib has clearly said—
_Ved hamara bheid hain, hum vedan ke mahin.
Jaun bheid mein main bason, vedbhi janat nahin._
**Sahibji says that the Vedas have in them
the secrets of all of us. But even these can’t
tell about the secret of my abode.**
Like the saints, the panth organization of Sahib
Bandgi also points to the Supreme Lord _i.e._ Parampursh
Sahib that lies far beyond to the reach of vedas. It doesn’t
means that in any way He denounces the Vedas.

```
Sunn gagan mein Sabad uthat hai, so sabb bol mein aavey.
Ni-Sabad woh boley nahin, so Satt Sabad kahavey.
—Paltoo Sahibji
All the words arising in the shunya (Sky-vacuum) forms
the subject of speech, whereas the true word is the
only soundless sound that in no way forms the subject
of speech
```

```
78 Sahib Bandgi
```
**WORSHIP**

Some people believe that Sahib Bandgi
organization prohibits the worship of the Gods and
the Goddesses and thereby denounces them. But, the
fact is that this panth doesn’t denounce any God or
the Goddess. So far as the question of different kinds
of worships is concerned, we should turn to ancient
scripture ‘Rigved’ which talks of—
_‘Eko brahm dutiya nasto.’_
That is, there is one God only. Even the AduetMat
(Soul itself is God) of Shanker Acharya says so. Not
only this, if we study our sacred book Gita, we shall
come to know that Vasudev Krishna advises Arjun to
give up the worship of Pitars, Gods & Evil spirits &
take instead, to Guru Bhakti. Different saints also have
given the message of the oneness of God.
_Devi deval jagat mein, kotin pooje koye.
Satguru ki pooja kiye, sabb ki pooja hoye._
**Sahibji says that the worldly people are
engaged in the worship of crores of gods &
the goddesses. But the worship of a Satguru
alone includes the worship of all of them.**
In the worship of Satguru alone, lies the worship
of all. Infact, Sant Satguru is the mirror through which
we can see God.
**78**


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 79**
_Alakh purush ki aarsi, santan ki hi deh.
Lakha jo chahe alakh ko, inhin mein lakh leh._
**Sahibji says that the body of a saint is the
mirror of Param Purush. He who desires
to have a vision of Param Purush can do so
in the vision of a saint himself.**
Giving the message of oneness of God, Guru
Nanak Dev ji has said—
_Nanak eko sumriye, jal thal raha smaye.
Dooja kahe sumriye, jo janmey aur mer jaye._
**Nanak Dev ji says that we should
worship only the Supreme Lord who is
omnipresent. It is useless to worship other
dieties who take birth & die.**
The Organization of Sahib Bandgi also gives the
message of the worship of one God. God can be realised
through love alone & this love should be pure & holy.
Love remains holy as long as it flows in the same
direction. But, when it divides into two parts & begins
to flow in two different directions, it becomes impure.
This is because the element of faith gets removed from
it. Faith is such an important part of love that its
absence destroys the very basis of love. And whenever
this faith divides in two or more than two parts, it gets
shattered & as a result of it love itself can’t escape from
being shattered. Now the question arises as to why
does the faith waves or divide into two parts? The simple
answer to the question is that if a guru tells his disciple


**80 Sahib Bandgi**
something about Amarlok & blesses him with the holy

Nam that has the power to give complete liberation

& the disciple on the basis of faith experiences & hears

inside all that he does outside, it take for granted that

the knowledge given was that of the body & not of

the soul. In Kabir Sagar we find—

```
Kaya nam sabbhin gun gavey,
videh nam koyi virla pavey.
Videh nam pavey ga soi,
jis ka satguru sancha hoyi.
```
```
Sahib Sahib ji says that all are reciting
the Nam that remains up to the limit of
body alone & is recited by the tongue. But
it is only some rare devotee who gets blessed
with the Nam that reaches his very soul.
And a devotee of a true satguru alone can
do so.
Kabir Sahib has again said—
Jabb takk guru miley nahin sancha,
tabh takk karo guru das pancha.
Kabir Sahib says that a devotee can seek
the shelter of different Gurus as long as he
is able to seek some true Satguru.
Keeping this in view, we should worship & love
```
Param Purush only.


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 81**
Just as a wife never likes that her husband should
have love affairs with some other woman & a husband
also doesn’t like that his wife should have love affairs
with some other man, Parampurash also doesn’t like
to see that His devotee should worship some other
diety who is also His own creation. God has a great
love for His devotees & in return expects nothing but
love. Jeevatmas having been separated from
Parampurash have got entangled in this Mayajal. These
(souls) all are a part of Parampurush. How can the
Parampurash see the souls, that are a part of Him, love
someone else.
A devotee can’t be considered as a true devotee
unless he has full faith in his Guru or God. So when a
devotee begins to worship some other diety to relieve
himself from some problem, he knowingly or
unknowingly insults his Guru or God because such
an action clearly shows his lack of faith in his Guru or
God.
It also shows that he considers some other diety as
more powerfull than his own Guru. To site an
example, if some devotee, in order to relieve himself
of the problems given by evil spirits, goes to some
person who practises Tantar Mantar (Ojha), it clearly
shows that he thinks his Guru or God can’t relieve
him of his problems. He thus underestimates the power
of his Guru or God.
For achieving salvation as well, if some disciple
shows faith in some other Guru, it means he believes
that his own Guru can’t take him out of the ocean of
births & deaths. Doing so, he attaches less importance


```
82 Sahib Bandgi
```
to his Guru. His Guru should be all powerful. What
kind of a Guru is he, who can’t make his disciple
achieve salvation & forces him to show faith in some
other Guru or God.
The Organization of Sahib Bandgi lays stress on
the worship of who has all the power to take the Souls
out of the circle of birth and death (out of three
Dimensional Universe) and has true faith on Sahib ji.

```
Hadd tappe so Auliyan, be hadd tappe so Peer.
Hadd-be-hadd donon tappe, tiska nam Kabir.
He who crosses the limit is called as a Sage; he
who crosses the limitless is called as a Peer while
he who crosses both—the limit as well as the
limitless—is known by the name of Kabir.
```

```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 83
```
**GURU & GOBIND**

Some people think that in Sahib Bandgi panth it
is the Guru who has been considered as everything &
that doesn’t look fair at all. I would like to draw the
attention of such people to our ancient scripture, the
Rigved that says—
_Guru brahma guru vishno,
guru devaan maheshwara.
Guru sakshat perbrahm,
tasmey shri guruve nama._
**According to Rigveda, it is Guru alone
who is Brahma, Vishnu & Shankar as well.
He is the visible Param Brahm (God). So
salutations are offered at the holy feet of a
Guru.**
In Ramcharit Manis we find—
_Guru bin bhav nidhi tarhin na koyi,
hari biranch shankar samm hoyi._
**Tulsi Dass ji says that none can cross the
worldly ocean without the guidance of a
Guru even if he be equivalent to Brahma,
Vishnu or Shiva.**
The whole philosophy of saints revolves around
Guru. Sahjo Bhai has worked wonders in this field.
**83**


```
84 Sahib Bandgi
```
She considers the status of a Guru as higher than that
of God. Her following sayings clarify the reason for
her saying so—
_Hari ko tajun, guru ko na visarun.
Guru ke samm, hari ko na niharun.
Hari ne janam diyo jagg mahin.
Guru ne aava gaman chhurhahi.
Hari ne panch chor diye satha.
Guru ne chhurhaye liye snatha.
Hari ne kutumbh jal mein gheri.
Guru ne kati mamta meri.
Guru na tajun, hari ko tajj darun.
Guru ke samm, hari ko na niharun._
**Sahjo Bai says, “I can leave God but I
can’t leave my Guru. I don’t want to see
God even in the presence of my Guru. God
threw me in the worldly ocean but it is my
Guru who saved me from it. God had sent
along with me five thieves like lust, anger
etc. but my guru freed me from their grip
as well. Further, God had entangled me in
the net of family but the Guru freed me
from this net of attachment as well. As such
I can’t leave the company of my guru even
if I have to forget all about God.”**
Infact, a Satguru has been accorded a high status
simply because it is through his medium alone that we
can realise Parampurush.


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 85**
Some people with the modern views think that
God realization is possible even without the aid of a
Guru. They think that without the aid of a Guru even,
they will recite the holy Nam and can achieve
salvation. Kabir Sahib says that if simple recitation of
Ram Ram can help in realizing Ram, then certainly it
should be possible to sweeten our mouth by uttering
the word **Sugar** & to satisfy our hunger by uttering
the word **food.** Likewise, a person who desires to
become wealthy, has to labour hard to earn money.
Simple uttering of the word, wealth wealth, can in no
way help him in becoming wealthy. In the same
manner the ignorant ones recite the holy name of
Ram, but in order to realise that Ram they don’t seek
the shelter of a Guru. Just as a parrot on being taught
begins to recite Ram Ram, but due to lack of
knowledge doesn’t understand the importance of Ram
and on finding the opportunity flies back to the forest
where he forgets the holy name of Ram, a foolish man
also, inspite of reciting Ram Ram, is not going to
reap any benefit. No doubt, uttering the word sugar-
sugar can’t sweeten our mouth but if someone puts
sugar in our mouth, we shall definitely feel the sweet
taste. All that we need to do is to keep our tongue and
teeth in motion. Likewise, Paramatma can’t be realised
by simple recitation of words but when some true
Satguru makes the Holy Nam appear in the interior
of a disciple, the latter has not to make any extra
attempt in this regard. All that he has to do is to keep


```
86 Sahib Bandgi
```
on reciting that holy Nam. This simple technique
enables him to realise Paramatma and achieve salvation.
Infact, this Nam itself is the Godly power that lies
asleep in every human being. A Satguru awakens that
sleeping Godly power which remains with the disciple
for the whole of his life. It protects him at the time of
need & takes him to his original abode. That is why
after seeking the holy Nam almost all disciples
experience some invisible power with them at all the
times. This power helps them in their times of
difficulties. It will be right to mention some wonderful
incidents experienced by the disciples. The readers can
find some such happenings in the next capter.

```
Distinction between
Guru & Satguru
```
The readers will find the frequent use of the words
Guru & Satguru in the books published by the Sahib
Bandgi organization.
In the ordinary sense we call even a teacher as a Guru
though his teachings are limited to the material world
alone and have nothing to do with the spiritual world.
It is in the spiritual line alone that we make use of
the words Guru and Satguru.
A Guru is considered as a religious teacher who
possesses the spiritual knowledge & is in a position to
impart the same to his disciples for their spiritual
upliftment.


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 87
```
We find the mention of the word ‘Guru’ in our holy
scriptures like the Ramayana, the Gita & the like. But,
it is important to know that the knowledge of a Guru
is limited to that of 3 lok’s alone. As such a guru can
in no way be expected to help us to attain true
salvation.
It is, rather, a Satguru alone who can help us in this
regard. Now the question arises as to how can we
distinguish a Guru from a Satguru? For this we have
to remember that there has been no mention of the
word ‘Satguru’ anywhere & in any holy scripture
before the incarnation of Kabir Sahib. A Satguru alone
possesses the complete knowledge of the 4th loka. It
was only Kabir Sahib who used this word for a Guru who
possesses the following seven virtues :
**1**. He should keep away from lustful life.

**2.** He should have no attachment.
**3.** He should depend on his own earnings.
**4.** He should not be greedy.
**5.** He should be truthful & unselfish.
**6.** He should have knowledge of all the holy scriptures.
**7.** He should have attained union with Param Purush.
So wherever the readers may find the mention of
the word ‘Guru’ in relation to Param Purush, they
should have no doubt
in their mind that the guru mentioned is Satguru alone.
Such a Satguru alone has the power to bless the jivas

**Guru**

**1. Guru’s Nam is of five elements, centrates in a body.
2. Guru’s reach is only upto the 10th aperture.**
   _Kahain Kabir akshar ke aage, ni akshar nahin pahichana._
   **The five words and the five postures are nothing but**

**the network of the lord of death. Kabir Sahib says**

**that none can recognize the ‘wordless’ that lies beyond**

**the limit of words.**
_Kaya nam sabhin gun gavai, videh nam koyi virla pavai.
Videh nam pavey ga soyi, jiska Satguru sancha hoyi._
**All are singing in praise of Nam that has some definite**

**form but it is only some rare one who gets blessed up**

**with the formless Nam. And only a devotee who has**

**sought the shelter of some Perfect spiritual Master**

**can get blessed with this holy Nam.**
_Jab tak guru miley nahin sancha.
Tab tak karo guru dus pancha._
**One can seek the shelter of even five or ten gurus by
the time one is able to find some perfect Satguru.**

**Satguru**

**1. Satguru Nam is beyond five elements, centrates**

**out side body.**

**2. Satguru directly has a reach upto the 11th aperture**

**which is Amarlok.**
_Chhin ik dheyan videh samayi.
Ta ki mahima barnin na jayi._


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 89
The supreme miraculous powers that a
devotee experiences when his Concentration
gets absorbed in the bodiless Nam even for a
moment, can not be described in words.**
_Shabad shabad sabb koyi kahey, woh to shabad videh.
Jibhya per avey nahin, nirakh parakh ke leh.
—Kabir Sahib_
**Everyone is talking about Nam but the real Nam is to
be found beyond the limit of the body. Also, it can’t be
recited by the tongue. So a devotee should assay well
before getting blessed with it.**
_Pind brahmand aur ved kitaib, panch tatt ke para.
Sat lok yahan purush videhi, woh sahib kartara.
—Dadu Dayal Ji_
**Satya lok is far beyond from the limit of the body,
cosmos, Vedas, Kitaib (holy book of the Muslims) and
the five material elements. That Amarlok is the abode
of the bodiless Purush who is the real creator of all.**
_Nam videhi jabb miley, unter khulen kapat.
Deya Sant Satguru bina, ko batlavey baat.
—Tulsi Sahib (Hathrus waley)_
**Tulsi Dassji says, “The inner gates get opened only
after getting blessed with the bodiless Nam. None but
the grace of Sant Satguru can show the needed path in
this regard.”**
_Dasvein dwar te neyara dwara. Taka bheid kahun mein sara.
—Kabir Sahib
Nau dwarey sansar sab, dasvein yogi sadhu.
Ekadash khidki bani, janat Sant sujan.

**WHAT DO THE DISCIPLES SAY**

**1.** A disciple came to me after being blessed with
Nam & said—
**Disciple :** Sahibji, I am fully convinced today.
**Sahib ji :** Why not earlier? Let me know how
did it happen now?
**Disciple :** Sahibji, I was standing in my room.A
sound from within asked me to come
out.....the roof is about to fall. I thought
as to how can the roof fall. I kept standing
in the room. Then, all of a sudden, some
invisible power pulled me out in a
moment & the roof fell down. Now I
am fully convinced.
**2.** Hira Singh from Sai Klaan camp phagla, Jammu
says that after serving for 28 years in army he got
blessed with a Nam from some guru belonging to some
other panth. He served in that panth for 18 years. He
also served as secretary Satsang Ghar & even as
Jathedar. In 1977, he came to Akhnoor Ashram &
listened to the satsang. An idea that came to mind was
**‘Sewa Ek Guru Anek’** & he decided to be blessed with
holy Nam. Next month, he came to Ranjri Ashram
for the said purpose.
He clearly says that he has wasted all those 18 years.
He has clarified his remarks in a beautiful statement-
90


**Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 91
I obtained within a year of my association with
Sahib ji that which I couldn’t obtain in my 18 years
of association with the other panth. It is not in my
power to explain the sights I have seen under the
shelter of Sahib ji.’** To give a final turn to his statement,
he says that he has been in the service of Sahibji since
August 1977. He is very happy. All the members of
his family have sought the shelter of Sahibji. Also, about
5000 more people have been blessed with Nam. Those
belonging to the other Panth haven’t taken these
activities pleasantly & call him as the agent of Sahibji.
They say that it is he alone who is taking the devotees
of their Panth to Sahibji. But the truth is that it is not
he who has been doing all this. It is Sahibji who is
doing the same.

**3.** Ashok Kumar, a resident of Toaf Morh, Jammu
speaks about his problems before being blessed with
Nam **“I couldn’t sleep. Often I felt as if some invisible
thing was trying to over power me. There were
quarrels among family members. The son was
suffering from fits. Doctors failed to provide cure to
my son as well as to myself.”**
After being blessed with Nam, he says, **“There is
peace & calm at home. The son has also recovered
fully. Even at the lonely places I don’t feel afraid of
anything. It appears as if some power always remains
with me.”
4.** One Krishan Lal from Chhanni Himmat says
that once his younger son, while playing near a


```
92 Sahib Bandgi
```
wedding hall, tried to pass through two narrow pillars.
In the attempt his head got caught in between them.
People gathered there. All the attempts to free his head
from there failed. Some suggested that the pillars should
be broken, but that didn’t appear proper. Now he
turned his attention to Sahibji. A little force made it
possible to free the child from there. In many such
like cases, Sahibji has come to the rescue.

**5.** One Satpal from Talore, Samba says that they
were suffering from the problem of Hatya. After
seeking the shelter of Sahibji, everything seems to have
become normal. It appears as if some invisible force
appears from nowhere to protect them at the time of need.
**6.** One Balkrishan from Old Mahavir Nagar, New
Delhi, a youngster of present age says **“All my inner
vices perished altogether right on the day I got blessed
with the holy Nam. I have succeeded in gaining control
over my senses. All my desires to see the movies or to
wear beautiful clothes & the like have vanished. It
doesn’t take me long to come out of any problem
that appears. I have developed sympathy for the poor&
the needy. I take pity even on animals whom I find in
trouble & try to remove their problem to the extent I
can. I enjoy the grace of Satguru ji & even though I
find it difficult to sit in meditation, I enjoy the spiritual
joys. All this is possible due to the deep faith that I
have in Sahibji.”
7.** Smt. Poonam Devi from Peerkho, Jammu says
**“I was suffering from Kidney pain for the last 10-11**


```
Sadguru Bhakti (Supreme Power) 93
```
**years. All kind of medical treatment proved to be of
no avail. After seeking the shelter of Sahibji, I don’t
feel any need to go to any doctor. I feel as if I have
got everything one can desire. At all times I feel as if
some one is helping me. Reciting the holy Nam, I
don’t remember when any problem appeared &
perished. About 10 months back I sought the shelter
of Sahibji & have achieved much more than one can
think of.”**

**8.** One Smt. Janko Devi from village Akhal says
**“Earlier we were suffering from the problem of Hatya.
Elder son, because of brain injury, was sad. After being
blessed with Nam, everything seems to have
undergone a complete change. Earlier we had no
definite jobs to do.”**
Recalling an incidence concerning her husband
she says **“Once my husband was going some where.
On the way he happened to touch an electric wire
that was lying on the ground. He fell down
unconscious. In the meantime, I also came out in
connection with some work and finding him in such
a condition ran out towards him. He was lying
unconscious but, all of a sudden, he uttered the
words—Do Something. I collected some people &
they ranged to the electric station. The electric current
was cut off. He regained consciousness. He remained
in contact with the electric wire for about 10-15
minutes but still nothing happened to him. What
more can I say about the power of Sahibji.”**


**94 Sahib Bandgi**
As mentioned earlier, some selfish sects ask people
not to associate themselves with this panth because I,
with my spiritual power, attract every ongoer to myself
& the person concerned finds it hard to go to some
other panth.
But, in reality, it is the power of Nam that saves
man from going astray. One recieves all comforts
through the power of true Nam.
The wonder & strange thing about the Sahib
Bandgi Panth is that every Naami feels the presence
of some invisible power with him/her for all the 24
hours. This mysterious power guides him/her in the
time of difficulty—be it relating to the outer world or
the inner world. That is why every Nami feels so much
satisfaction here that he seldom thinks of wandering
from pillar to the post.
You are also welcome to this Panth (organization).
Don’t care for the world if you want to make a search
for the truth. The world doesn’t spare anyone. Neither
it allows anybody to laugh nor does it allow anyone
to weep. If one laughs, it takes him as mad & if one
weeps, it takes him as a fool. If you have nurtured
some wrong notions, it hardly matters. This is because
these notions are not your own creations. It is rather
the world that has given you all this. Return it back to
the world. Don’t delay to correct the wrong that has
been done by you knowingly or unknowingly.

**DIFFERENT FROM**

**THE WORLD**
Sahib Bandgi organization has brought a
scientific revolution in the spiritual world. First of all
we are going to tell five different things to the world.
F This is the world of kal Niranjan. Niranjan rules here.
F Yogis have to struggle hard to reach upto their
abode. That is the 14th loka. Vedas have called
him by different names like, Niranjan,
Nirakar, Nirankar, Par Brahm.
F Gunn, Gandharv, Sidh, Rishi, Muni, Peer,
Peigambar etc. have gone upto this place only.
_i.e._ 14th Lok
F Beyond Shunya there is Maha-shunya. There
is nothing to be found here. Achint Lok,
Sohang Lok, Mool Surti Lok, Ankur
Lok, Ichhya Lok, Vani Lok & Sahaj Lok,
are all in this Maha Shunya. All the lokas
upto Sahaj Lok are perishable.
_Sehaj purush takk jetak bhakha,
yeh rachna parley te rakha.
Aage achhya lok hai bhai,
Aadi Purush yahan aap rahayi._
**All that is described in relation to Sahaj
Purush falls within the limit of dissolution.
Further from it there is the immortal loka
where the Supreme Lord Himself resides.
95**


**96 Sahib Bandgi**
_Jahvan se hansa aaya,
Amar Hai Vo Lokva.
Tahan nehin parley ki chhaya,
nahin tahan kachhu moh aur maya.
Geyan dheyan ko tahan na lekha,
pap punya tahanva nahin dekha.
Pawan na pani purush na nari,
hadd anhadd tahan nahin vichari._
F **The place from where Hansa (Soul) has
descended, is beyond any kind of dissolution.
There is neither water, nor air, nor earth, nor
sky. There are no sun or moon and no play of
day and night. Also, there is no Jyoti Niranjan,
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Parvati and Ganesh.
There are no yogis and munies! No beginnings
and endings and no sufferings and tortures
from Kal even.
Sahibji says that he has come with a message
from that loka and our real welfare lies in getting
blessed with the true Nam that alone has the power
to take us there.**
It is from here that Sahib ji descends down for
showing the path of salvation to Jivatmas (Souls).

_Antt kal jab jeev ka aavey,

Nabhi dwar se jeev jabb jayi,

**After death, a Jeev will born again in a yuni
(Specie) depending on his Karmas (Deeds). Sahib ji
has talked about how one can know about the yuni, a**


```
98 Sahib Bandgi
```
**person attains after death. He says that if after death
the pranas escape from Anus (Mal Dwar), the person
goes to hell. This is because that is the gateway to hell.
The waste products of such a person come out at the
time of death. If the pranas escape from the opening
of urine gland (Mutar Dwar), the person will born in
Jalchar yuni (aquatic animals). The urine of such a
person comes out at the time of death.
If the pranas escape from mouth, the person
will born in Ann Khani (crop feeders). Such a person
will born as an insect. The mouth of such a person
remains wide open at the time of death. If the pranas
escape through nostrils, the person will born in
AndajKhani (flying). He will born as a bird etc. If the
pranas escape from eyes, the person will born as a fly
etc. At the time of death his eyes will remain open. If
the pranas escape through ears, the person will at once
born in prait yuni (Ghost etc.). The very sight of the
body of such a person will appear to be fearful. If the
pranas escape from the 10th dwara (aperture), the
person will go to heaven and come to the world again
as a king. The person looks in a happy mood at the
time of death. If the pranas escape through the 11th
dwara, the person becomes liberated from the cycle of
births & deaths & goes to Amarlok, the abode of Param
Purush (the permanent Salvation).**

   Khechri that are
   present in our body.
3. Here Nam falls within
   the limit o f 5 elements
