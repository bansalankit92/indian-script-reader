The Search
```
Jehi Khojat Kalpo Bhaye, Ghathi Mahin So Moor.
Badi Garab Guman Te, Ta Te Pari Gayo Dhoor.
```
He whose search we make in external world, resides within us.
We can attain God by the grace of Satguru alone. The path the worldly people have chosen for attaining salvation; is related to Munn-Mind. Some are making a search of Lord in the forests; some through austerities; some through the practice of yoga while others are doing so by pilgrimages.
Sahib Kabir cautions us—

```
Kasturi Kundal Basey, Mrig Khoje Bann Mahin.
Aise Ghat Ghat Saiyan, Moorakh Janat Nahin.
```

The musk deer has musk in its navel region but, out of
ignorance, it makes a search for it in the forest. Likewise,
Sahib is present within every man, though the ignorant persons
don’t know it. The deer makes a search of musk by smelling
every herb. It thinks that the fragrance is coming from some
outside place. It spends its whole life in this vain attempt
but fails to know that the fragrance is coming from within
its ownself. Likewise, man tries to make a search for Supreme
Purush in the outside world. Sahib Kabir says—
Lakhon Ner Talash Mein. Ghar Mila Na Avinashi Ka.
Lakhs of people are making a search but none has
succeeded in knowing His abode. Though many persons are
making a search of him in the outer world, yet there are many
others who make a search of Him within them. Among those
who are making a search within them, some wander in Bunk
Naal; some in Bhanwar Gufa while others try to search Him
through the practice of different yogic postures like Unmuni,
Khechri, Bhoochri etc.
Some raise their eyes towards Shunya (Inner Sky) and


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 5

pray to their God saying, “O God! listen to my prayer”.
Sahib Kabir has beautifully said—

Mo Ko Kahan Dhoondhe Re Bandey, Main To Tere Pass Mein.
O Man! where are you making a search of me? I am
very much near you.

```
Na Main Jall Mein, Na Main Thall Mein.
Nahin Shunya Akash Mein.
Neither I reside in water or earth nor in Shunya (sky).
```
Na Teerath Mein Na Moorat Mein. Na Ekant Nivas Mein.
I am not to be found at any religious place or idol. Also,
I cannot be found in any lonely place.
Na Mandir Na Masjid Mein. Na Kashi Kailash Mein.
I am not to be found in temple, mosque, Kashi and
Kailash even. Some go to the mountains to make a search
of Him but He is not to be found there as well.

```
Na Main Jap Mein, Na Main Tap Mein.
Na Main Vrat Upvas Mein.
None can find me through recitation of Mantras (sacred
```
words), penence or through observing of fasts.Many poor
people receive that which is much less than the normal one
for man. In that case they should find it easy to attain Him.
But it is certainly not so.

Na Main Kriya Karam Mein Rahta. Nahin Yog Sanyas Mein.
None can attain me through the performance of Karmas
(deeds), practice of yog or through renunciation of world.
It is not bad to have a bath early in the morning but it is

wrong to think that we can attainment him through Holy bath.
Meen Sada Jall Mein Rahey.
The fish remains at all the times in water. Then it should

attain Him easily. It is not my motive to criticise anyone. I
only mean to say that Lord is present within you. All that


6 Sahib Bandgi

you need is to seek the shelter of real Satguru who can help
you attain Him.
Kahain Kabir Bheidi Liya, Pall Mein Dait Lakhat.
Sahib Kabir says that an expert in this field can help a
devotee attain Him within a moment. If torturing the body
through austerities could help one attain Lord, those suffering
from painful diseases would have attained Him easily.
Nahin Pran Mein Nahin Pind Mein. Na Brahmand Akash Mein.
I am not to be found in the pranas (vital force), body or
in the sky.
Na Main Brehkuti Bhanwar Gufa Mein.
Nahin Nabhi Ke Pass Mein.
Fixing concentration at trehkuti or listening to the musical
notes in Bhanwar gufa can’t help one attain Me. I am not to
be found near the navel region as well.
Then where is His abode?
Khoji Hoye Turat Mil Jaun, Ik Pall Ki Talash Mein.
Kah-Hin Kabir Suno Bhayi Sadho, Sub Swanson Ki Swans Mein.
Sahib Kabir says that he who makes a search of Him
like a true devotee, can attain Him within a moment. He is
present within every breath. That is to say, the Soul resides
within the breath (Surti and Nirati) and Param Purush resides
within the Soul.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 7

#### 1. Mind will make you dance in chain, Otherwise.

#### chains, Otherwise

Jo Rakshak Tahan Cheehnat Nahin.
Jo Bhakshak Tahan Dhyan Lagahin.
Instead of trying to know as to who is their real saviour,
the people meditate on him who is their torturer.
The Mind resides at such a safe place within the body
that none will have a sight of it. Any efforts in this regard
are bound to fail. Even the great intellectuals have failed to
know the way it makes everyone dance to its tune.
Jeev Ke Sung Munn Kaal Rahayi. Agyani Nar Janat Nahin.
The ignorant jeev doesn’t know that Kaal in the guise
of Mind is at all the times with him.
It makes us sleep or eat as and when it desires so.
Munn Hanse Munn Rovey, Munn Jagey Munn Sovey.
Munn Leve Munn Deve, Munn Ka Sub Vyavhar.
Kahat Kabir Suno Bhayi Sadho, Jagat Bana Hai Munn Se.
It is the Mind that laughs and weeps or keeps awake
and sleeps or gives and takes. Sahib Kabir says that whole
of the universe is a creation of Mind alone.
Munn Hi Kayar Munn Hi Data.
It is the Mind that becomes a coward or the doer of
charitable acts.
The Mind has its sway in the entire 3 lokas-Earth, Heaven
and Hell.
Tahi Na Cheehnat Pandit Qazi.
The Hindu and the Muslim priests fail to understand the
role of Munn.
It is not influenced by any kind of worship. To bring
it under control is a futile task. Ravan was a very learned
person. He had good knowledge of all the four Vedas. But
still he abducted the wife of Ram. Sahib Kabir has beautifully
said—

```

```

8 Sahib Bandgi

Kya Huwa Vedon Ke Padne Se Na Paya Bheid Ko.
Atma Janey Bina Koyi Gyani Kehlata Nahin.
Study of the Vedas is useless if one fails to find the secret
related to Param Purush. Without having a knowledge of the
Soul, none can be called as a learned man.
After all, what does the Mind desire? It wants that the
Soul should, under no circumstances, have a knowledge of
it. As such, it tries its utmost to keep it away from its ownself.
Tera Bairi Koyi Nahin, Tera Bairi Munn.
It is none but your Mind is your enemy.
After holding a Satsang at Gonda, I was taking rest. A
man was sitting outside for a long time. When I came out,
he said that he had been waiting for an hour. I asked him
the reason of his coming.
He said that he wanted to know how much it would cost
to load 6½ quintals of sugarcane @ Rs 7 per quintal. He had
been waiting outside simply for knowing this much. It means,
he had no faith in any other fellow. He had 3 brothers and
there were 8 members in his family including the children and
the grand children. None of them could help the fellow know
of the actual amount. I asked him if the people were against
the opening of any school there. He replied in positive. I asked
him the reason thereof. He said that they wanted to utilise the
services of others in their lands. There was a school at some
distance from there. A child used to go there. One day, while
crossing the road, he met with an accident and died. After
that incident the people didn’t send their children. I told the
people that if they sold the needed land to me, I would get a
school constructed there and would make arrangement for free
education of their children. Four people said that they had
small pieces of land and were willing to offer it for the
construction of the school. When I again visited there after a
period of about one month, I came to know that the people
there had spread a rumour that Maharaj had forcibly snatched
the land. My Namis requested me to return the land. Just see
the technique of the people with vested interest. They wanted


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 9

to let the children remain uneducated so that they may be able
to exploit them in a manner they liked.
Likewise, the Mind wants to keep the Soul ignorant. It
desires that it should never be able to know its real identity.
That is why its agents (the hypocrites) try their best to keep
the people entangled in the outward world. Those who tried
to spread the message of truth were tortured. Many of them
were murdered. Some were poisoned while others were burnt
alive.The inner enemies create hurdles whenever the Soul
tries to know itself.
Chashm Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashe Ho Rahey.
Dil Satan Kya Kya Hain Terey, Dil Satane Ke Liye.
The jiva feels pained only after attaining the physical
body. It stands in no need of wealth, relations or any other
material thing. It is a store-house of pleasures and needs no
material thing. The tongue needs eatables and the eyes need
beautiful sights for their satisfaction. But it is the Soul alone
that is totally unrelated to such things. In such circumstances,
which is the power that feels pleasure in torturing it in
one way or the other.
Deh Dharey Ka Dand Hai, Bhugtat Hain Sub Koye.
Geyani Bhugtat Geyan Se, Moorakh Bhugtat Roye.
Attaining of the physical body is a sort of punishment.
While the learned persons face it with the power of their
knowledge, the fools do so weeping.
But the question arises as to who has put the Soul in
this bodily cage. It is the Munn that has done so. No kind of
incantation or the japp can help it escape from its prison house.
Visiting holy places or doing such act, rites or rituals are
sure to prove fruitless.
Naam Hoye To Maath Navave,
Na To Yeh Munn Baandh Nachave.
This Mind bows only before one who has got blessed
with Naam. Others have to dance to its tunes.


10 Sahib Bandgi

#### 2. Man is unwilling to understand....

Kaal Ka Jeev Maney Nahin,
Main Kotin Kahoon Samujhaye.
Main Kheenchat Hoon Satlok Ko,
Yeh Bandha Yampur Jaye.
Inspite of my tireless attempts, the jivas in the universe
of Kaal doesn’t try to understand the reality. I try to take

them to Satlok but they prefer to go to Yampuri in chains.
Who is the Jiva of Kaal Purush? It is one who acts as

per the dictates of Kaal (Mind). All the Individuals are acting

as per the dictates of Kaal. After getting separated from Param

Purush, all fell in the grip of Kaal and began to worship him.

Their power of perception began to show a decrease and they

began to turn towards the irrational modes of worship. They

began to worship the evil spirits as well. However, enlightened

Souls don’t turn to such irrational modes of worship.
Karam Sani Buddhi Utpani.
One’s Karmas (deeds) have a direct bearing on one’s

intellect. Only after becoming fully awakened, the Soul begins

to understand as to what is right or wrong for it. Otherwise,

the intellect of the worldly jivas has a coating of Mind-Maya

over it. Sahib Kabir says—

```
Main Aaya Sansar Mein, Phira Ganv Ki Khor.
Aisa Banda Na Mila, Jo Leejai Phatak Pichhour.
After entering this universe, I went to the village streets
```
but failed to find even a single jiva who was awakened enough

to follow the true mode of worship -Sathya Bhakti.
The worldly people lack intellect to understand the

true mode of worship. None is found worthy of attaining
10


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 11

the real spiritual knowledge. Goswami ji says—

```
Bhakti Swatantra Sakal Gunkhani.
Binu Satsang Na Pavat Prani.
The true Devotion (Sathya Bhakti) is a treaure-house of
```
virtues like forgiveness, pity and truthfulness. A jiva can attain

it only through the medium of Satsang.

```
This true mode of worship is not an ordianary thing.
```
Then why has man entangled himself in worship, which is
of no use to the Soul? The only reason behind all this is that

Kal Purush has misled man extensively.

Sahaj Shunya Mein Keen Thikana.
Kal Niranjan Sub Ne Mana.
Brahma Vishno Aur Shiv Deva.
Sub Mil Laag Niranjan Sewa.
Kaal Niranjan has his abode in shunya (Dark matter-
Sky). All take him as God. Brahma, Vishno and Shiv are

all engaged in his worship.


12 Sahib Bandgi

#### 3. O Niranjan! strange is thy Durbar

#### Durbar

What sort of a world it is! I feel very much irritated. I take
whole of the world as mad.
Santo Yeh Jug Baurana.
Sanch Kaho To Maran Dhavai, Jhuthe Jug Patiyana.
Sahib Kabir says that the world behaves as a mad. It
showers honour on the liars but attacks those who dare to
speak the truth.
What sort of thoughts have we developed? On the eve
of Janamashtmi, I saw a fellow performing the role of
Vasudev. He was carrying a basket on his head. The child in
the basket was shown as Krishan. When that child walked,
the women folk thronged to have a glimpse of him. Just see
the mentality of the people. Even after knowing that the fellow
is not the real Krishna but only a normal child acting as
Krishna, the people begin to show devotion and respect to
him. To what an extent have we been misled?
If some boy assumes the role of Hanuman, the worldly
people begin to bow their head before him in such a manner
as if he were the real Hanuman. We are trying to remove
the misconceptions of the people. I want to tell you about
many irrational and unscientific beliefs. For our liberation
we seem to be prepared to do what others say. So to say, the
people are blindly following others. Many women who were
running to touch the feet of the boy (acting as Krishan) fell
down. In their opinion, the mere touching of feet was sure
to make their lot divine. How much thoughtless the ladies
are!
In the Ramayan Serial, a girl had performed the role of


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 13

Sita while two boys had performed the roles of Ram and
Lakshman respectively. Whenever that girl came out, the
people rushed to touch her feet. It is not only the unlettered
but even the educated persons behaved like that. We are not
opposed to the shastras. Whenever I see people wearing rings
for controlling the ill-effect of various planets or wearing
threads round their necks for protecting themselves from the
evil spirits, I at once guess that the uneducated Seyanas (Tantriks)
have held even the educated people in their grip. These Seyanas
have set up their business centers at various places.
One of my Naamis is a teacher. He told me that one
shastriji was his colleague. One day, he came and resigned
from his post. I asked him what he had done. He had been
earning more than twenty thousand rupees from his job. The
fellow replied that he had started holding satvahs (a week
long Katha reciting programme). He had sought the services
of a boy whom he paid Rs. fifty to hundred per day. He
himself earned Rs. 50,000/- per day. That is to say 3-4 lakh
rupees per Satvah. Our Nami asked him who motivated him
to do so. He said that his cousin couldn’t pass even the 8th
standard. He used to sell vegetables. He became a shastri.
Now he had amassed a huge wealth. Even the ministers
showed respect to him. He was not having a good character.
Seeing all this, he decided to give up his job and soon wearing
a Dhoti (a piece of cloth used to wrap the lower part of the
body) and with a scripture in hand, he began to hold satvahs.
These people have nothing to do with spiritualism. The media
also highlights such hypocrites. Many historians also do so.
This has an ill effect on the innocent people. Earlier, the
people were frightened of swine flue and wearing of a mask
was perhaps the safety measure. Masks worth Arabs of rupees
were sold. This frightening situation was created by the media
alone. Our media acts in a very irresponsible manner. If


14 Sahib Bandgi

someone says, Manmohan Singh ji has developed horns, then
the latter has to deny any such development. He has also to
show to the public as well. What does all this mean? Once
these people spread a rumour that guns and gold biscuits were
found in the Ranjri Ashram and that Ranjri wala is sent to the
Tihar Jail. Then the people began to phone me about all this, I
said that these people were giving publicity to us in their own
manner. These media persons knowingly or unknowingly help
in the spread of militancy as well by highlighting even small
happenings. After all, why do these person behave in this
manner? This is because they have commercialised this,
otherwise, noble job. Even if someone elopes with his
granddaughter, they will make it a news. They will continue to
repeat it by the time they have some other news to broadcast.
They need to reform their behavior and mentality.
Often you will find people taking a bath in some pond in
order to remove their diseases. Doing so, they add more diseases
to themselves instead of getting rid of the one they already
suffer from. Even respectable persons begin to do so. It is the
media that misleads them in such matters. All of us are living
in the atmosphere of blind faith. The appearance of blue spots
on the bodies of women is taken as an indication of Jalbeer. In
fact, it is due to some defect in the menstrual period. What
sort of a Jalbeer it is! It doesn’t cross the boundary of Jammu.
This is nothing but an attempt at creating misconceptions. Sahib
Kabir says—
Yeh Kewal Bhram Ke Utpati.
They create misconception
The hypocrites boycotted Sahib Kabir simply because
he exposed their hypocrisy of befooling the people. He was
called unlettered fellow though, at present, about 50 crore
people accept his views. I am not against anyone. People
can be seen collecting donations in the name of functions.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 15

They are expert in such things. I am all praise for a cheat even.
He uses his intellect in befooling the people. A great cheat,
Natwar lal was imprisoned in Bhopal jail. Afterwards, he was
sent to Nepal. When he was presented in the court of Bhopal,
the judge asked where his lawyer was. He said that he had no
money to arrange for a lawyer. The judge said that a case of
forgery (420) was registered against him. He asked the judge
what forgery (420) meant. The judge said that he had, at first,
bought some watches from a shop and afterwards, he had bought
watches worth 10 lakh rupees. The cheque he gave to the
shopkeeper were bounced. He told the judge that his (judge’s)
bank balance must also have shown some decrease on some
occasions and the cheques must also have got bounced. What
for he was put in prison? Then the judge told him that he had
fled from the Kanpur prison. He replied that even a bird when
put in a prison would try to fly away. He also did the same. He
was a wise man. He requested the judge to let him go. Then the
judge told him that he had committed an act of cheating. He said
that everyone bought a thing for rupees ten and sold the same
for rupees 100. This was business and he was a business man.
He was very shrewd. He was to be taken to Delhi in
connection with some case. Four or five months before that,
he enacted a drama. He said that his legs were not functioning
well. He was seated on a wheel chair. He was to be taken
by train. One inspector and two policemen were
accompanying him. At the station, the inspector left to have
some food. He asked the policemen to keep a watch on him.
Soon after one of them went to buy a cigarette. Now there
was only one police man left. Natwar Lal told him that it
was much hot and he wanted to have some cold drink. Both
of them would take it. The fellow went to bring the cold
drink. When he returned, he found the wheel chair empty.
Just see, how claver he was!


16 Sahib Bandgi

That is why I say that the hypocrites are misleading the
people. There is need to be cautious. At Birpur, a seyana
(Tantric)used to hurl abuses at me. He was busy with his
job of befooling the people. Somehow, one of his sons came
in contact of one of my Namis. The boy was wise and he
was blessed with Naam. After some days, he brought his
mother and sisters as well. He asked his father also to get
blessed with Naam as the mode of worship preached by
Sahibji was a rare one. His father said that he knew Sahibji.
Whatever he spoke was truth and truth alone. The boy was
startled to hear this. He asked his father why he was still
engaged in his profession? The father said that that very
profession had helped him support his family. Ranjri wala
had caused a great set back to his profession. The rush of
people coming to him had fallen. Anyhow, later on, he as
well was blessed with Naam.
These seyanas befool and loot the people in every possible
way. They are forced to do so because they find themselves
unfit for any other job. In such cases there is 99% fraud.
The illness of a lady is attributed to the appearance in her
the spirit of her deceased mother-in-law or some other relative.
There was an old man in Pallanwala. He left his house
for some unknown place. The people spread the rumour that
he had committed suicide. After some time, his wife fell ill.
The seyanas said that the spirit of the old man had made its
entry in her. They suggested them to construct a place in
the name of gods. 40 years have passed. The seyanas began
to beat the drums and the people started assembling there.
The nephew of that fellow was transferred to Doda. He saw
the fellow in a temple. Finding his appearance resembling
with that of his own father, he asked him the place he belonged
to. He reported the matter to the elders of his family. They
went and brought him back. Returning back, he found that


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 17

the family members had taken him as dead and the seyanas had
entangled them in th net of Hatya. He asked the seyanas what
fraud they had been playing.
His wife had no answer to his questions. You can imagine
the extent of fraud for yourself.
A person had to visit the court for a period of 15 years
simply to give a proof of his being alive. His brother had
got even a death certificate prepared in his name. After getting
it certified by the sarpanch, he had grabbed his land as well.
The fellow seemed to be helpless in giving a proof of his
being alive.
Dhann Niranjan Tero Durbar.
Jahan Tanik Na Neyaye Vichar.
Oh Niranjan! your durbar is strange, indeed. One can’t
hope to have any justice here.
If someone declares that the wearing of a particular bangle
round the wrist can bring smiles on the face of issueless
women, the people begin to throng there. The fact is that all
the ladies are not fit for giving birth to babies. This defect is
present in some males as well. Some women are in a position
to give birth to children every year while others can give
birth to only one or two children. Those who are not in a
position to give birth to children, fall in the net of the
hypocrites. Through my Satsang I ask you to be cautious.
The hypocrites are not our enemies. They have chosen this
profession as a means of earning their livelihood. They can’t
give up easily. Our approach is positive towards all.
One thief became my Naami. He was very charitable.
He had in him one virtue. It helped the poor with the money
he looted and cleared their debts. He travelled by an auto.
One day, he gave me Rs. 100. At that time, my salary was
rupees 50 per month. He requested me to have some fruit
on the way. I did not respond and kept silent. He again


18 Sahib Bandgi

repeated his request. He wanted me to agree to his request.
I replied in negative. He asked the reason thereof. I said that
he hadn’t earned the money in a righteous way. He felt very
sad to hear it and said that even an enlightened person like
me was saying so. He said that his labour and efforts for
earning money were harder than that of mine. In fact, his
earnings were more rightful than even a farmer’s. I asked
how he could say so. He said that he had to risk his life
while committing a theft in someone’s house. If caught, the
persons like him have to face the wrath of the public as well
who, after giving them a good thrashing, hand them over to
police. Sometimes, they have to jump from two or three storied
buildings. These were the views he expressed in favour of his
mode of living. I told him that theft is a wrong act. People kept
some part of their money for the marriage, training or such like
occasions of their children. How much disturbed and painful
would such a fellow, whose wealth he stole, feel. Had he ever
thought how much hard life a prostitute had to lead?
Just imagine the compulsions under which a lady is
forced to surrender her body to others. Anyhow, I advised
him to do some other job. He said that he knew no other job
and had been doing that very job from the very beginning.
He robbed the rich and distributed the money among
the poor. I asked him to give me a word that he won’t indulge
in such acts. He gave the word. Then he began to cut wood
at some saw mill. He was a strong fellow. One day, he met
me and said that it was a very difficult job. I told him that
he would feel so in the beginning but afterwards he would
become habitual to it. He took drugs. He had grown weak.
He requested me to let him commit thefts for some more
days. I told him that he wouldn’t do so and said that I would
help him. I bought a house for him. He said that I won’t be


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 19

able to bear his expenses. I assigned him the job of keeping a
watch in my Ashram. He never committed a theft there. He
said that he was putting me to trouble and wanted to let him go.
But I didn’t let him go and in fact, I had turned him like a sage.
Basey Kusang Chahat Kushal, Kahat Rahim Badsos.
Mahima Ghati Samudar Ki, Ravan Basyo Pados.
Rahimji says that a wrong fellow in the neighbourhood
can have ill-effect on others. Settling of Ravan in the
neighbourhood marred the dignity of the sea.
One day, I asked him if everything was fine. He said
that he became care free. He had only a son to look after. I
told him that I would take care of him. I arranged for his
education and got him married as well. He proved to be a
good fellow with nice and pleasing nature like that of his
father.
I told him that whole of the body was blood itself. When
some part of blood comes out, we say, “Oh! I have lost my
blood.”
This body in any respect not a Soul. As such, we can’t
call any part of it as Soul. The Soul is immortal whereas
this body is perishable. If this body can’t be called as Soul,
then what can be said about it?
Sometimes, you say that such and such friend of your’s
is a very noble person. However, My views in this regard
are different. On what basis can you say that your friend is
good or bad? In this regard Sahib Kabir says—
Bura Jo Dekhan Main Gaya, Bura Na Milya Koye.
Jo Dil Khoja Aapna, Mujh Se Bura Na Koye.
I went in search of some wicked person but I failed to
find one. When I looked within my ownself, I found that
none else was more wicked than myself.
I think none can be called as a noble person. Only the


20 Sahib Bandgi

enlightened Souls are noble. I’ll explain as to why we call them
as noble.
Man is very dirty. Apart from the body, there is one
more thing to be observed. This is the individuality. A man
is known not by his features alone but by his individuality
as well. Now let’s again turn to the question as to why does
man become good or bad. My questions appear to be simple
but you will feel perspired in finding an answer to them.
The individuality includes Mind, intellect, lust, anger, greed,
attachment and ego as well. These are not good associations.
These are considered as vices. These are to be found in every
person. All these have to be considered while saying
something about the individuality. Man is not in a position
to gain control over these vices on his own. On the other
hand, the spiritually enlightened persons have control over
such vices. That is why we call none else but the spiritually
enlightened Souls as noble.

#### 4. O Man! crush your ego

Dharam Dassji put a very beautiful question to Sahib Kabir.
Dharam Dass Vinve Ker Jori. Sahib Kahiye Mukti Ki Dori.
O Sahib! kindly tell me the technique I should adopt
to seek liberation from the worldly ocean of life.
This Soul has not been tied with some rope or chain. It
has, rather, been entangled in the mayaic net by the Mind.
Just try to imagine the unique and complex system of this
Maya. You know that the world is like a dream, still you
take it as a real one. Man, even inspite of knowing that he is
a Soul, is living as a body.
Yeh Pinjda Nahin Tera Hansa, Yeh Pinjda Nahin Tera.
O Hansa! this bodily cage doesn’t belong to you.
There is no evidence of virtues of a Soul in anyone. Our
eyes see man who is not a Soul. All take birth from the womb
of the mother. This universe is created out of lustful activities.
So no trace of any virtue related to the Soul is to be seen in
anyone. What is the formation of our body. You know that
the trees bear fruit and the seed is present in every fruit. The
infant in the womb of its mother remains connected with
the muscular tube of the mother’s navel in a manner a fruit
remains connected to the branch of the tree. Thus it is the
blood of the mother that nourishes the child. The organs like
eyes, nose and ear etc. are formed out of it.
It is the blood of the mother that helps in the making
of nails, hands, eyebrows and fingers etc. The blood is same
at every part of the body. Once my finger was injured. Blood
began to flow out of it. I asked the doctor to stitch it. As much
blood was coming out of it, the doctor asked me not to look
there. Afterwards, he told me that I had shown a great patience.
These things are unrelated to the Soul. We make
assessment based on these very things. Suppose you pick
up an apple and say it is about 200 gram. How did it happen?
It clearly shows that earlier as well, you had picked up
21


22 Sahib Bandgi

something weighing 200 gm. It is your memory that enabled
you to have an estimate of weight.
It clearly shows that your assessment of your own self
is not correct. You assess yourself based on your behavior
and thoughts in childhood. However, it is not you who
performed those activities. The Soul is different from the Mind
and intellect. You are not what you think you are. Suppose
you give food to someone and ask about what it is. The fellow
tells only after tasting it. If you ask him what more it contains,
he will says that it has tomatoes as well. When you further
ask him as to what more does it contain, the fellow says that
it has chilies, salt, oil etc. Guru Nanak Dev ji says—
Tu Main Nu Maar Muka Bandeya.
O Man, crush your ego.
Sahib Kabir says—
Maya Mari Na Munn Mara, Mer Mer Gaya Sharir.
Asha Trishna Na Mui, Kah Gaye Sahib Kabir.
Even after taking repeated birth, man fails to gain control
over Mind and Maya. Desires of one or the other kind
continue to haunt him.
The memory in man helps him to recognise his relations
and other near and dear ones. His brain helps him in the
process of thinking. This is certainly not the Soul. It means
all that we experience is nothing but a farce. We are living
under great misconceptions. All this is the play of our shrewd
Mind. Sahib Kabir says—
Teen Lok Mein Munn Hi Viraji.
Tahi Na Chehnat Pandit Qazi.
The Muslim and the Hindu priests don’t seem to know
that it is the Munn that has its abode in all the 3 lokas.
Such knowledge is called as spiritualism. The stories of
the days gone by have nothing to do with spiritualism. That
is to say, our individuality itself is a big farce. Our Soul is
hidden beneath this individuality. All that is needed is to crush
the rising waves of ego.

#### 5. Inner Purity Gives Outer Purity

Yeh jug rain basera.
Life in this world is just like the spending of a night
in an Inn.
In this world we find people of different age groups. Some
are small, some are grown up while others are old. If you
try to ask some elderly person as to how did he spend his
life, he would certainly say that he is surprised at the pace
the hours of life are moving ahead. The younger ones are
living in the hope of seeing what lies ahead. This life is like
the bubble of water. In fact, all of us are living in a world of
dreams. You have attained many bodies. This is a clear
indication of the fact that the life in this universe is just like
spending of a night in an inn.
On one occasion, I carried on a cleanliness operation at
Akhnoor. The weed grass was to be burnt. The Namis were
burning the grass at different places. I asked them to do so
at one place only. They continued to bring the grass to that
place for burning as long as I was there. However, as soon
as I went away, they lighted the fire at some other place as
well. My sole purpose of asking them to burn the grass at
one place was to avoid any unnecessary loss to the trees or
to the small creatures on the ground. When I returned to that
place, I saw the fire burning at the other place as well. Flames
were rising high. In the meantime, a he-sparrow and its female
partner came there. They were looking to that burning spot.
Probably, they had their young ones there. They were unable
to go underneath the fire. I asked who had lighted the fire.
None of the fellows spoke.
Just see! how much love they had for their children. Don’t
think it is you alone who love your children. In every creature,
the Soul takes the body as its own self and shows love for

```

```

24 Sahib Bandgi

it. Many poisonous insects crawl. We think they feel pain in
doing so. If you try to kill them, they will try to escape. You
should have a high thinking. This will enable you to
experience the spiritual element. Why do you forget this
journey of 84 lakh yunies? Man forgets all this because
his individuality has been made so.
Life is short. Still man has loaded it heavily. Man behaves
like a dictator as well. Try to look within you to find if you
behave in the same manner. Man tries to influence others
with the power of his wealth, power, status or learning. During
my journey as well, I find strong fellows behaving very
arrogantly. Frightening the poor with the power of wealth
or learning is not good. This is a sort of violence. It clearly
shows that such people have no knowledge or
understanding of the Soul. We shouldn’t behave like this.
Trying to harm others through intrigues is a sort of crime.
The Soul is made to perform such indecent jobs. Earlier, I
used to believe in what others said. I was of the view that a
disciple won’t tell lies before a guru. I used to feel offended.
However, I don’t do so now. Try to think over what I am
saying. Do to others what you want others to do unto you.
If you want that none should beat you, you should also do
the same to others. If you want that none should abuse you,
you will also have to do the same to others and if you want
that everyone should respect you, you will have to respect
others. Always remember that you have to leave the world
eventually.
Do not try to tease others in any way. Whenever we take
out a rally, I ask the followers not to make a show of their
strength. Once a boy with a stick in hand was trying to stop
the moving vehicles. I told the disciples that it is they who
have to bother about the taking of rally. That boy has nothing
to do with it. He has to do the job assigned to him. You can
only request him with folded hands.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 25

First, we shall have to be polite. We should see to it that
none feels offended with our behavior. All of us follow others
blindly like sheep. We don’t deserve to be called as civilised
fellows. Our life style is not good.
One of my Namis visits Canada, America and other
countries. I asked him about the people there. He said that
they were much-disciplined people. Even if they have to take
their dogs for a stroll, they take a plastic bag with them. They
use it for collecting its urine. They don’t make their roads
dirty. If we look at our own people, we shall find that they
throw filth near the stations. The skins of the fruits and other
left over eatables are also thrown at the station itself. There
is every possibility of someone slipping over them. It clearly
shows how dirty we are. In fact, we do all sorts of things
that can harm others.
One person from Canada came for Naam diksha. He had
already sought the shelter of many gurus. He found everything
in our panth to his taste. Afterwards, he decided to go without
getting blessed with Naam. At this, D.C. Sahib asked him
the reason thereof. He said that the Guruji and the teachings
of the Panth were appreciable but the followers were not so
good. They don’t have good eating habits. In addition, their
behavior was not pleasing. After all, he had to mix up with
them.
Everyone likes to visit a home where the people are well
behaved and have good eating habits. I teach the followers
to be social as well.
None of us feels satisfied even inspite of having the
needed necessities of life. There is need to bring reforms in
this sphere. We behave like irresponsible persons. In European
countries, none will be found throwing the bits of cigarettes
or other such like dirty things on the road. It is taken as a
bad habit there. There is need to be cautious about all these
things.


26 Sahib Bandgi

I bought a Neel cow. I gave it the feed and milk as well.
It followed me wherever I went. It had understood that I was
taking care of it. When even an animal has the power to
understand, what is the problem with us. Only one who knows
how to fix concentration-Surti, can keep away from wrong
acts. I know everything about myself. I have never teased
or tortured anyone in any way. Try to remain in your natural
form. Whenever you do some wrong act, feel sorry for it. A
sage has beautifully spoken in this regard. It is not a great
thing or an act of bravery to refrain from causing harm to
others. It is an act of cowardice if we don’t stand against
those who torture others.
If you see a strong fellow thrashing a weak person, it is
your duty to ask him the reason thereof.
When everyone is awakened, the acts of violence and
crime will automatically fall. That fellow said that everyone
makes a research on his own life. Remember! it is difficult
to purify the Mind by any possible means.
Munn Hi Ahey Kaal Karala. Jeev Nachave Karey Behala.
Mind itself is Kaal that tortures Jiva in a very cruel
manner.
In gross form, it is the Indriyas that are Mind. On seeing
some good dish, the mouth waters. Such like is our physical
body. Then in subtle form, this Mind is present within us in
the form of lust, anger etc. In such circumstances, how can
we purify this Mind? The way to do so is not to co-operate
with it. Whenever it desires to do some wrong act, control
over it can play a positive role. There are many noble persons.
They succeed in controlling their wrong activities to some
extent only. Nevertheless, it can under no circumstances
become flawless.
You can clean some dirtiest thing with soap but I won’t
accept as true if someone claims to have purified the Mind.
At least, one should try to be polite in behavior and noble


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 27

in deeds. This much purification is necessary for all.
You sweep your house and clean your toilet. At least,
once a month you clean your drain. In the same manner, you
should try to purify dirt and filth of your heart. There is need
to pay attention to it. We should try to clean it to some extent.
It will make us social and polite. However, spiritualism
demands control over subtle vices as well.
The life-style of all of us is like that of animals. There
is need to bring an element of humaness in it. We shouldn’t
throw dirt in front of the houses of others. The sound of our
T.V. as well shouldn’t be loud. It can cause inconvenience
to others. Sometimes, in our Ashram, the Naamis play the
deck on a high tone. I advise them not to do so as we don’t
want to make others listen to the devotional songs in glory
of Sahib even against their willingness. I have directed them
to do so only for about 15 minutes after the Sun rise and
that too at a low volume. Such behavior is a reflection of
humaness. Now let’s turn to spiritualism. He who looks clean
and beautiful outwardly but is crooked from within, would
be exposed sooner or later. Remember! there is no kind of
worship greater than that of taking pity. Not to speak of snakes,
I don’t kill mosquitoes even. We have to live in the universe
in a very noble way.
Vaishnav Dharam Jaini Daya Mussalman Iktar.
Jub Ye Teenon Bhaye, Tub Paye Mera Deedar.
He whose religion is like that of a vaishnav, feeling of
pity like the Jains and worship of one God alone like the
Muslims, can have My vision.
All the three things are to be found in our panth. We
are, in the real sense, true vaishnavs. No guru asks his disciples
to become so. Turning you into noble Souls, I am taking you
to spiritual heights.


28 Sahib Bandgi

#### 6. None could know the identity of Param Purush

Kabir Ka Gaya Gaye Ga, Teen Lok Mein Mar Khaye Ga.
Kabir Ka Gaya Boojhe Ga, To Antargat Ko Soojhe Ga.
He who recites the sayings of Kabir, will face
humiliation in the world whereas he who tries to
understand the message contained in his sayings will be
able to understand and know what lies within.
Let’s see what is that which Sahib Kabir gave to the
world. First, he spoke about the limit to which the Sagun as
well as the Nirgun worship can take us. He was, rather, a
rationalist. The people have presented a wrong picture of
Sahib Kabir only for their selfish motives. This is because
he attacked the acts of hypocricy. Neither he felt afraid nor
hesitated. He exposed the hypocrites in a very simple and
natural way. The hypocrites spread rumours that he was a
married man and had a son, named Kamal and a daughter,
named Kamali. Also that Lohi was his wife. However, Sahib
Kabir himself revealed his identity in the following words.
Santo Avigat Se Chala Aya, Koyi Bhaid Maram Na Paya.
Na Hum Rahle Gharabvas Mein, Balak Hoyi Dikhlaya.
Kashi Tatt Srovar Oopar, Tahan Julaha Paya.
Na Hamre Maat Pita Hain, Na Ghar Girhi Dassi.
Kashi Mein Hum Prakat Bhaye, Jug Mein Ho Geyi Hansi.
Aane Takiya Ung Hamari, Ajar Amar Pur Dera.
Hukam Haisiyat Se Chaley Aye, Katan Yam Ka Phera.
O saints! I have come from a far off place. None has
been able to know of my identity. Without staying in the
womb of the mother, I appeared as a child. A weaver found
me in the pond at Kashi. Neither I have parents nor any wife.
I appeared at Kashi and all this has made me a laughing stock.

My abode is in Amarlok and I have come here as per the
dictates of Param Purush to save the jivas from the clutches
of yama.
At the time of his departure, he gave the proof of all
this to the worldly people. He had declared that he would
leave his body at Magghar on the eve of Magsudi Ekadshi.
He left his body before lakhs of people. No remains of his
physical body were found. He appeared on a flower and left
behind flowers.
His contribution in the social as well as spiritual field is
also worth mentioning.
When the sage Mridugal asked the messengers from
heaven the detail about heaven, the latter said that there were
great trees with beautiful and tasty flowers. One was free to
enjoy there any kind of fruit one liked. It clearly shows that
there as well the jiva is in the cage in a manner it is in this
universe. It does not live there as a Hansa.
Va Ghar Ki Sudh Koyi Na Batave, Jahvan Se Hansa Aya Hai.
None gives any information about the abode jiva has
come from.
There is a great secret related to the real abode of jiva.
Sahib Kabir revealed it. He talked about all the different kinds
of physical bodies in detail. He told the means one could
adopt to reach Brahm Lok even. One can find a mention of
these four kinds of salvation in different panths and religions.
That loka of Param Purush is indeed a very rare loka.
Ved Kateb Par Nahin Pavat, Kahan Sunan Se Neyara Hai.
Even the Vedas and other holy scriptures don’t throw
any light on that rare kind of Loka Amarlok.
Us Manjle Nazdik Nehin Kaal Ka Phanda.
There is no grip of Kaal on that loka.
Sahib Kabir has talked about all the 21 Brahmands. Then
why was he opposed? He gave a severe blow to the irrational


30 Sahib Bandgi

and unscientific rites, rituals and beliefs. The hypocrites of
all kinds got united to declare that he was an unlettered fellow.
They tried to defame him in every possible manner. Just as
in politics, every politician tries to defame his rival the
hypocrites also coined different stories to defame him. They
did so to prevent the people from going to him. In fact, the
people failed to understand all that Sahib Kabir spoke about
the Loka that lies beyond the 3 lokas.
Sar Shabad Paye Bina, Kaga Hans Na Hoyi.
None can change his crow like nature into that of a
Hansa without getting blessed with Sar Naam.
Kankar Patthar Jode Ker, Masjid Leyi Banaye.
Ta Chadi Mulla Baang De, Bahira Huwa Khudai.
After making a mosque out of the collected pebbles and
stones, the Muslim priest creies aloud as if God were deaf.
At that time, the people were engrossed in two kinds of
worship—Sagun as well as Nirgun. Sahib Kabir talked about
the mode of worship that was far unique from these two.
Did he speak against the 4 kinds of salvation? Did he speak
against the status of guru or the recitation of Naam? Certainly
not. He only spoke about the limit of each. Regarding the 4
kinds of salvations he said that those were within the power
of Niranjan and the jiva will be reborn after enjoying the
fruit for some definite period of time. These four kinds of
salvation are a sort of prison house. The Soul living in the
bodily cage feels much frustrated. No person can feel
comfortable in a prison even if he is provided with all sorts
of facilities. He will remain sad and frustrated. It is sin to
place any animal in a cage. It is a violation of its right to
freedom. Likewise, this universe is like a cage in which all
the jivas have been imprisoned.
Then there are forests—big and small to be found. These
are the abodes of the animals. They are also in prison. Some


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 31

animals are free to move within a radius of 10-15 km. They
can’t go beyond it. How can we call them free. Then there
are big forests that extend upto a radius of 300-400 km. These
are like the national sanctuaries. The animals living there
have to remain within that limit. The jivas can’t be allowed
to cross this limit. Then how can we call them as free? The
same is true of the 4 kinds of salvation as well. No jiva
enjoying the fruit there can stay there for ever. They are in
the grip of Niranjan who makes them dance to his tunes.
Sahib Kabir was a rare of scientist. Even today, many
panths and religions have adopted his sayings. Those who
commit acts of forgery and cheating, are sure to go to hell.
He has talked about the techniques that can help the devotees
attain the four kinds of salvation. No spiritual knowledge is
to be found in the abodes the devotees attain on the basis of
these salvations.
At that time, the hypocrites called him as an illiterate
fellow and made a fun of him. However, at present, the
scholars are making a research on what he said. Even the
scholars at that time misled the people regarding his greatness.
Likewise, the present day media also creates misconceptions
in the minds of people. Their association with one or the
other political party makes it do so. Taking note of it, the
supreme court has directed the media persons to perform their
job honestly and rightly.
Sahib Kabir talked about the presence of infinite number
of Brahmands and about the many suns and moons in this
Brahmand. Also, Sahib Kabir unfolded many secrets related
to the field of worship.
Avdhu Begum Desh Hamara Hai.
Ved Kateb Par Nehin Pavat, Kahan Sunan Se Neyara Ahai.
My abode is in Amarlok. That is a rare country. The Vedas
and other religious scriptures don’t have any knowledge about it.


32 Sahib Bandgi

Beyond the three lokas there lies Maha Shunya. Achint
lok, Soham lok and Ankur lok etc. lie in it. These lokas are
seven in number. Sahib Kabir gave a description of these
very very vast lokas. However, there is dissolution in these
lokas as well.
Akshay Purush Tahan Aap Viraje.
Nahin Tahan Kachhu Moh Aru Maya.
Nahin Tahan Parley Ki Chhaya.
Param Purush Himself resides there. No attachment or
Maya is to be found there. No dissolution takes place there.
There is one Akshay lok where there is dissolution.
Tahan Na Teen Gunan Ko Bheva.
Brahma Vishno Mahesh Na Tahvan.
There is nothing like the 3 Gunas (Tamas,Rajo and
Satwa). Even Brahma, Vishno and Mahesh are not to be found
there. These centres of devotion are not to be found there.
Nehin Tahan Jyoti Niranjan Raya.
Even Jyoti Niranjan has no existence there.
Those who preached all that was related to these deities,
felt hurt. In the interior of their heart, they might have taken
the teachings of Sahib Kabir as true. The hypocrites burn
the effigy of Ravan but they don’t make a description of the
virtues he possessed. He was born in a pristly family and
had a good knowledge of the Vedas. He was a great devotee
of Shivji. I am not describing the virtues of Ravan. I want
only to tell about the narrow thinking the worldly people
have. Sahib Kabir said nothing that was contrary to truth. In
the books as well, he is described as an unlettered weaver
who had a son, named Kamal. This is what is being impressed
upon the minds of the readers from the very beginning.
Kabir Ka Ghar Door Hai, Jaisi Lambi Khajoor.
Kabir’s abode, like that of a palm tree, is very very far
away.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 33

Tahan Na Jeev Tattav Ki Chhaya.
Nehin Tahan Dus Indri Nirmaya.
Kaam Krodh Madd Lobh Na Tahvan.
No embodied Jivas, elements, ten Indriyas, the vices
like lust, anger and greed etc. are to be found there.
All are afraid of death. Shivji, as per the desire of
Bhasmasur, blessed him with the power to kill anyone whom
he desired simply by placing his hand on the latter’s head.
The fellow ran after him (Shivji himself) so as to attain Parvati.
Then Shivji had to go to Vishnu for protection. That is to
say, Kaal doesn’t spare anyone. But Sahib Kabir says—
Kaal Kral Nikat Na Aave.
Kaal can’t dare to come near a devotee who gets
blessed with Sar Naam.
This strange thing hadn’t been heard before. When
copernicus said that the earth moves, he was awarded death
punishment.
Nahin Tahan Divas Rain Ki Chhahin.
There is no shade of day and night even.
All these appear due to the rotation of the earth. That is
to say, there is nothing like that to be found in this universe.
This universe has been created out of the 5 material elements.
However, there is no existence of 5 material elements there.
Pawan Na Pani Purush Na Nari,
Hadd Unhadd Tahan Nahin Vichari.
Air, water, male, female and even the musical notes are
not to be found there.
Shabad Kahaun To Shabdai Nahin.
Shabad Huwa Maya Ke Mahin.
There are no words even. They owe their existence to
Maya and this Maya has no existence there.
There is a special system in Bunk Nal. He who succeeds
in awakening it, can hear countless musical notes. None in


34 Sahib Bandgi
the world can play such a kind of music. At present, 70 kinds
of musical notes are to be found. These are present in the
Bunk Nal itself ( In human body). These musical notes are
so fascinating that one gets lost in them. None in the world
can play such a sweet flute as is being played within. The
sitar being played there is also of a very rare kind.
Many people boast of their qualification. They behave
with others in a rude manner. The yogis also boast of their
yogic powers. This is not good. A really great man is one
who doesn’t let the germs of ego breed within him. Insulting
others is a sort of violence.
Good looking people often behave in a rude manner with
those who don’t have good physical features. Wealthy persons
also have such a kind of ego. In fact, no sort of ego is good
for man.
Moti Maya Sub Tajai, Jheeni Taji Na Jaye.
Peer Paigambar Aulya, Jheeni Sub Ko Khaye.
It is easy to shun gross form of Maya like wife, son
and other relations but it is certainly not easy to shun the
subtle one. Even the Peers, Paigambars and Auliyas are
under the grip of ego, the subtle form of Maya.
Sabai Maan De Aap Amani.
A really great person is one who respects all but doesn’t
desire it for his ownself.
The Bunk Nal where a yogi listens to the musical notes,
is the middle part of the Sushuman nerve.
Every man wants to seek pleasures in life. However, what
sort of pleasures are to be found in the universe? All the
pleasures to be found in the universe are related to the Indriyas
(senses). Our Soul doesn’t enjoy these. Some like to enjoy
the taste of tongue. This tongue enjoys 6 kinds of taste. There
is a system in our tissues. The department related to the tongue
is a big one. Some like sweet eatables while others like sour


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 35

ones. It has no pleasures in itself. It only needs pleasure giving
things. Likewise, the eyes enjoy pleasure from beautiful
objects. In fact, the Soul likes to live in the world of real
pleasures. The worldly pleasures can’t provide it with the
real pleasures. As such, it remains at all the times, in search
of real pleasures. No pleasures of the 3 lokas except that
of Amarlok can satisfy it.
Just as a musk deer makes a search of musk in the herbs
and bushes, the Soul as well has been making a search of
pleasures at a wrong place.
The yogi reaches the place wherefrom he finds the
musical notes emanating. Holding on to the musical notes
and words, he makes a visit to various Lokas—big and small.
He gains experiences and with the passage of time, the worldly
pleasures lose their charm for him. He gets more and more
fascinated in the pleasures he derives from the musical notes.
Khavta Peevta Sovta Jagta, Kahain Kabir So Rahey Mahin.
Sahib Kabir says that a stage comes when the yogi
remains engrossed in these musical notes even while eating,
drinking, sleeping or awaking.
Some stop at this very level. They take these musical
notes as true Naam and God Himself. Nevertheless, the fact
is that these are not true Naam at all though a devotee can
derive pleasures from these.
Jaap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Marr Jaye.
Surti Samani Shabad Mein, Us Ko Kaal Na Khaye.
Recitation of Naam outwardly or inwardly and the
musical notes as well are perishable. It is only the soundless
sound that can’t be devoured by Kaal even.
Wherever there are musical notes, there is Maya. As
such, in no case it helps a devotee cross the worldly ocean.
The colours as well have nothing to do with the
attainment of salvation. Yellow colour is due to the earth,


36 Sahib Bandgi

white colour is due to water, blue due to air, red due to fire and
black due to sky. But the black one is not taken as a colour. So
only four colours are recognised. Other colours are obtained
by mixing these four colours. Sahib Kabir has told a very
scientific based truth. How can the colours exist in Amarlok
when there are no material elements to be found there?
There are many great scholars in the world. One Dr.
Hosla Parsad is a P.hd in Kabir’s philosophy. After getting
blessed with Naam, he said that the sayings of Sahib Kabir
I was talking about, were nowhere to be found. I told him
that the hypocrites had chosen only such sayings as could
serve their selfish motives. A beggar will recites his sayings
that serve his purpose.
Dhaan Diye Dhann Na Ghate, Kah Gaye Dass Kabir.
Sahib Kabir says that acts of charity don’t cause any loss
of wealth.
But he won’t say—
Mangan Maran Sman Hai, Matt Mango Koyi Bheekh.
Begging is just like dying. So none should beg.
If he says so, he won’t be able to serve his interest.
Likewise, the sagun worshippers have described Sahib as a
sagun worshipper while the Nirgun worshippers have
described him as a Nirgun worshipper. In this way, they have
misled the people. However, the fact is that Sahib Kabir was
far beyond these modes of worship.
In this regard, Dadu Dayal ji has beautifully said—
Koyi Sagun Mein Reejh Raha, Koyi Nirgun Thahraye.
Atpat Chal Kabir Ki, Mause Kahi Na Jaye.
Some are engaged in sagun worship while others are
engaged in Nirgun worship. However, the moves of Sahib
Kabir are very strange and it is not possible for me to give a
description of these.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 37

The Nirgun worshippers say—
Rus Gagan Gufa Mein Ajar Jharai, Bin Baja Jhankar Uthai.
From within the Bunk Nal, musical notes keep emanating
in a natural way.
They say, Sahib Kabir had said only this much. All others
selected only such sayings of Sahib Kabir as suited their
interests. None took note of all of his sayings.
Kabir Ka Gaya Gayega, To Teen Lok Mein Maar Khaye Ga.
Kabir Ka Gaya Bhoojega, To Antargat Ko Soojhega.
He who recites the sayings of Kabir, will have to face
humiliation in the entire 3 lokas whereas he who understands
the message inherent in these, will be able to know about
the secrets lying within.
Thus the wrong interpretation of Sahib Kabir’s sayings
created misconceptions in the minds of the people but he
unfolded many secrets.
Pind Brahmand Ko Tahan Na Lekha.
Loka Lok Tahan Na Dekha.
That rare loka is beyond the limit of physical body and
the Brahmand.
Kind of Lokas are not to be found there.
Butter is obtained by churning curd and ghee is obtained
by heating butter. Likewise, air is present in the body. At
first, it is exhaled. After this, the Soul is taken out of the
breath. King Janak practised unmuni Mudra (posture). He
knew the technique of moving out of the body. However, he
didn’t know how to escape from the grip of Mind. Afterwards,
he had to seek the shelter of Ashtavakara. After the Unmuni
Mudra comes the Khechri Mudra. Brahma, Vishno and
Mahesh practise this Mudra. Much concentration is needed
for it. That is why Shivji remains in meditation for 4 yugas
even. The practice of this Mudra enables a devotee to separate
himself from his breath.


38 Sahib Bandgi

Pawan Ko Palat Kar, Shunya Mein Ghar Kiya.
There is need to reverse the direction of airs and to
concentrate them in Shunya.
Surti Ke Dand Se, Ghair Munn Pawan Ko.
There is need to control the airs and the Mind with
the power of Surti.
Phair Ulta Chaley, Dhar Au Udhar Vich Dhyan Lavai.
Kahain Kabir So Sant Nirbhay Huwa,
Janam Au Maran Ka Bhram Bhanai.
The air has to be controlled with the stick of
concentration. This will help the devotee to turn it in the
reverse order. The concentration has to be fixed at a place
in-between the earth and the sky. Doing so, the air that was
coming from the shunya into the navel region, will begin to
move in the reverse direction. It will move towards the 8th
plexus. Gradually, the concentration will begin to get absorbed
in Sushumna. At this stage, the devotee begins to feel afraid.
The Mind frightens him saying he would die.
It tries to disturb the concentration. If it gets disturbed,
the breath again begins to move downward. The whole labour
is thus wasted. That is to say, the Munn prevents the devotee
from fixing his concentration at the 10th or the 11th dwara.
Sushuman Madhya Basey Niranjan,
Moondha Dusvan Dwara.
Uske Ooper Makar Taar Hai, Chado Samhar Samhara.
Sushuman is the abode of Niranjan. Seated there, he
has closed the 10th dwara. Above the 10th aperture lies
the wire of Surti. There is need to move here in a very
careful manner.
The Mind tries to keep the jiva as a body. Munn-Maya
try their level best to prevent it from knowing itself.
Tahan Silhali Gail Hai, Chadoon To Gir Gir Padoon.
Uthoon Surit Samhar, Charan Aage Dharoon.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 39

That path is very slippery and each time I try to ascend,
I fall down. I can put my foot forward only by fixing
concentration.
Mind will frighten you with the very thing you are afraid
of. If you are frightened from great heights, it will silently
remind you of any such incident connected with it. You will
feel sad and your concentration will get disturbed. You will
come to your original position and will say that you attained
nothing from meditation. However, you shouldn’t feel
frustrated. The Mind desires that you shouldn’t even think
of sitting in meditation. If you fix your concentration in a
proper manner, you won’t be able to move even your hands
and feet. It is at this very stage that the Mind will tell you
that you are moving towards darkness. You have to bear in
mind that there is darkness within the Sushumna. If you
remain stead-fast, you will realise that you are nothing but
meditation alone. Such like realisation can’t be had if you
fix your concentration in the Bunk Nal or in Agochari. I have
asked you to fix your concentration at a place 1¼ hands above
the head so that you may realise that you are not a body.
Mind doesn’t like such a thing to happen. That is why it
tries to prevent you from meditating in such a way.
Jadd Chetan Hai Granthi Padd Gayi.
Yadyapi Mithya Chhutat Kathinayi.
The gross body and the subtle Soul seem to have
developed a knot. Though it is nothing but a farce, yet it
is not easy to untie the same.
Deep concentration will help in bringing the breath to a
single point. After this, you will move into the inner world.
The gross awakening (Jagret Awastha)will come to an end.
You will get another body. It will be just like attaining of
the Maha Pragya state. This is a very strange state. This
attaining of another body is just like the attaining of a subtle


40 Sahib Bandgi

body in sleep. The awakening and the pleasures increase. There
is the feeling of attaining miraculous powers. You will also be
able to see the light equivalent to that of the crores of suns.
You will realise as if you have attained the ultimate reality. In
this connection, Sahib Kabir says—
Koyi Koyi Pahuncha Brahm Lok Mein, Dhar Maya Le Aayi.
Some devotee succeeds in attaining Brahm lok. But, once
again, Maya brings him back.
The devotee, who experiences these miraculous powers,
begins to make an expression of them. Thus he fails to move
out of the limit of Munn. He fails to know the secret related
to the 11th dwara.
Us Ke Aage Bheid Hamara, Janey Ga Koyi Janan Hara.
Kahain Kabir Janeyga Vo Hi, Ja Par Kripa Satguru Ki Hoyi.
Sahib Kabir says that only some deserving devotee
who has with him the blessings of a Satguru, can know
the secret related to him.
In this way Sahib Kabir unfolded many secrets.
Adi Purush Ko Tahan Na Thana. Yeh Charit Eko Nahin Jana.
None could know the secret related to the abode of
Param Purush.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 41

#### 7. None knows the secrets inherent in this body

Sahib Kabir has beautifully described this body—
Avdhu andh dhundh andhiyara. Koyi janey ga janan hara.
Ya Ghat Bheetar Sooraj Chanda, Ya Hi Mein Nau Lakh Tara.
Is Ghat Bheetar Heerey Moti, Isi Mein Parkhan Hara.
Is Ghat Bheetar Brahma Vishno, Shiv Sankadi Apara.
Ya Ghat Bheetar Kaam Dhenu Hai, Kalap Briksh Ik Nyara.
Ya Ghat Bheetar Riddhi Siddhi Ke, Bharey Atal Bhandara.
Only some knowledgeable devotee can know about the
miracles inherent within this body. There are sun, moon, nine
lakh stars, diamonds, pearls, the assayers of these precious
stones, Brahma, Vishno, Shiv, Sankadi, Kaam Dhenu (a rare
cow), Kalap virksh (a rare tree) and other unending sources
of comforts, pleasures and powers.
Even the scientists have not been able to gather full
information about this miraculous body. They have not been
able to know the powers hidden within it and the principle
under which this physical body has been functioning. Sahib
Kabir says—
Sub Ki Gathri Lal Hai, Koyi Nahin Kangal.
Every human being has pearls with him. None is to be
found devoid of wealth.
Shiv Gorakh So Pach Pach Harey,
Is Kaya Ka Bheid Na Paye.
Even Shiv ji and Gorakh Nath, inspite of their earnest
attempts, failed to know the secrets related to this body.
Though it is a fact that many miraculous powers are
inherent in this body, yet there is need to understand and
know that many opposing forces are also present in it. Sahib
Kabir says—

```

42 Sahib Bandgi

Vish Amrit Rahat Ik Sunga.
The poison as well as the nectar is present in this body.
Man wants to have Soul realisation but he has not been
in a position to know the way the Soul has been behaving
within the body. Man has no means and techniques to know
the way the powers related to God are working. Nevertheless,
he is the only creature who has the right to know all these
things (Not even Gods of the heaven). The holy scriptures
also say so. Even the gods desire to attain this human body.
This is because it is the only body that can help jiva attain
salvation. There is some definite reason behind calling this
human body as rare. There are many things that need
clarification. Before thinking of the ways and means regarding
the attainment of salvation, it is important to have knowledge
of the bondage in which the Soul has been held and the powers
that are at work within the body. Man has the faculties to
attain many miraculous powers. Though sleeping man has
the power in him, yet he is not in a position to make use of
it. So to say, these powers remain hidden. Likewise, the Soul
has power in it but because of its being in the grip of Mind
and Maya, its power remains hidden. During sleep you can’t
hear even if your ears are open. Further, you can’t tell about
the foul or sweet smell inspite of the nostrils remaining open.
These organs can’t make use of the powers they possess.
Likewise, we make use of our physical powers alone. We
do not make any use of our spiritual power.
There is no dearth of physical power in man. There are
Indriyas — 5 Karam Indriyas and 5 Geyan Indriyas — in
this human body. This body is made out of the mother’s blood
and father’s semen. That is why it is called as perishable.
There are 25 natures related to it. Every mateiral element
has 5 natures related to it.
The first one is the earth element. All of us have bones,


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 43

flesh, skin, pores and nails. The 2nd one is the water element.
It can be seen in the form of spittle, blood, perspiration, semen
and urine. The 3rd one is the fire element. It can be seen in
the form of hunger, thirst, laziness, sleep and yawning. The
fourth one is the air element. It can be seen in the form of
contraction, expansion, walks, speech and force. The fifth
one is the sky element. It can be seen in the form of Juice,
smell, word, appearance and touch. So to say, all of us have
these 5 elements and 25 forms related to these.
We walk with our feet, work with our hands, pass urine
through Penis, pass faeces through anus and eat through
mouth. These are the five Karamendriyas. The eyes, ears,
nose, mouth and the skin are called as the five Geyanendriyas.
Mouth behaves as a Karamendriya as well as a Geyanendriya.
We use it to get knowledge about 6 kinds of Juices. The nose
gives us knowledge about smell; the ears give knowledge
about words; the skin gives knowledge about hot and cold
whereas the eyes give the knowledge about different kinds
of sights.
A vehicle has wheels as well as other parts in it. All of
these work in unison to enable the vehicle move. Likewise,
the body shaped vehicle works with the co-operation of all
of its organs. If, by chance, we are about to stumble against
some obstacle, it is the eyes that help us to escape from any
major injury. These sight the obstacles lying in the path and
inform us accordingly. Thus all these organs help us in doing
various kinds of jobs. The nose helps us in our breathing
process. What a sort of life would be without it. If some
eatable gets spoiled, it is not the eyes or ears but the nose
that tells us about it. The nose occupies the place near the
mouth so that we may be able to first smell the eatable before
putting it in mouth. The whole structure of the body has been
made in a very wise manner. It has miraculous powers in it.


44 Sahib Bandgi

That is why it has been called as a Naraini chola. Our mouth
helps us in speaking but, without words, it would have been
difficult for us to make others understand us.
The skin is the fifth Geyanendri. The outer skin of
the fruit helps in keeping it safe. Likewise, our skin helps in
keeping our internal organs safe. The skin gives us the
knowledge about the smoothness or the hardness of a thing.
There is some power that controls it. It is gross in form and
is not in a position to work on its own. We hear the sound
coming out of a speaker. But the sound is being produced
by some person. The speaker acts as a medium only. Likewise,
the Karam Geyanendriyas are only the medium whereas the
controller of these is someone else. The scientists are of the
view that it is the brain that controls all the activities of the
body. But the brain itself is a collection of tissues. These
tissues don’t function on their own. There is some definite
force behind that is responsible for the functioning of the
brain. Our hands and feet perform their respective functions.
But these owe their functioning to some power. If you injure
your finger, the finger doesn’t tell you about the pain at the
spot of injury. This is because the fingers don’t possess the
needed system for the purpose. In fact, the brain realises the
pain. Our brain is a good controller of the whole of our body.
It keeps all the organs safe.
In case of attack on any part of the body, the brain
orders the hands to save it. The hands have no power to think.
If the feet move in some wrong direction, you save yourself.
The feet have no power to see. It is the eyes that saw all this
but there was some power within that actually took the needed
step. It passed on the order. It is, in fact, the Mind that is
the controller. It has four forms — Mind, Intellect, Memory
and Ego. These are the four subtle Indriyas. The Munn
expresses a desire; the intellect makes the planning for its


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 45

fulfilment; the chitt (remembrance) tells about the place from
where the needed material can be had whereas the ego steps
in to actually perform the work. Man spends whole of his
life without knowing about the secrets inherent in the body.
When man is not in a position to understand even the powers
related to body, how he can be expected to have knowledge
of the spiritual powers.
All the desires are related to Mind. The Soul has nothing
to do with this. All the emotions surfacing out are also related
to the body. Even the psychologists are at a loss to know
the reason behind the surfacing of emotions from within.
All of a sudden, man expresses a desire to have some
eatable (say a mango or some sweet). Why did such a desire
come out?
We have no knowledge about it. Sometimes you desire
to have a walk. Why did this desire make its appearance?
Sometimes the people feel a desire to watch some movie.
How did this desire appear? In fact, man wastes away the
precious moments of his life in the fulfilment of such
unnecessary desires. All the desires are body related. The
brain informs about the benefits of the minerals and vitamins
present in the mango or some other fruit. That is why the
desire to have them arises in the body. Moreover, the brain
also tells that the particular fruit is a seasonal one. No desire
would surface about eating a fruit that is not a seasonal one.
None has ben able to understand these emotions in a right
manner.
The six kinds of juices are — sour, sweet, sharp, bitter,
saltish and insipid. Wherefrom did these appear? Why does
man express desire for these? The five elements in our body
are — water, fire, air, earth and sky. There is need to keep
these in balance. These are getting automatically balanced.
The six kinds of juices are produced from these very elements.


46 Sahib Bandgi

Water is Khara in taste. The scientists are wrong in calling
water as colourless and tasteless. Of course, it has no smell.
However, it has a definite color and taste. If someone places
Kerosene oil before you, you can at once recognise it.
Likewise, you can recognise water from its very appearance.
That is to say, you recognised both these from their respective
color. Water is white in color.
Shavet Rung Hai Neer Ko, Kharo Is Ko Swad.
The water is white in color and Khara in taste.
The color of fire is red and its taste is sharp. Air is blue
in color and bitter in taste. The sky far above looks blue due
to the blue color of air. During vomit one belches as well.
One feels a sour taste. How did it happen when you didn’t
take any sour article?
Earth has a sweet taste. Sometimes, the children take
earth. Don’t let them do so. This earth contains poisonous
substances as well. We make use of Dhatoora (a plant) which
also sprouts from within the earth. This poison doesn’t appear
from the sky. Sow the lemon if you desire to produce some
sour thing and sow the sugarcane if you desire to produce
some sweet thing out of the earth. Everything is present in
it. The same is the case of our body as well.
The sky has a insipid taste and a black color. In short,
it is the duty of the brain to make good the loss of any needed
color. If you feel a desire to have some saltish article, you
at once run for the satisfaction of your desire. You don’t bother
to know why you went ahead with the motive of satisfying
your desire.
That is to say, some power has been running the body
in such a clever manner that none can know of it. Sometimes,
after consuming some tasty eatable, man says he has enjoyed
it much. However, the tongue has no power to enjoy. It is
the brain that made him say so.

Teen Lok Mein Munn Hi Viraji. Tahi Na Cheehnat Pandit Qazi.
Munn is present in the entire 3 lokas but the Pandits
(Hindu priests) and the Qazis (Muslim priests) have unable
to know of it.
The whole system related to these Indriyas is not easy
to understand. He who succeeds in having a knowledge of
the whole system related to the body, becomes enlightened.
Just as Soul is the basis of this body, ignorance is the basis
of this universe.
Just as the body can’t function without the Soul, the
universe also vanishes after the attainment of real knowledge.
This is because ignorance itself is the very Soul of this
universe. When the Soul comes to know of its real identity,
it will stop taking eatables and running after lustful activities.
It will stop carrying the load of this body. As it will stop all
sorts of works, it clearly shows that ignorance alone is the
basis of this universe.
What is ignorance? What is its basis? Ignorance means
having no knowledge. Then what is knowledge? It is nothing
but information/practical experience. For instance, if you say
you saw someone, it is knowledge. Light is the basis of this
knowledge. It means, light is full of knowledge whereas
darkness is full of ignorance. If there is darkness all round,
you won’t be able to recognise anything. Darkness is the
cause of ignorance.
Tamso Maa Jyotirgamaya.
Lead us from darkness to light.
As the 5th element itself is darkness, the entire Brahmand
has also been called as full of darkness.
The scientists say that the dark matter itself is the basis
of the universe. There is 90% darkness 10% light.
Let’s see where the centre of the 5th element is to be
found within the body. The electric bulb gives light only after


48 Sahib Bandgi

receiving power from some place. All the five materials have
their respective centres. The element earth is to be found at
the Pelvic plexus, the element water is at the region of Penis,
the element ‘air’ is present at the navel region. It is not the
case of Ravan but anyone else would also die if his navel
gets pierced. The centre of the element ‘fire’ is present in
the mouth whereas the centre of the element ‘sky’ is present
within the Sushuman.
The Munn remains hidden at this very place so that it
may remain invisible.
Shunya Mahal Mein Ghor Andhera, Karo Naam Ujiara.
There is pitch dark within Sushuman. The light can
appear there only with the power of Naam.
Sushuman Madhye Basey Niranjan, Moondha Dasvan Dwara.
Us Ke Ooper Makar Tar Hai, Chado Samhar Samhara.
Niranjan has his abode within Sushuman. He has closed
the 10th dwara. Above it lies the Makar taar (wire of Surti).
There is need to be cautious while moving over it.
Munn Cheehne Koyi Birla Bhedi.
Only some rare assayer can sight this Mind.
Munn Hi Niranjan Sabai Nachaye.
Mind itself is Niranjan who has been making all dance
to his tune.
From the dark region within the Sushuman, it passes on
orders to the brain. Our brain is not all in all. It is, so to say,
the minister of Niranjan.
Every organ of our body is obeying the dictates of Mind
through Brain. If the intellect asks us to salute some person,
the hands will automatically get folded. If the intellect directs
us to slap that person, those very hands would do so. It is
these very hands that were saluting on one occasion and slapps
on the other occasion. The hands had no knowledge of what
was going to happen. It was the power of the brain that made


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 49

them act as per its dictates. Our brain obeys the dictates
of Mind and not that of the Soul. Man has been living a
life taking itself as the brain and the body. None bothers to
know what lies beyond it.
Kahain Kabir Kise Samjhaon, Sub Jug Andha.
Ik Dui Hove Unhein Samjhaon,
Subhi Bhulana Paitva Ka Dhanda.
Sahib Kabir says whom he should admonish. Whole of
the world seems to be blind. Had there been one or two, he
would have tried to admonish but here everyone seems to
be engrossed in caring for his bodily needs alone.
However, he is forced to say—
Ek Na Bhoola Do Na Bhoole, Jo Hai Sanatan Soyi Bhoola.
Not one or two but everyone here seems to have forgotten
his real identity.
Santo Yeh Jug Baurana.
O saints! the worldly people seem to be mad.
This Mind continues to send its waves to the brain. The
brain can’t understand this secret. Had the brain been able
to understand it, the existence of the world would have
vanished. This is the great secret behind all this. The mobile
receives the waves. Wherefrom does it receive these? They
come from the tower but none is in a position to see these.
The mobile only acts as a medium. Niranjan has created the
body for the fulfilment of its own activities.
Dev Niranjan Sakal Sharira.
Ta Mein Bhram Bhram Rahat Kabira.
The Soul Within The Body Has Been Misled By Niranjan.
Yeh Tann Vish Ki Belri, Guru Amrit Ki Khani.
Sheesh Diya Jo Guru Miley, To Bhi Sasta Jann.
This body is like a heap of poison whereas the guru is a
store-house of nectar.


50 Sahib Bandgi

It is a very cheap bargain for a devotee to have the shelter
of a guru even at the cost of crushing his ego.
All our outward activities are performed at the instance
of the Mind.
Chashme Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashe Ho Rahey.
Dil Satan Kya Kya Hain Tere Dil Satane Ke Liye.
Try to see with the inner eyes the plays that are being
enacted within. All these plays are meant for torturing you
in one way or the other.
Ek Dil Lakhon Tamanna, Us Pai Bhi Jyada Havas.
Phir Thikana Hai Kahan, Usko Bithane Ke Liye.
If you have lakhs of desires in your heart and still want
to have more and more, then there will be no room left
for seating Param Purush there.
Our Soul obeys the dictates of Munn. If the brain directs
you to go to Srinagar, you begin to prepare for the same.
The memory and eyes also seem to contribute in this
regard. Just as a juggler makes the monkey dance to his tune,
the Munn also makes the Soul do so. There must be some
reason behind the attempt of Munn to keep the Soul
wandering. Self interest of the Munn is the only reason for
it. What is Munn? Wherefrom has it emerged? Why has it
kept us in an awkward position? What is the source of its
power? It exercises its influence on all. He is the 5th son of
Param Purush. Dharam Dass ji, in order to know about the
creation of the universe, prayed to Sahib Kabir thus — “O
Sahib! kindly tell me the whereabouts of Amarlok. Where
do the jivas live there? How were the 3 lokas created? How
was Kaal Purush created? How were the 16 sons created?
How did this flawless Soul get entangled in the four modes
of creation? How did the Souls get entangled in the grip of
Kaal Purush? How were the Tridevas created?


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 51

How were the earth and the sky created? How was the
physical body created? Pray explain to me in detail the creation
of the entire universe.” Taking Dharam Dass as the deserving
disciple, Sahib Kabir said—
Tab Ki Baat Sunhu Dharam Dassa.
Jab Nahin Mahi Patal Akasha.
Jab Nahin Kooram Brah Aur Shesha.
Jab Nahin Sharad Gauri Ganesha.
Jab Nahin Hatey Niranjan Raya.
Jin Jeevan Kah Bandhiya Jhulaya.
Brahma Vishno Mahesh Na Tahiya.
Shastra Ved Puran Na Kahya.
Tab Sab Rahey Purush Ko Mahin.
Jyun Batt Briksh Madhya Rahey Chhahin.
O Dharam Dass! I am talking of the time when there
was no existence of the earth, the sky, Kooram, Shesh, Barah,
Sharad, Gauri, Ganesh and the like. Also, there was no
existence of Niranjan, the torturer of the jivas and the 33
crore gods even.
Moreover, even Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, the Vedas, the
shastras, the Puranas etc. had no existence. But there was
the One. He was all alone.
In the beginning, Satya Purush was hidden from sight.
He had no companion. Neither He has ever been created nor
will he ever perish.
That which is created, has to perish. However, as Param
Purush has never been created, there is no question of his
perishing away. Sahib Kabir tells Dharam Dass that Sagun,
Nirgun, big as well as small lokas and the like were created
afterwards. As such, there is none whom he can ask to bear
witness. Even the 4 Vedas have no information about Satya
Purush. They talk upto the limit of Niranjan alone.


52 Sahib Bandgi

Regarding the creation of the earth, sky, Brahmand,
Niranjan, Tridev and the like, Sahib Kabir says that first of
all Param Purush desired and uttered a sound. It created a
rare white and dazzling light that spread in the infinite. Unlike
the worldly light, that light was so rare that even a particle
of it could put to insignificance the light of even crores of
suns. When that light spread in the infinite, Param Purush
Himself got absorbed in it. As a result, that light became
awakened and alive. It is just like the case of a body that
becomes awakened with the entrance of the Soul in it. It was
only after coming into the light that Param Purush came to
be called as Satya Purush and the rare light that was nothing
but Param Purush Himself, came to be called as Amarlok.
Still, Satya Purush was all alone. Then He desired and
jerked away that light from His ownself. Infinite number of
droplets were produced. These returned back to that rare light.
These were just like the water drops that scatter when one
throws up a handful of water (say from a sea). However,
unlike the droplets of water that return back to the sea and
become a part of it, those droplets of light, though returned
back to light, yet they didn’t become a part of it. This is
because satya Purush desired that these should maintain their
separate identity. These very droplets were called as Souls.
All of these began to move about in that light in a manner a
fish moves about in water. Param Purush was much pleased
to see all this. He began to love those Souls. Much time passed
thus. The Souls were deriving much pleasures there.
Sada Anand Hoth Hai Va Ghar, Kabhu Na Hoth Udasa.
There are bliss and bliss alone to be found there. No
sort of sufferings and sorrows are to be seen there.
There the light of a Soul is equivalent to that of 16 suns
whereas the light emanating from even a single pore of Param
Purush can put to insignificance the light of even crores of


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 53

suns and moons. When even a single pore of Param Purush
has such a glory, what can be said about Param Purush
Himself. None can even imagine it.
Then Param Purush created sons simply by uttering
words. That is to say, all the words spoken by Him were
taking the form of sons. The second word spoken by Him
created Kooram. The third word created Geyan whereas the
4th one created Vivek. Every word spoken by Him was taking
the form of a son. He thought of creating one like His ownself.
In order to do so, He uttered a word in a forceful manner.
He did so in a somewhat in doubt. Then He entered within
the body of this 5th son in order to know whether it resembled
Him in all respects or not. For a moment He thought that it
was not His body. As such, He came out of it and entered
into His own body. This fifth son, Niranjan (Munn) was
created when the word was uttered in a doubtful manner.
Other words uttered by Him created Sahaj, Santosh, Chetna,
Anand, Kshyama, Nishkam, Jalrangi, Achint, Prem, Deen
Dayal and Dhairya. He created the sons simply to enhance
the glory of Amarlok. All of them began to move about in
Amarlok. All the sons were created as per the desire of Param
Purush but the Souls are a part of Him. Sahib Kabir has
beautifully described this situation.
Jeevra Ansh Purush Ka Ahi. Adi Antt Koyi Janat Nahin.
The Jiva is a part of Param Purush whose beginnings
and end are unknown to mankind.
The Soul has not been created like other sons. It is very
much a part of Param Purush. That is why it has in it all the
virtues of the latter. When the children display the virtues
of their parents, it is but natural for the Soul to have all the
traits of Param Purush. You are not an ordinary being. You
are, so to say, the children of a great emperor. The light of a
Soul is equivalent to that of 16 suns. The sparks are produced


54 Sahib Bandgi

when we light the fire. There is some difference between a
spark and the fire. There is difference between a sea and a
drop. One can get drowned in a sea but certainly not in a
drop. The Soul has a light equivalent to that of 16 suns. It
means, its source of light is as vast as the sea.
Sub Ki Gathri Lal Hai, Koyi Nahin Kangal.
Everyone of us has pearls with him , none penniless.
The knowledge you receive is also due to the waves.
These come in a subtle manner. The Hansas (Souls) were
enjoying the rare kind of bliss in Amarlok. Afterwards,
Niranjan, the 5th son of Param Purush, began to meditate.
Param Purush was pleased with his worship and asked him
the reason thereof. Niranjan prayed to Him to give him some
separate abode. Param Purush gave him Mansrovar (a
continent of Amarlok). Niranjan was much pleased to have
this abode. Soon after, once again, he began to meditate on
Him. He did so again for a period of 70 yugas. Param Purush
asked him the reason of worshipping again.
Itna Thanv Na Mohi Suhayi.
Ab Mohi Baksi Deh-Hu Thakurayi.
Kai Mohi Dehu Lok Adhikara.
Kai Mohi Dehu Desh Ik Nyara.
Niranjan said that he was not pleased with that much.
He prayed to Him to either give him the whole of Amarlok
or to give him some rare Loka where he could have his full
sway without any kind of interference.
At this, Param Purush told him that his elder brother, Kooram
had a seed of 5 elements (in subtle form) with him and that he
could request him to give that to him (Niranjan). With that seed
he could create 3 lokas in shunya. He also blessed him to rule
there for a period of 17 Chaukri Asankhya yugas.
Niranjan went to Kooramji and instead of requesting
him to hand over to him the seed of 5 elements, he forcibly


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 55

took it out of his body in a manner one draws out the blood
from someone’s body. Kooram ji remained calm. He asked
Param Purush whom He had sent to him. The fellow had
forcibly taken the seed of 5 elements from him. Param Purush
told him that the fellow was his younger brother and asked
him to forgive him. However, Param Purush thought as to
what sort of Niranjan had been created.
With this seed Niranjan created five material elements
(water, fire, air, earth and sky). Just as a potter makes different
articles with clay, he used these 5 elements to create 49 crore
yojan land, sun, moon, stars, seven patals and seven lokas
etc. Crores of years thus passed. He remained in this shunya
for a long time. However, without the jivas this universe was
lifeless.
Niranjan was not satisfied with such a kind of universe.
Once again, he meditated on Param Purush for a period of
64 yugas. The latter asked him what more he wanted.
Dee Jai Kheit Beej Nij Sara.
Niranjan prayed to Param Purush to give him some jivas
to rule over.
Then Param Purush desired and created a girl (Adhya
Shakti) with 8 arms. Offering salutations to Param Purush,
she asked why she had been created. Handing over infinite
number of Souls to her, Param Purush said, “O daughter!
Niranjan has created 3 lokas in Shunya. You should go with
these Souls to him and create a real and true universe along
with him.” Param Purush had not asked them to put the Souls
in physical bodies. He had, instead, asked them to create a
true universe on the pattern of Amarlok.
As per the dictates of Param Purush, Adhya Shakti went
to Mansrovar. Niranjan was charmed by her beauty.
Aavat Kamini Dekhyo Jabhi.
Dharam Rai Munn Hershyo Tabhi.


56 Sahib Bandgi

Kla Anant Antt Kachhu Nahin.
Kaal Magan Havai Nirkhat Tahin.
Nirkhat Dharam Su Bhayo Adhira.
Ung Ung Sub Nirakh Sharira.
Dharam Rai Kanya Kah Grasa.
Kaal Savhav Suno Dharam Dassa.
Niranjan was very much pleased on seeing Adhya Shakti.
She was a perfect model with multiple traits of a woman. Lustful
thoughts surfaced in his mind. Catching her head with one hand
and the feet with the other, he swallowed her. It is after this
incident that he was called as Kaal Purush or Kaal Niranjan.
Keeno Gras Kaal Anyai. Tabb Kanya Chit Vishmat Layi.
Tatchhan Kanya Keenha Pukara. Kaal Niranjan Keenha Ahara.
As soon as Niranjan swallowed her, she called out to
Param Purush saying Kaal Niranjan had swallowed her.
Tabhi Dharam Sahaj Lug Ayi.
Sahaj Shunya Tabb Leenha Chhudayi.
Then Niranjan went to Sahaj and made him flee from
there. The hard worship had given him much power.
Purush Dhyan Kooram Anusara.
Mosan Kaal Keenha Adhikara.
Teen Sheesh Mum Bhachhan Keenho.
Ho Satya Purush Daya Bhall Cheenho.
Yahi Chariter Purush Bhall Jani.
Deenho Shap So Kahon Bakhani.
Lachh Jeev Nit Grasau Kerhoo.
Swa Lachh Nit Prati Bisterhu.
Earlier as well he had forcibly taken the seed of 5
elements by tearing the belly of Kooram and now he had
swallowed Adhya Shakti. Param Purush took ill of all this
and hurled a curse on him saying he would consume one
lakh jivas daily but still his hunger would remain unsatisfied.
Moreover, he would create 1¼ lakh jivas daily.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 57

Puni Keenha Purush Tivan, Tihi Chhan Meti Daro Kaal Ho.
Kathin Kaal Kral Jeevan, Bahut Kareyi Bihal Ho.
Vachan Karo Pratipal, Desh Mor Abb Na Lahain.
As eliminating Niranjan would break His word, He hurled
a curse on him saying he won’t be able to visit His abode
and have His vision.
Jogjeet Kahan Tab Hi Bulava.
Dharam Charit Sub Kahi Samujhaya.
Jogjeet Tum Begi Didharo.
Dharam Raye Ko Mari Nikaro.
Param Purush then called yogjeet (Sahib Kabir). In fact,
Param Purush Himself was Yogjeet. This is because He had
produced Yogjeet by churning His ownself. He asked him
to turn Niranjan out of Mansrovar.
Mansrovar Rahan Na Pavai.
Ab Yeh Des Kaal Nahin Aavai.
Dharam Ke Udar Mahin Hai Nari.
Taso Kaho Nij Shabad Samhari.
Udar Phari Ke Bahar Aavai.
Kooram Udar Vidar Phall Pavai.
He would not come to His abode now. He has swallowed
Adhya Shakti. Tell her to meditate on Him and come out of
his body after tearing it away. This way, he would reap the
reward of his Karmas.
Dharam Rai Saun Kaho Vilayi,
Vahai Nari Abb Tumhari Hoyi.
Ja Kar Raho Dharam Vahi Desha.
Swarag Mritu Patal Naresha.
Tell Niranjan that he could now keep Adhya Shakti with
him. Also tell him to live as an emperor of the Swarga lok,
Mrityu lok (this universe) and Patal lok that have been created
by him.


58 Sahib Bandgi

Yogjeet Chal Bhe Sir Nayi. Mansrovar Pahunche Jayi.
Yogjeet Ko Dekha Jabb Hin. Ati Bho Kaal Bhayankar Tabb Hi.
Poochha Kaal Kaun Tum Aahu. Kaun Kaaj Tum Yahan Sidhahu.
Offering salutations to Param Purush, Yogjeet went to
mansrovar. On seeing him, Niranjan became furious and asked
who he was and what for he had come there.
Yogjeet Us Kahey Pukari.
Aho Dharam Tum Grasehu Nari.
Agya Purush Deenha Ko Kehya.
Nari Kahey Udar Mahan Rahya.
Udar Phari Abb Aavhu Bahar.
Purush Tej Sumiro Tohi Thahar.
Yogjeet told Dharam Rai (Niranjan) that he had
swallowed the girl and that he (Yogjeet) had come there as
per the dictates of Param Purush to turn him (Niranjan) out
of that place. Then he asked the girl why she was lying in
his body. She should tear off his belly and come out.
Sunike Dharam Krodh Ur Jareu.
Yogjeet So Sunmukh Bhireu.
Yogjeet Tabb Keenha Dheyana.
Purush Pratap Tej Ur Aana.
Purush Agya Bheyi Tehi Kala.
Marhu Surti Lilar Krala.
Yogjeet Puni Taiso Keenha.
Jus Agya Purush Tehi Deenha.
Niranjan was infuriated on hearing all this and stood in
front of Yogjeet to have a fight with him. The latter meditated
on Param Purush and taking His glamour, threw his Surti
on Niranjan. As a result, Niranjan became unconscious and
fell down.
Gahi Bhuja Phatkar Deenhon, Pareu Lok Se Nyar Ho.
Then Yogjeet caught hold of his arm and threw him down
the Amarlok into Shunya.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 59

Then Adhya Shakti also came out of his body. She felt
afraid. Nevertheless, Niranjan persuaded her to stay with him
and co-operate with him in the task of misleading the Souls.
The Munn is unstable. It derives pleasures through the
body. That is why it continues to torture the Souls.
Vo Gupat Bhaye Puni Sung Sub Ke,
Munn Niranjan Janiye.
Niranjan, in the guise of Mind, has been residing within
all the bodies.
It is not easy to sight him. He resides in Shunya where
there is darkness alone. A thief has love for darkness because
it is difficult to recognise him at this time. If he tries to escape
with the stolen articles in sunlight, there is every chance of
his being caught. That is why Sushumna is the capital of
Munn. It performs all its activities from here. Ignorance alone
is the Soul of the universe.
Munn Hi Saroopi Dev Niranjan, Tohi Raha Bharmai.
He Hansa Tu Amarlok Ka, Pada Kaal Bus Ayi.
Munn itself is Niranjan who has been misleading you.
O Hansa! your abode is in Amarlok but you have fallen
in the grip of Kaal.
Had there been no ignorance, the Soul wouldn’t have
attained such a dirty body. The Soul is flawless. Even inspite
of knowing this, everyone is living a dirty life. The Soul is
a pure awareness state. It is Surti itself. It has got entangled
in the body.
There is shunya in empty glass. There is shunya in an
empty pitcher as well. However, where does this shunya go
when the pitcher is broken? It appeared within the pitcher.
It was within the pitcher as well as outside. Likewise, the
Soul is within the body as well as in the outer place. It remains
at all the times at its own point. It is the body that makes its
presence felt inside. It is in the form of Surti. It is this very


60 Sahib Bandgi

Surti that has been misled by the Munn. It doesn’t spare the
Surti for a moment even. This is because it is afraid that it
will move near its ownself if it is allowed to remain free. It
continues to keep it entangled in the body related activities.
It is just like the case of a mother who, in order to engage
herself in her own work, keeps the child busy with some
toys.
Jadd Chetan Hai Granthi Padd Gayi.
Yadyapi Mithya Chhootat Kathinayi.
The gross body and the awakened Soul seem to have
developed a knot. Though it is an unreal one, yet it is not
easy to untie it.
It is the Soul itself that has developed this knot. Otherwise,
there is no power that can keep it in its grip. It is the Soul
that supplies the needed energy to the body. Breath is the
energy for the body and it is the Soul that is taking in the
breath. If the Soul stops doing so, the whole play will come
to an end.
The Soul has taken itself as the body. It has associated
itself with all the pleasures and pains related to this body. It
has been carrying on the breathing activity from behind the
Medula plexus. Due to the influence of Munn Maya it has
lost its Vivek-power of spiritual analysis and seems to have
gone in a deep sleep. The guru brings you to your senses.
None but a Satguru can do so. He gives you such vision,
not found in the universe.
Coming to senses is nothing but your getting awakened.
Without these inner eyes, none can sight anything. Your
intellect becomes sharp. All this is the result of your being
awakened.

#### 8. Technique to turn into rare ones

Saat Surti Ka Sakal Pasara.
Surti Se Kachu Nahin Nyara.
The whole manifestation is that of the seven Surtis.
There is nothing to be found beyond the limit of Surti.
The Surti is Soul itself. Sahib Kabir has spoken a lot
about Surti. Sometimes, the devotees sit in meditation and
think they would soon be able to have a vision of light or
would be able to soar high. I advise you not to pay heed to
such things during meditation. Just as in this physical body
made of the 5 material elements there are Karamendriyas,
Geyanendriyas, bones, flesh, skin and pores etc., in the same
manner, our Surti has in it a universe of its own kind.
Sahib Kabir, while speaking about the universe of this
Surti, has said—
Surti Ka Khel Sara Hai.
The whole play is that of Surti- concentration.
Our Surti has eyes, feet and hands etc. in it.
This physical body is made of the 5 perishable elements
(water, fire, air, earth and sky) but the Surti related to body
is made of 5 permanent elements. (truth, vivek, peace, pity
and patience). The hands to be found in our Surti are not
like the ones to be found in our body. Those are of a rare
kind. The eyes and feet as well are of a rare kind. Unlike
the physical mouth that has 32 perishable teeth in it, the mouth
related to Surti is also of a permanent nature. There is an
instance to cite in this regard.
Shivli had been awarded death punishment at the hands
of the ruling class. The king ordered the executioners to cut
off his legs. Shivli said that he was in possession of the legs
that could take him to God. Then the king ordered for
removing his eyes. Shivli said that unlike those physical eyes,

```
61
```

62 Sahib Bandgi
he possessed such eyes as could see the inner world as well as
God. Then the king ordered the executioners to cut off his
hands as well. Shivli said they could do so. He possessed such
hands as could reach the durbar of God.
Then the king ordered for removing his tongue. Shivli
asked the executioners to wait for a while. Thanking God
he said that he never hoped to pass such a severe test.
All this clearly shows that our Surti has rare kinds of hands,
feet and eyes in it. Goswami ji has also confirmed this view.
Pug Binu Chaley Suney Bin Kana.
Kar Binu Karam Karey Vidhi Nana.
Aanan Rahit Sakal Rus Bhogi,
Bin Vani Vakti Badd Yogi.
Tann Binu Paras Nain Binu Darsey,
Gahey Gyan Sub Sheikh Vishekhe.
Yeh Vidhi Sabai Alokik Karni,
Mahima Jaye Kavan Vidhi Barni.
That subtle body sees without eyes, walks without feet
and smells without nose. Everything of a rare kind is to
be found in it.
The sayings of the enlightened Souls confirm this view.
Guru Nanak Dev ji says—
Akhhen Bajo Pekhna, Bin Kanne Sun-Na.
Hatthon Bajo Karna, Bin Paire Chalna.
Nanak Hukam Pachhan Ke, Yun Jeevat Marna.
This subtle body needs no eyes to see, no ears to listen,
no hands to work and no feet to walk.
Sahib Kabir says—
Pair Bin Chall Gayo, Shahar Begum Pura.
Without feet this Surti reached the place where no kind
of sorrows are to be found.
Tahan Bain Bin Bolna, Nain Bin Boojhna.
Aap Ka Khel Kaha Kaun Janey.
Acts of speaking is done even without any words and
act of sighting is done even without the eyes.
All this clearly indicates that this Surti of ours
possesses vast potentialities in it.

#### 9. What harm can Kaal do to him?

The individual Soul (Jevi) has to deal with a very shrewd
power that doesn’t let it know of its real identity. This power
(Mind) is fully aware of the fact that it will fail to keep jiva
in its grip if the latter realises its ownself. Mind’s interest is
safe only if the jiva takes itself as a body made of the five
material elements and performs all the activities are for
fulfilling its endless desires. For such a thing to happen, the
Mind uses all possible ways to mislead the Soul.
There was a sage. He was a great philosopher as well.
Once he announced that he would teach anyone who desired,
the skill of using a sword. Many persons reached for the
purpose. The sage interviewed those who came and selected
a few.
After a few days, he selected one of them and said that
he would teach him. He told him to stay with him for some
days in the Ashram before the actual training programme.
The boy agreed to it. One day, while he was engaged in some
service, the sage, all of a sudden, attacked him with a stick.
The boy was startled. He looked back and found the sage
standing. The sage had attacked him with a wooden sword.
The sage told him that his training programme had started
right from that day. He asked him to remain alert saying he
could be attacked with a sword at any time. The boy began
to remain alert. On one or two occasions, the sage attacked
him with a sword but the boy saved himself because of his
alertness. After some days, the sage told him that until now
he had been attacking him with a wooden sword but
henceforth he could attack him with a real sword. The boy

```
63
```

64 Sahib Bandgi

became more alert. The sage used to attack in a forceful manner.
The sage made a few attempts to attack the boy with a real
sword but the boy saved himself. Then the sage told him that
until now he was attacking him in his awakened state but now
onward he could attack him even during his sleep. As such, he
should remain more alert. The boy thought the attack during the
awakened state was not so dangerous but during the sleep it could
prove dangerous. He became ever more alert. Suddenly, one day
the sage attacked him during his sleep. However, the boy saved
himself by jumping aside.
Now the question arises as to how did the boy succeed
in saving himself. You see the drivers plying their vehicles.
They nap even while driving. Much alertness is needed in
the act of driving. The driver looks far ahead. When he finds
the road clear, he naps for a while.
Sometimes, this napping can last long. That is to say,
this act of sleeping is an intentional one.
There was a time when I had no driver with me. I myself
drove the vehicle for about 6 months. One day, I drove the
vehicle from Badi Brahmna to Raya Morh in a sleeping state.
At Raya Morh, I received a signal to have a turn. Then I
received the signal to avoid having a nap while driving. I
take much work from my body. Sometimes, my waist seems
to ask me to have some rest but I direct it to remain straight.
Sometimes, my eyes seem to be tired but I don’t stop my
job. I take my mind as my greatest servant. It does what
I want. It has to dance to my tunes.
Why does the mind seem so much desirous of preventing
the Soul from having awareness of its real identity? This is
because it knows that its whole play will come to an end
the moment the Soul comes to know of its real identity.
Vashishath muni had told Ramji that a jiva could cross


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 65

the worldly ocean after having Soul realisation. Ramji asked
him what quality of the Soul enabled one to cross the worldly
ocean. Vashishathji said that one could understand the reality
of the world after having Soul realisation. The jiva then begins
to realise that nothing in the world is of any use to him and
no article of any kind can reach it. Just as the fear of rope
remains no more when the misconception of its being a snake
is removed, in the same manner, the misconception regarding
the universe remains no more when one attains Soul
realisation. After this, one stops taking the universe as true.
That is why the Munn remains alert to see to it that the Soul
doesn’t succeed in realising awareness of its ownself.
A man from Germany has 16 children. He didn’t have a
sleep for 36 years. When asked, the fellow said that he was
in army. Once they caught some militants. They were being
brought from the jungle. While on their way, they were asked
to march to some other place. He was left there to watch over
those militants while his colleagues left for the other place.
The militants were dangerous fellows. He thought that they
would kill him if he sleep. So he became alert. The other soldiers
didn’t return for 3 days. He couldn’t sleep for 3 days and 3
nights. After this incident the tissues responsible for bringing
sleep got damaged and he couldn’t get sleep thereafter.
If you remain alert like this, the Mind will do no harm
to you. It is the nature of Mind to remain engaged in one or
the other job. It tries to invent ever new techniques to mislead
you. So in order to escape from the tricks of Mind, you will
have to remain alert for all the 24 hours.
Uska Kaal Kya Karey Jo Aath Pahar Hoshiyar.
Kaal can do no harm to one who is alert for all the 24
hours.

## 10. 70 dissolutions On the Path

#### Path

Spiritual journey is a very important issue. It is essential
as well. At present, there are many panths in the universe.
Many discussions are being made on the topic of spiritualism.
Nevertheless, there are fewer discussions regarding the true
and real spiritualism. I am saddened to see that the religious
field is taking a wrong direction. At some places the yoga
related programmes are organised. The participants are made
to offer donations. The enlightened Souls always think about
the well-being of the people. That is to say, the religious
field is being polluted. Real spiritualism is completely
different from materialistic approach. What kind of
appearance does the Soul have? Which is the power that
is running the body? The awareness about these things is
called as spiritualism. Telling some stories etc. has nothing
to do with spiritualism. At present, spiritualism has got limited
to the telling of stories or other things from the Holy
Scriptures. What is the way to reach the world of spiritualism?
If at all someone performs noble deeds, how will he reach
heaven? Who will take him there? I ask many devotees
belonging to other panths (Path) the answer to such questions
but they fail to give any satisfactory answer. Let’s see how
we perform the spiritual journey. The Soul of ours is
extraordinary entity. How does it visit different lokas
(abodes)? Can the proof regarding the same be given? Yes,
the proof can be given in support of it. Every vehicle has
gears in it. To start it, the first gear has to be applied. While
ascending some road, the 2nd gear has to be applied. The
fifth gear has to be applied while accelerating the speed.

Similarly there are many techniques in our body.
Sur Durlabh Manav Tann Paya.
Shruti Puvan Sab Granthan Gaya.
All the Puranas and the holy scriptures have described
the attaining of human body as very rare.
The holy scriptures of Muslims also say that God made
man like His own self. That is to say, this body has certain
specialties in it. Let us see what kind of subtle bodies are
there in this physical body.
Our physical body functions in the awakened state only.
In the sleep state it becomes inactive. A sleeping person is
like a dead. In that state we see dreams. A sleeping man can
neither see with eyes nor can hear with ears nor can smell
with nose. We work with this gross body when we reach the
awakened state. Then all the 14 Indriyas-senses become
active. The awakened state controls their activities. In this
state our Surti-concentration has its place in the eyes. We
can see the material world in this state. So to say, a sort of
curtain falls on the eyes of a sleeping man. Everyone of us
is passing through these different states. These can’t help us
in attaining spiritual vision. In the dream man attains another
body that performs a lot of works. This body is a very subtle
one. Man spends about 1/3 (one third) of his life in sleep.
In dream state, man even soars high and reaches many places.
This body is as small as a thumb. Man is not aware of it.
Just as a drunkard also performs some works but he can’t
perform these to the extent he can when not intoxication, in
the same manner, the power to work in the dream state
becomes 16 times less than that in the awakened state. Man
often finds it hard to run in a proper manner even. You make
a definite planning when you go to sleep and after getting
awake, you make a fresh beginning continuing with your
previous planning.
So to say, during sleep we move out of the awakened


68 Sahib Bandgi

state whereas on getting awake we, once again, return to the
awakened state and start our activities with the Indriyas of
our gross body. This is really a great thing to know how you
entered into this small subtle body and how you managed
to come out of it. Some meditated and succeeded in gaining
control over their sleep. They could see how they entered
into another subtle body and how they managed to come out
of it. That is to say, there are many similarities in our activities
performed through both — the subtle as well as the gross
body. Why do we enter in the awakened state after passing
through the dream state? This is because the tissues/cells
responsible for taking us into the world of dreams become
tired and go to sleep. During the daytime it is the gross tissues
that get tired of work and once again the tissues responsible
for taking us to the world of dreams became active and we
go to sleep. It means, we can’t remain in two states at one
and the same time. We can experience only one state at a
time. The gaining of control over these two is called as
gaining a victory over sleep.
Sometimes, during our dream state we reach such places
as we can’t even imagine. The related cells make us realise
that that very state is a real one. It is only man who can move
into these states.
The 3rd one is called as the Sushupati-deep sleep state.
This is the state of great ignorance. In this state, the Surti-
concentration reaches in the navel region. The awareness
grows dull. We move out of both — the dream as well as
the awakened state.
We see no dreams. We can’t even know how the night
passed. On getting awake, we feel astonished as to where
we have reached. It takes sometime to recognise our bearings.
Some devotees reach this state through the medium of
Indriyas. Many a times we experience all this in our life.
Nevertheless, all these states are related to Maya. These are


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 69

misleading Soul.
Yun Sapna Pekhna, Jag Rachna Tim Jaan.
Is Mein Kachhu Sancho Nahin, Nanak Sanchi Maan.
Nanak Dev ji says that the creation of the universe is
dream like. There is no element of truth seen in all this.
In all these states the Mind remains active. The memory
also works well. If we happen to meet our relations, we talk
about it. However, the Sushupati state is equivalent to that
of unconsciousness and death. In all these three states the
gross organs function at a slow pace. The fourth state is that
of Turiya. In this state, the concentration of man reaches
Sushumna Nadi. It won’t happen on its own. One has to
concentrate the awareness of whole of the body at one point.
The yogis do so. They mix up the airs present in the body
and reach the Medula plexus. Here the gross body doesn’t
perform any function. The devotee experiences a thousand
times more power in him. He acquires knowledge of the past,
present and the future. The body the yogis attain in this state
is called as Mahakaran body. Karan Sharir is related to
concentration. This is a very subtle state. You seem to be
lost somewhere and others ask you where you have gone.
You reach where you fix your concentration. You are startled.
Sometimes, you remember someone and soon after you
find that person standing before you. In fact, that person had
appeared before you through his Karan Sharir. That is why
you remembered him. However, in Turiya state it is the Maha
Karan Sharir that a devotee attains. It is a very unique state
of the body. It is also called as the opening of the inner eyes.
In this state a devotee gets the eyes to see even far off places.
It happens due to Kaam yog. It is just a sort of lighting of
1000 watt bulb in a dark room. Water is a compound of 2
gases. The scientists can produce fire by mixing two gases.
The yogi pierces the Shatt chakra and reaches Sushumna.
He becomes so much knowledgeable that he begins to


70 Sahib Bandgi

consider others as fools. He attains many miraculous powers
as well. Such powers often make the yogis egotists.
In this state a devotee attains the Geyan Dehi (knowledge
related body). He becomes carefree. It can help him in
observing the inner world.
Vigyan Dehi (scientific body) in this state the Mind has
its existence, though it is in a very subtle form. The Maha
yogeshwars reach this state. Here the devotee moves beyond
the limit of Munn and intellect. He can reach where he casts
a look. Mohd. Sahib had visited the seven skies. A bowl of
water was about to fall. In the meantime, he returned from
his journey and stopped the bowl from falling. This body
looks without the eyes, hears without the ears, smells without
the nose and works without hands. This body has a unique
nature.
The bird is in the cage. It has the power to fly. However,
it can fly only within the space available to it. Likewise, the
Soul is in the grip of Mind, it has the limited choice to move
about.
A lion can jump 27 feet but if it is imprisoned in a cage,
it can jump within that limit only. In the bodily cage the power
of the Soul has decreased to a great extent.
In the Turiyateet state a devotee can live as long as he
desires. Shivji can sit in meditation for a period of 4 yugas.
Often you hear that some particular sage lived a life for so
many years. How can it be possible? If you make less use
of your battery, you can use it for a longer time. And if you
make more use of it, it will run for a short time only.
Likewise, the Maha yogeshwars spend more time in that
state and as a result, they live long.
How do we understand what others say. Our ears catch
those words and tissues related to memory tell us about these.
There is the spiritual element behind our power of
understanding, Soul also plays its part. However, the Soul


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 71

is not in a position to use its full force. It is working through
the medium of body alone.
During fever the temperature of the body increases. The
taste of tongue is also affected. The whole system of the body
seems to be disturbed. There is loss of appetite as well but
the health doesn’t die out. It is the fever that has dominated it
for the time being. Likewise, the Mind has dominated the Soul.
Now it is the Munn that is making its presence felt. A diseased
person desires to regain health. This is because the fever has
spoiled the charm and pleasures of his life. In the same manner,
the fever of Mind gets removed in that state of Turiyateet and
the devotee begins to enjoy the real pleasures. We have to
make our movements through the medium of body whereas
the Soul has the power to move even without feet. That is
why the body has reduced the power of the Soul.
Akhhon Bajon Pekhna, Bin Kanne Sun-Na.
Hathe Bajon Karna, Bin Pairon Chalna.
Nanak Hukam Pachhan Ke, Yun Jeevat Marna.
Nanak Dev ji says—
Seeing without eyes, hearing without ears, working
without hands and walking without feet is just like dying
while living.
In the Gita, Vasdev Krishan tells Arjun that the Soul has
the power to see in all the directions even though it has no
eyes. The light in a roon comes through a some hole. But
the amount of light entering into the room depends on the
openings. In the same manner, the Soul being imprisoned in
the bodily cage is not in a position to make free itself.
Krishanji further told Arjun that inspite of having no feet,
it could walk in all the directions and even inspite of having
no mouth, it could speak in all the directions. That language
is, indeed, a very rare one.
Ek Hans Ke Munn Jo Aayi.
Doosar Hans Samajh Puni Jayi.


72 Sahib Bandgi

Every Hans can perceive what the other Hans conveys.
The Maya has entangled us in such a way that our power
of performing jobs has declined considerably. It seems as if
we have compromised with our set up. We have put all our
might in the material world. Sahib Kabir says that a devotee
should concentrate all his scattered power to realise his real
power. There is need to remove the outer covering if we want
to have a knowledge of our real self. After throwing light
on the six subtle inner bodies, Sahib Kabir says—
Is Ke Aage Bheid Hamara. Janeyga Koyi Janan Hara.
Kahain Kabir Janey Ga Vohi, Ja Par Kripa Satguru Ki Hoi.
Only some rare individual who has with him the grace
of a Satguru can know the secret related to him.
It is not possible to reach Amarlok through these subtle
bodies. This is because even those bodies are perishable. None
of the earlier sages could go beyond this limit. Spiritual journey
can be performed in 3 ways — Meen, Papeel and Vihangam.
Meen means fish, Papeel means ant whereas Vihangam means
a bird. The ant crawls at a very slow pace whereas the fish
moves at a little faster pace. Those following the Meen Marg
(path) concentrate at Bunk Naal whereas those following the
Papeel Marg concentrate at the Medula plexus. In Vihangam
Marg, a force takes the Soul out of the body on its own.
Sahib Kabir sasy—
70 Pralaya Marg Mahin, Kaise Jeev Lahey Deedara.
How can the jiva have a vision of Param Purush when
70 dissolutions lie in the path.
Bin Satguru Pavey Nahin, Koyi Kotin Karey Upaye.
One may adopt as many techniques as one likes but
He can’t be attained without seeking the shelter of a
Satguru.
Man can succeed in attaining any of the six subtle bodies.
The yogis, through the Maha Karan Sharir, can see many
heavenly abodes (lokas). Those who follow the Meen marg,


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 73

fix their concentration at the musical notes and listen to 70
kinds of musical sounds emanating from within. The devotee
listens to the music of his choice. Not only the musical
instruments are being played but the words are also being
produced. When a number of persons speak, you will listen
to only the fellow on whom you fix your concentration.
Likewise, the devotee can listen to the music at which he
concentrates. If you follow the sound of a train, you will
reach heaven; if you follow the sound of a conch, you will
reach the abodes like Brahm lok whereas the sound of a flute
can take you to lokas like Sohang. It is just like the case of
a fish that can move even in the direction opposite to that of
the flow of water.
Nevertheless, the saints have talked about that which is
entirely different from all this path. These musical notes can’t
help a devotee move out of the limit of Brahmand. Sighting
of light as well falls in the limit of Maya. Niranjan himself
has the light equivalent to that of one thousand suns.
I asked many devotees about Vihangam but none could
give any satisfactory answer. The Satguru himself takes the
disciple to Amarlok but how can a guru do so?
Surti Kamal Satguru Ko Vasa.
The Satguru is in possession of Paras Surti.
The yogis reach upto the 6th plexus whereas the
yogeshwars reach the 7th plexus. The saints have talked about
the 8th plexus. If you want to reach Tamil Nadu, you have
to board the train bound for that place. Trains bound for other
places can’t take you there. Likewise, the abode of Satguru
is in the 8th plexus. Guru Nanak Dev ji says—
Aath Attaki Atari Majara, Dekha Purush Nyara.
He sighted the rare purush in the 8th plexus.
The Tamil Nadu bound train can be boarded from
Delhi only and not from Ludhiana.

### 11. Spiritual Awareness

All of us have a desire to attain spiritual knowledge. The
power that has tied the Soul in chains is very clever and
shrewd. It has dominated it to such an extent that the Soul
has forgotten its real nature and virtues. Man, at the instance
of Mind, performs the acts of forgery, cheating, dishonesty
etc. Soul has nothing to do with all these. It has become
helpless to do anything on its own accord. If murder, cheating,
forgery etc. are the acts performed by the Soul, then Param
Purush, of whom Soul is a part, must be in possession of
these very vices. The holy scriptures sing in glory of Him
and take Him as flawless and pure. It clearly shows that the
Soul is made to do all sorts of wrong acts. As a result, it has
to leave one body only to enter into another one based on
the karmas performed by it through its association with the
Indriyas. It means, the Soul has been tied based on Karmas.
Let’s think over the Karmas that are being performed
by man. Some perform agricultural activities. They do so to
support their families. The Soul has nothing to do with these
activities, as it has no mouth to take food. It is beyond the
limit of Munn and Indriyas. Man performs two sorts of
Karmas—evil and noble. All these Karmas are related to the
fulfilment of bodily needs alone (Physical existence). Man
performs different jobs for constructing a good house for
shelter and for buying all the needed material objects that
can help him lead a peaceful and decent life. The severities
of the hot and cold weather can’t bother the Soul in any
manner. Therefore, it needs no house for itself. The body is
‘Maya’. It means, the Soul has been entangled in Maya and

```
74
```

Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 75

is obeying its dictates. The facilities in a house like that of a
toilet, kitchen, dining room, bedroom, store etc. are ment
for meeting the needs of the body. The Soul has no excretery
organs and so needs no toilet. It has no articles to keep safe
and so needs no store. It never sleeps and so needs no bedroom.
The same is true about other structures as well. The ignorance
on the part of Soul to take itself as a body and to take all the
material needs of the body as its own have spoiled the whole
show. Under this misconception it supplies all the needed energy
to the body. Had it not done so, the mayaic body would have
collapsed for want of energy. Sahib Kabir has beautifully
described this situation—
Deh Dharey Ka Dand Hai, Bhugtat Hai Sub Koyi.
Gyani Bhugtat Gyan Se, Moorakh Bhugtat Roye.
All those with physical bodies have to suffer from the
related sufferings while the enlightened ones deals wisely,
the fools do so weepingly.
Aakhir Yeh Tann Khak Mileyga.
Kahan Phirat Magruri Mein.
Why are you wandering like an egotist. This body is
bound to go into the vile dust.
When this is going to be the fate of this physical body,
what for does man do all sorts of wrong acts. The Soul has
taken this mayaic body as a reality. Though it sounds strange,
yet it is a fact that not only the ordinary people but even the
Rishi, Munies and the like are living as physical entities. As
a result, all of them continue to suffer in one way or the
other.
Kahain Kabir Kise Samjhaun, Sub Jug Andha.
Ik Dui Hovey Unhein Samjhaun,
Subhin Bhulana Paitva Ka Dhanda.
Sahib Kabir says that whole of the world has gone blind.
All are living for the sake of body. In such a case, there appears
to be none whom he should admonish.


76 Sahib Bandgi

There for none enjoy pleasures in this physical body.
Everyone will appear to envy others in matters related to
the material world but certainly not in matters related to the
spiritual world. I never envy anyone and as such, remain carefree.
I advise you to do the same as this feeling of envy will make
you small. In addition, it will rob you of your peace of mind
and will fill your interior with a sense of fear.
Anger is a great enemy of man. When a man is in a fit
of anger, the tissues of his brain produce toxins that reach
the heart and the belly. These damage the health. One should
escape from this enemy. It can land one in trouble. Under
the fit of anger, the people often come to blows after a brief
exchange of hot words. The tissues concerned with rational
thinking about the pros and cons of a situation, get disturbed.
It is just like the case of a man who feels disturbed in the
company of some quarrelsome fellow. You can watch your
appearance in a mirror whenever you fall in a fit of anger.
The face will seem to be disfigured. Two types of persons
keep away from anger. In the first type fall those who have
some Spiritual knowledge and in the other type fall those
who are mentally disturbed. A fellow who remains in a state
of anger, can’t hope to attain salvation.
There are some cells in our body that get awakened only
when we are in a state of happiness. Happiness pays a lot.
Some Naamis come to me with their small babies for giving
a name to their physical bodies. The children at first feel
afraid of me. Perhaps they do so on seeing my moustaches.
However, when I smile, they also smile and answer my
questions. The Soul has no trace of anger in it. It is a kind
of flaw in body alone.
The body is full of dirt and filth but the Soul is not so.
Every organ of our body produces one or the other kind of
filth. Our mouth, nostrils, eyes etc. continue to excrete one
or the other kind of filth. The foul smell emanating from the


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 77

dead body of a man is greater than that emanating from a dead
rat even. A soldier’s dead body was found after 4 days. While
carrying him, the fingers of the soldiers were also entering
into his body. The dead body had to be removed. The soldier
had died during the course of firing. His last rites were to be
performed. Even after the application of soap for 7 days, the
foul smell didn’t die out completely. In fact, this whole body
is full of foul smell and vices. Nevertheless, the Soul has no
trace of such things. It remains in its natural, pure and simple
form. All like children. This is because a child behaves as a
Soul by the time the clever brain gets developed. When he
grows a bit, the brain begins to play its role and the simplicity
of the child is overshadowed. It means, the Mind, intellect etc.
have spoiled the natural behaviour of the Soul.
The Soul in all the creatures is the same. Even while dealing
with the dreaded people, I found in them a glimpse of love.
That is to say, one thing is common in all the creatures.
Not only the Soul but the nature of Munn is also to be
seen in everyone. Every Soul residing in a body develops a
love for it. The opposing forces are present in every one of
us. They drag us to the path of destruction.
Anhad Loot Hoat Ghat Bheetar,
Ghatt Ka Maram Na Jana.
Sahib Kabir says that unchecked plunder and loot is taking
place within this human body. None has any information about
the healing touch to be provided.
Under the powerful dominance of Maya this Soul has
been forced to dance to its tune.
No creature wants to leave its body. The snake has
attained a very painful yuni. Still it wants to live. If you go
to kill it, it will prepare itself for its defence. Even if you
try to kill a mosquito, it will fly away. Clearly, the Soul
develops love for the body it attains. Though the material
pleasures are short-lived, yet man remains in search of these.


78 Sahib Bandgi

Even a slight change in temperature makes him unwell.
A close look at these pleasures will reveal their
uselessness. The first pleasure is related to the tongue.
However, the strange thing to note is that this tongue never
gets satiated. It feels the taste for some time and then again
becomes normal. There are six kinds of juices. If the tongue
desires to enjoy the taste of some sweet thing like a mango
or some sweets, it puts forth the demand. At other times, it
expresses the desire to enjoy some saltish thing though the
taste of this very thing also lasts for a few moments. In order
to satisfy this hunger for taste, often men create problem at
home. Some even begin to throw away the household articles
for the sake of this taste.
Jibhya Swad Ke Karne, Ner Keenhe Bahu Upaye.
Man devises many ways for the satisfaction of the tastes
related to the tongue.
How long can this taste last? The second pleasure is
related to the satisfaction of the sexual desires. In this
connection, I would like to repeat what Swami Viveka Nand
has said. According to him, if a thing can give so much
pleasure after coming out of the body, how much pleasure
it will give if it is allowed to remain in the body. Whatever
food we take, changes into blood. The blood changes into
Manja, the Manja changes into bones and then the formation
of semen takes place. Self-destruction alone is the end of
such a pleasure. These make a man suffer from various kinds
of ailments. The Vedas also ask us to spend the life of a
Brahmchari till 25 years of age. The life should be divided
into 4 parts. These are—Brahmcharya, Grahsath Ashram,
Vanprast and Sanyas. The Brahmcharya upto first 25 years
will help in making the bones strong. Semen is the fuel of
the bones and indulging in sexual activities is sure to damage
them. In addition, it will damage the power of the body to
fight the diseases. T.B. is one such disease that can be caused


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 79

by the loss of this vital fluid. I am of the view that diseases
have nothing to do with the nature of body. It is man himself
who invites them. Human body has the power to fight with
diseases. The animals indulge in sexual activities only for the
purpose of procreation.
Kami Kutta Tees Din, Antar Hoat Udas.
Kami Nar Kutta Sada, Chheh Ritu Barah Maas.
Even a lustful dog indulges in sexual activities for one
month. However, a lustful man behaves as a lustful dog
for all the twelve months.
That is why the animals are less prone to diseases. They
derive this energy from semen. After the first 25 years, one
can marry and enter into the Grahsath Ashram. After attaining
the age of 50 years, one should not even think of indulging
in sexual activities. This is because the menstrual cycle of
the women stops at this age and her feminine qualities remain
no more. The animals are wiser than human beings in this
respect are. When an ox finds that a cow has turned infertile,
it doesn’t go near it. The Vedas say that in the Vanprast
Ashram, the husband and wife should remain like milk and
water and should keep away from sexual activities. At this
stage, the blood formation also is reduced. Those who indulge
in such activities even at this stage, become irritable in nature.
This is because some tissues of the brain can function properly
only when they receive the energy from the semen and with
the decrease in semen, these tissues won’t be able to perform
their function well. Man doesn’t try to understand that such
lustful activities are not a source of pleasure. These are, rather,
a sort of punishment.
The third pleasure is related to the ears. The people remain
engrossed in music and dancing. I don’t see any pleasure in
it. The fourth one is the pleasure related to fragrance.
However, the most cruel pleasure is the one related to the
mouth. In order to satisfy the tastes of the tongue, man needs


80 Sahib Bandgi
money and has often to commit sins. For all such acts he has
to remain entangled in the cycle of births and deaths. Sahib
Kabir says in this regard—
Indri Pasara Rok Le, Sub Sukh Terey Pass.
If you control the manifestation of your Indriyas, you
will find all sorts of pleasures within you.
When you eat a potato, you seem to enjoy its taste.
However, if you turn your attention to some other place, you
won’t be able to enjoy its taste. The same is true for other
things as well. It clearly shows that the pleasure is not derived
from material things but from the Soul alone. Wherever you
fix your concentration, you will find the pleasure there. Mind
is a great cheat. It makes you believe that the taste lies in
enjoying the material things. Actually, it lies in your Surti
(concentration). From the very childhood, man begins to make
a search for pleasures. His source of pleasures goes on
changing with the passage of time. Man has turned his Surti
to a wrong place. There is need to fix it at the Guru. In fact,
the thing at whom man fixes his concentration, is his Guru.
Kami Ka Guru Kamini, Lobhi Ka Guru Daam.
Kabir Ka Guru Sant Hai, Santon Ka Guru Naam.
A Kami (lustful person) keeps his concentration at all
the times towards women. Therefore, the woman is the
guru of a Kami. The guru of a greedy person is wealth.
On the other hand, a sant is the guru of Kabir and the
Naam itself is the guru of the sants.
These days, the people have loaded their mobiles with
songs. This is the pleasure related to the ears.
One day, someone told me that he fell ill whenever he
ate chillies and that he had to do so after every 10-15 days.
What is the need of taking it when it is clear that it is going
to create problem. This is the pleasure related to the tongue.
Munn continues to fix your concentration at the place of its
choice.

The Musk lies within the Musk deer but out of
ignorance, it makes a search of it in a forest. Likewise,
Sahib is present within every human being though the fools
fail to have a knowledge of it.
What a pity that the grandeur of the Soul has got lost in
the large and well knit net of ignorance spread by Munn Maya.
Surti Phansi Sansar Mein, Ta Te Padd Gayo Dhoor.
The Surti has got entangled in the world. As a result, a
lot of dust has gathered on it.
A diamond has a splendid shine. But if it is placed in
dust, it fails to emanate its shine. As soon as it is cleaned, it
begins to spread its light. The dust can’t reduce the light and
shine of the diamond. It can only hide it for some time.
Likewise, our Surti is perfect in itself. It can be neither
increased nor decreased. Its qualities and virtues can never
fade. As such, it needs no external energy. Only the coating
of Munn Maya has clouded its light and shine.
Bahu Bandhan Te Bandhiya, Ek Vichara Jeev.
The poor jiva has been tied in many chains. Vices like
lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego are to be found in every
human being.
The lust is a very dangerous vice. It creates problems
even for one who lacks man power. It doesn’t spare the gods
even. These vices badly affect our thinking power. The army
of a devil is sure to be dangerous. These vices are at work
at all the times within man. The Soul feels helpless before
them. This is because of the fact that the Soul is ignorant of
its real identity and has mistakenly taken itself as Munn and
intellect.
Aapa Ko Aapa Hi Bandhiyo.
Sahib Kabir says that Soul itself has tied its ownself.

Kahain Kabir Nalni Ke Sugna, Tohi Kabne Pakro.
The Parrot got entangled in Nalni (a specially designed
apparatus). It put its feet on it. As a result, it began to rotate.
The feet of the parrot went upward while its body came

there was none to catch hold of it. It itself had caught hold
of Nalni.
Just see! Both the parrot as well as the monkey could
escape from the hands of the hunter if they had left the Nalni
and gram respectively. Likewise, it is not in the power of
Maya to keep the Soul in its grip. It has, of its own accord,
got entangled in the former’s grip.

## 12. Lost in the misconceptions, without a Satguru

#### without a Satguru,

Man has been wandering without a Satguru. He can’t realise
his Soul that has a rare power in it. It needs no extra energy.
The Satguru only removes the coating of Mind and Maya from
it. This step helps it realise its realself. Sahib Kabir says—
Bina Satguru Nar Phirat Bhulana.
Khojat Phirat Na Milat Thikana.
Man has been wandering for want of support from a
Satguru. Even inspite of his search, he is unable to find
his destination.
He has tried to explain as to how the Soul has lost its
own power.
Kehar Sut Ik Aan Gadriya, Pal Pose Ke Kiyo Siyana.
Once a Lion cub was mixed up with the goats of a
shepherd. It had got separated from its mother. The shepherd
took it along with his goats. It began to grow in their company.
Karat Kalol Phirat Anjiyan Sung,
Aapan Maram Unhoon Na Jana.
It began to play with the goats. It had no idea of its being
a Lion.
It ate grass along with them. What was the reason behind
taking grass? Sometimes, your children as well put dust into
mouth. The tongue (an Indriya) of the children is very sharp.
The earth has in it harmful elements as well. It is not a good
habit. However, some children get accustomed to it.
Likewise, the Soul has developed a bad habit of remaining
in the company of the Indriyas. My nephew was in the habit
of taking dust. His mother had told me about it. I asked her
to keep the home dust free. Afterwards, she told me that he

```
83
```

84 Sahib Bandgi

ate the dust from outside the house. I asked her not to let him
go out. One day, she said that he ate the dust sticking to the
soles of the shoes. Just see! How dirty his habit was. I told her
to keep the shoes at some high place. Then she said that he
licked the walls. There was no way out now. Our Munn has this
very nature.
Teen Lok Mein Munn Hin Viraji.
Tahin Na Cheenhat Pandit Qazi.
Sahib Kabir says that the Munn has its presence in the
entire 3 Lokas. The Pandits and Qazis fail to recognise this
fact.
Afterwards the child was admonished and even frightened
and it was then alone that he gave up the bad habit of eating
mud.
Likewise, grass is not a food for a lion. A buffalo had a
he-calf. Whenever I go near to give feed to the buffalo, it
holds my toe and pulls it. It has hurt both of my toes. Feeling
hungry, it wants something to eat though it knows that the
toe is not a right thing to eat. Probably the cub also must
have learnt to eat grass because of its failure to identify the
right food. Finding others eating grass it must have taken it
as the only eatable. It learnt to fight like goats. Instead of
roaring, it began to mew like them. The dog barks, the
elephant trumpets, the lion roars and the goats mew. The lion
has nothing to do with mewing but it learnt doing so from
the goats. Thus it had adopted its behaviour like that of goats.
It was the effect of company that turned it like the goats.
Whenever the shepherd beat the goats with a stick, it
did the same to the cub as well.
Like the other goats, it was also in his grip. Whenever it
lost its way, the shepherd searched it out. Can a man catch
hold of a lion? Certainly not. It was all due to the ill effect
of the company.
Mrigpati Aur Jungle Se Ayo.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 85

A lion from another forest came there.
Tahi Dekh Vo Bahu Drana.
The cub was frightened to see it.
A lion never eats the meat of dead animals. It doesn’t
attack from behind. Deer is its favourite dish. A deer can
jump upto a length of 27 feet whereas a lion has a jump of
about 28 feet. But its nature is to kill its prey after making it
run and run for some time. It takes the speed of the deer as
a challenge for itself and soon catches and kills it.
A lion that once takes the meat of man, doesn’t like to
kill other animals. This is because the very skin of man is
meat whereas the hair of animals has to be removed before
eating them.
So that lion saw the cub, eating grass along with the goats
and receiving the beating of sticks like them. It was against
the nature of a lion. It went near the cub. The latter was
frightened.
Once there was a man in the group of Langoors (monkey
like animals). He was also jumping like them. No man can
climb so fast on trees. In the company of Langoors he had
also become one like them.
Now the question arises as to how he became a langoor.
There are some things to be noted in this regard. The first is
that the langoor has 90% similarities with man. However,
the technical reasons are different from it. Why was he
jumping? This was because the taking of fruit and milk had
made his body flexible. During his infancy, the Langoorni
might have picked him up and fed him on its milk.
I read in some newspaper that a bitch used to go daily
to feed an infant left over by someone on a heap of rubbish.
The title of the article was ‘Motherly love of a bitch’.
Likewise, the Langoorni also might have picked up the child
and gave it its love and care. The child also must have taken
it as its mother. It is just the case of adopting a child. So he


86 Sahib Bandgi

must have learnt all the traits of Langoors but his structure
remained like that of human beings. Only the use of milk and
fruit had made him active and smart.
I don’t intend to say that one shouldn’t take food. This
is because the people often take my statements otherwise.
One day, someone asked me if the cow was the mother then
what should they call the buffalo? The people ask such like
questions. Two things distinguish a buffalo from a cow. The
buffalo first of all builds its body but the cow pays back
what it eats. The honest behaviour demands—
Jiska Pejiye Dhood, Tisko Kahiye Maye.
Take the being that feeds on her milk, as mother.
Therefore, that child remained cut off from man. He
jumped like other Langoors because he had drunk that milk.
He had learnt their language as well. The children have a
sharp memory. Once some people came to my Gurudev and
asked what a sort of Kalyug had made its appearance that
the child of man had become a Langoor. At this, the gurudev
had told them such a thing. He attacked men and irritated
them like other Langoors. He had learnt to hang upside down
as well. Probably, the cub had also behaved in the same
manner. A cow gave birth to a calf and died the next day.
Then the other cow began to feed it on its milk. It understood
that its mother had died. Then the calf was fed by a nipple.
At first, it offered some resistance but soon it understood
that there was no way out to take food. Our Soul seems to
have spoiled its behaviour in the company of Mind and
Indriyas. This is a hard reality. Lion asked the cub not to
feel afraid. The cub said that it (lion) would eat it up. The
lion told that it is also a lion. The cub said that he is a goat.
Pakad Bhaid Tahi Samjhana.
In order to make the cub understand the reality, the lion
took it to a spring and asked it to look into the water and
see for itself that both of them looked alike.The cub asked


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 87

if it was really a lion. The lion assured it of its being a lion.
The lion taught it to roar and make use of the claws while
hunting or fighting. The cub already was in possession of
that power. The lion only made it know of it. Likewise, the
power of the Soul has not declined. It has only got covered
up due to the coating of Munn and Maya.
The Lion told that it had got separated from its mother
and as such, had got mixed up with the goats. After teaching
it all that was necessary, the Lion let it go. All animals teach
their young ones—be they small like an ant or big like an
elephant or a giraffe. After the departure of the Lion from
the scene, the cub again mixed up with the goats. Now, when
the shepherd, as usual, raised the stick to beat it, it roared.
All the goats including the shepherd fled away for fear. The
gist of the story is that the cub (Soul, a part of Param Purush)
has been taking the poisonous grass in the company of sheep
(Indriyas) and the shepherd (Mind) has been beating it with
a stick. When the forest lions (real Satguru) meet the cub
(Soul), and take it to the spring of Dhyan and make it
understand that it is a Soul.
That is to say, it is the nature and behaviour that change
and not the actual power. Therefore, the sants create
awakening in the Soul. As a result, the Indriyas (goats) begin
to tremble out of fear. Mind loses its power when the Soul
refuses to obey its dictates. The guru removes the intoxication
of Maya. Then the jiva looses attraction for things. This is
the touchstone of the disappearance of intoxication. All are
under the intoxication of the evil forces.
After blessing the devotee with Naam, Satguru himself
sits on the driving seat. The Mind moves aside. The devotee
gains the power to watch the promptings of the inner enemies.
Even the Rishi-Munies, the yogis and other worshippers get
misled but the devotee is free. No mantra (incantation) can
help one see the inner enemies. It is only the power of Naam


88 Sahib Bandgi

that can help in this regard. Then the anger gives place to
dedication, attachment gives place to love, ego to faith and
lust to bliss. It is just the case of killing the opponent without
any weapon. None in the world has the power to kill these
enemies. All are under their grip. Only the shelter of a Satguru
can help in this regard. Then all those responsible for hiding
the real identity of the Soul become powerless.
Hari Kripa Jo Hoye To, Nahin Hoye To Nahin.
Kahain Kabir Guru Kripa Bin, Sakal Budhi Bah Jaye.
If God showers His grace, it is good. It hardly matters
if He doesn’t do so. But the grace of guru is a must. Without
it, the problems can’t be solved.
Guru Kripa Se Sadhu Kahavay.
Anal Pachh Havai Lok Sidhavay.
It is the grace of a guru that makes a man sage like. Such
a man goes to Amarlok after becoming like the bird, Anal.
The bird Anal was considered as the national bird because
of its having rare virtues. It has a very loving nature.
Anal Pachh Jo Rahey Akasha.
Nishi Din Rahey Pawan Ki Asha.

This bird remains in Shunya high above the earth. It would

Gaining conscience it moves towards its abode. Its parents

the Soul on its own moves towards its abode.
Now what is this grace of a guru? The greatest grace of
a guru is the act of blessing the disciple with Naam.
Sabhi Rasayan Main Ne Kiya. Nahin Naam Sum Koye.
I tried all the possible medicines but no medicine could
match the powerful effect of Naam.
But this Naam is not a worldly one. It is beyond the
Names related to the 52 letters and is a soundless sound. It
is bodiless, rare and a hidden one. Only the sants are in the
possession of it. Getting blessed with this Naam, the jiva
attains the power to reach Amarlok.
Yehi Badai Shabad Ki, Jaise Chumbak Bhaye.
Bina Shabad Nahin Ubrai, Keta Karey Upaye.
Just as a magnet attracts iron to itself, the Naam also
attracts the jiva towards itself after freeing it from the worldly
bondages.
Apart from this Naam, all other means are bound to fail
in helping the jiva reach its real abode.

## 13. Remains absorbed in Guru

#### (Gurumukh)

Some perform inward meditation. They do so in five
different ways. These are — Khechri, Bhoochri, Agochri etc.
Some do so in a casual manner without knowing the real
technique and without understanding as to where will such
a meditation take them. Sahib Kabir says—
Santo Shabdai Shabad Bakhana.
Shabad Phand Phansa Sub Koyi,
Shabad Nahin Pahchana.
Jo Jinka Aradhan Keenha, Tinka Kahun Thikana.
All are talking about word-sound but none could
understand it. I shall explain the abode one can attain on
the basis of different kinds of postures adopted in meditation.
Prathmai Pooran Purush Puratan, Panch Shabad Uchara.
Soham Satt Jyoti Niranjan, R-Rankar Aunkara.
At first, Poorna Purush uttered 5 words. These were—
Soham, Satt, Jyoti Niranjan, R-Rankar and Aunkara.
But none of these words is God. In fact, God is He who
has uttered these words.
Shabdai Nirgun Shabdai Sargun, Shabdai Ved Bakhana.
Shabdai Puni Kaya Ke Bheetar, Kari Baitha Asthana.
Gyani Yogi Pandit Qazi, Shabadai Mein Arujhana.
Panch Shabad Aur Panchon Mudra, Kaya Panch Thikana.
Shabad itself is Sagun as well Nirgun. Even the Vedas
are also talking about word. Even great yogis, Gyanis (learned
men), pandits and the like are entangled in these words. These
five words are to be found at 5 different places in the body.
The devotees meditate at these places through five
postures. How do they do so? Sahib Kabir says in this
90


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 91

regard—
Shabad Niranjan Chachri Mudra, So Hai Nainan Mahin.
Tehi Ko Jana Gorakh Yogi, Maha Tej Hai Tahi.
Gorakh Nathji fixed his concentration at a place within
the eyes. In Chachri Mudra, he recited the word ‘Niranjan’
Even today, many devotees perform this kind of worship.
However, Sahib Kabir has not asked us to fix our
concentration there. Those who fix their concentration at this
point, say that it can help in attaining Alakh Brahm.
Nevertheless, they don’t know that this abode falls within
the limit of Kaal. As such, they fail to move ahead. Here the
devotee succeeds in attaining some miraculous powers.
However, this is not the abode of Soul.
Shabad Aunkar Bhuchri Mudra, Trikuti Hai Asthana.
Vyas Dev Ta Ko Pahichana, Chand Surya So Jana.
Vyas ji fixed his concentration at Agya chakkar and
recited the word ‘Aum’. Doing so, a devotee can attain even
Mahakaran Dehi. He can see many big and small abodes.
Sahib Kabir says that even this falls within the limit of
3 lokas.
Sohang Shabad Agochri Mudra, Bhanwar Gufa Asthana.
Shuk Dev Ta Ko Pahichana, Sun Anhad Ki Tana.
Shuk Dev fixed his concentration at the musical notes and
recited the word ‘Sohang’. He derived pleasures from it.
Sahib Kabir and other sants have accepted the existence
of the musical notes. But they also say that these musical
notes are not God.
Anhad Ki Dhun Bhanwar Gufa Mein,
Ati Ghangoor Machaya Hai.
Baje Bajein Anek Bhanti Ke,
Suni Ke Munn Lalchaya Hai.
From within the Bhanwar Gufa the musical notes continue


92 Sahib Bandgi

to emanate. Different kinds of such notes fascinate the listener.
From here, these notes reach Sushumna. Thus, all have
talked about these musical notes emanating from within.
However, Sahib Kabir and other sants have never called these
as the real destination.
Jaap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mari Jaye.
Surit Samani Shabad Mein, Us Ko Kaal Na Khaye.
Recitation by mouth including inward recitation and
musical sounds will perish. But Kaal can’t devour Surti that
resides in the word.
Now the question arises as to what sort of a word it is
that is entirely different from the words found in the world.
Dwar Na Moondhey Pawna Na Rokey,
Nahin Anhad Arujhavai.
Soyi Satguru Mohin Bhavai.
I have liking for such a Satguru who asks me neither
to close the apertures nor to retain the air and nor entangles
me in the musical notes.
In fact, the word Sahib Kabir has talked about is the
‘soundless sound’. He further says—
Satt Shabad So Unmuni Mudra, Soyi Akash Sanehi.
Ta Mein Jhilmil Joat Dikhave, Jana Janak Videhi.
Those who make use of the Unmuni Mudra (posture),
recite the word ‘Satt’. Here the devotee has to fix his
concentration at Sahastarsar chakra. King Janak used to
practise this mudra and enjoyed the glare of a rare kind.
However, Sahib Kabir says that the destination is yet
far away.
R-Rankar Khechri Mudra, Daswan Dwar Thikana.
Brahma Vishno Maheswar Deva, R-Rankar Ko Jana.
Those who practise Khechri Mudra, recite the word ‘R-
Rankar’. Here the devotee fixes his concentration at the 10th


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 93

Dwara. Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh practice this Mudra.
All the Rishi-Munies, Siddhs and the like could reach upto
this dwara alone. Nevertheless, Sahib Kabir has said a very
startling thing in this regard.
Panch Shabad Au Panchon Mudra, Soyi Nishche Mana.
Aage Puran Purush Puratan, Us Ki Khabar Na Jana.
Sidh Sadhu Tridev Aadi Le, Panch Shabad Mein Atke.
Mudra Sadh Rahey Ghat Bheetar, Phir Aundhey Mukh Latke.
These worshippers took the five Mudras and the 5
words as the ultimate reality. They didn’t progress to
receive knowledge about Param Purush. They only
remained entangled in the 5 Mudras and the 5 words but
had to take birth again and again.
Iske Aage Bheid Hamara, Janeyga Koyi Jananhara.
Kahain Kabir Janeyga Soyi, Ja Per Kripa Satguru Ki Hoyi.
Sahib Kabir says that the secret related to him lies
beyond all this and only some enlightened Soul will be able
to know of it. He makes it clear that only such a devotee
who has the grace of a Satguru with him, can know that.
While going to Delhi, one has to go via Pathankot but
Pathankot is not the destination. It is the medium alone. It
is foolish to oppose yoga but it is equally foolish for the
yog practioner to think that he will be able to reach Amarlok
with the power of yoga.
Bin Satguru Pavey Nahin Koyi Kotin Karey Upaye.
However hard one may try, one can’t succeed in
attaining Amarlok without the grace and support of a real
Satguru.
Likewise, Sushumna is the medium and not the
destination.
All the Rishi-Munies of the earlier times talked about
Nirakar and the 3 Lokas alone. However, Sahib Kabir talked


94 Sahib Bandgi

about that what lay beyond all this. Gorakh Nath ji was
performing Pawan yog. He made some inward realisation and
thought that he had achieved his target. Actually, it was not so.
Sahib Kabir has also talked about Sushumna. In fact, he has
talked about everything and clearly told the limit of each. He
has taken the Sushumna as the medium and not a goal. That is
why he has said—
Ingla Vinshai Pingla Vinshai, Vinshai Sushuman Nadi.
Jab Unmuni Ki Tari Tootai, Tab Kahan Rahi Tumhari.
Ida, Pingla and Sushumna will perish away. Where

will you fix your concentration when the body itself will

perish?

```
Sahib Kabir imparted the knowledge about the soundless
```
sound to those who take the musical notes as God. None

can even dream of Anhad Brahm at a place where there are

musical notes. No kind of notes can be produced without

the striking of 2 elements. In such a case, we can’t take these
sounds as Param Purush.

```
There is no word present in air. Sound is produced when
```
it strikes some tree or other thing. That is to say, the word

will be produced only when the act of striking takes place.

The sound of ‘Sayen’ ‘Sayen’ in air is also due to the striking

of air. There can be no sound without the presence of 2

objects. Wherever there is the presence of two, there is Maya.

```
In the spiritual journey, we are moving ahead of all. There
```
is some secret in Ida and Pingla. He who meditates under

the guidance of a perfect guru, can know of this inherent
secret.

```
Sakal Pasara Maiti Ke, Munn Pawna Kar Ek.
Oonchi Tano Surti Ko, Tahan Dekho Purush Alekh.
```

Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 95

```
Sahib Kabir says that a devotee should remove his
```
concentration from everything. The whole play is that of

Surti. Creating a unison between Mind and air, he should

take his Surti to a height of 1¼ hands above the head.

Doing so, he will be able to have a vision of Param Purush.

```
However, without creating a unison between Ida and
```
Pingla, the Sushumna can’t be opened.(without opening

Sushmana meditation is useless)
Chakmak Pathri Rahat Ek Sung, Uthat Nahin Chingari.
Even if the Chakmak (a fire producing stone) stones

remain lying at a place, there can be no fire without the act

of rubbing.

```
The gate to the rare world lies in the Sushumna. For
```
opening this gate the unison between Ida and Pingla is a must.

Nevertheless, staying in Sushumna alone is not going to pay.

```
The Satguru’s abode is in the Surti lotus. All the sects
```
and panths in the world have talked about 7 plexus. Some

succeeded in reaching the 7th Chakra as well. However, all
these are within the body and as such, all the devotees remain

under the sway of Mind and Maya. They can’t awaken the

spiritual element.

```
During his dialogue with Gorakh Nath ji, Sahib Kabir
```
had asked where he would go after the perishing away of

all of his yogic powers.

```
The chakras (plexus) within the body are the abodes of
```
the gods. At the Manipur Chakra is the abode of Vishnu ji

and Lakshmi ji. At the Anhad Chakra is the abode of Shivji.
At the Agya Chakra is the abode of the Soul and at the

Sahastarsar chakra is the abode of Niranjan. The yogis fix
their concentration at the 7th chakra. However, the saints


96 Sahib Bandgi

say—

```
Surti Kamal Satguru Ko Vasa.
The abode of a Satguru is at the lotus of Surti.
All the Chakras fall within the limit of Niranjan. As such,
```
those who fix their concentration at any of those chakras,

can’t attain salvation.

is known to all but the secret related to the 8th plexus

can’t be attained from anyone else but a Satguru.

```
The Hansa that gets the eyes in the form of Naam, can
```
fly to any place it likes. It can see all the lokas that the Satguru

makes it see. None else can compete it. Therefore, a jiva
can attain salvation only by fixing concentration at Surti

Kamal, the abode of Satguru.

```
Sahib Kabir says that the reach of the gods, Rishi-Munies
```
and the like is upto the lotus with thousand petals and seven

plexus. But they have no knowledge about the 8th plexus

that lies above these.

```
Ours is a country of farmers. The seed is put in the earth

that has the power to help it sprout. It is not your problem

to bother about the way it will sprout and have leaves and

fruit etc. The earth possesses the property of doing all this.
The human body has been called as a rare attainment.

There is some definite reason behind saying so. Many systems

have been connected with it. Just as a large number of

Antennas are connected to a single tower, in the same manner,

many Antennas are connected to the human brain. These help

in providing energy to the body.

Sakal Pasara Mait Kar, Guru Mein Dey Samaye.

Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 99

seed has in it the quality of sprouting. However, it needs irrigation

and other needed material for its growth. A seed can’t sprout

in a closed room due to lack of sunlight and other needed

material.

```
Everything is hidden in this Surti. It only needs help for
```
sprouting. The rust of Munn-Maya on it has to be removed.

It can sprout with the power of Guru’s Surti. That is why

our Shastras as well have talked about meditating on a Living
Guru (Dhyana moolam Guru roopam). Nowhere can we

find a mention of meditating on God.

```
We can concentrate at a thing we are familiar with. We
```
can’t even think of concentrating at that which we have not

seen. As such, it is impossible to meditate on God whom

we haven’t seen. Such a meditation is going to prove fruitless.

So leaving aside all our misconceptions, we should

concentrate at our Guru alone. In fact, a Satguru is the

representative of Param Purush who is present in the Satguru

in the awakened state.
Every holy scripture speaks about the significance of a

Guru. Our holy scriptures have taken the guru as equivalent

to God and have highlighted the significance of meditating

on him.

Dhyan Moolam Guru Roopam.
Pooja Moolam Guru Padkam.
Mantar Moolam Guru Vakyam.
Moksh Moolam Guru Kripa.
One should concentrate at the appearance of Guru
and should worship his holy feet. His words should be taken

as incantation and his grace is the way to attain salvation.
So to say, no other worship is as great as that of devotion


100 Sahib Bandgi

to Satguru. The scriptures haven’t spoken about the grace of

God. The sants have also said the same thing.

```
Hari Kripa Jo Hoye To, Nahin Hoye To Nahin.
Kahain Kabir Guru Kripa Bin, Sakal Buddhi Bah Jahin.
It is good if God showers His grace. It hardly matters
```
if He doesn’t do so. But the grace of a guru is a must.

Things won’t work in the right direction without it.

It doesn’t mean that God has no significance. Just as
the water of the sea is saltish but it becomes sweet and useful

for drinking when the clouds bring it down. Though the water

is that of the sea, yet its properties have changed by the clouds.

Moreover, the sea has no power to take its water to every

part of the universe. Only the clouds have this power.

```
Likewise, there is a sandal tree. It has a great fragrance.
```
However, it is not in a position to send its fragrance to others.

The air absorbs its fragrance into itself and takes it to far

off places. Likewise, Param Purush is not in a position to

liberate the Souls on His own. He is like the Sandal tree
whereas the Satguru is like the air who produces the fragrance

and light of Param Purush in every human heart. Bulle shah

says—

```
Na Rub Main Teerthan Deethya, Na Roza Namaze.
Bulle Shah Nu Murshid Mileya, Andron Rub Lakhaya.
Neither he saw the vision of God at places of pilgrimage
```
nor in the observing of fasts or offering of Namaz. It was

only the grace of guru that enabled him have a vision of

God within his ownself.
Sahib Kabir has said—
Guru Hain Badey Govind Te, Munn Mein Dekh Vichar.
Hari Sumirai So Var Hai, Guru Sumirai So Par.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 101

```
A Guru is greater than God. Worship of God may not
```
help a devotee in attaining salvation but the worship of a

guru is sure to do so.

```
So, in the Durbar of God, it is the Sant Satgurus who
```
are all in all. The sants have considered the Guru as greater

than God even.

```
Guru Ke Sumiran Matar Se, Vinshat Vighan Anant.
Ta Te Sarva Rambh Mein, Dhyavat Hain Sab Sant.
Even the fixing of concentration at the Guru helps us
```
attain spiritual powers. We can’t attain these powers through

any yoga, worship etc. Yoga can only help us in attaining

miraculous powers but certainly not the spiritual ones. In

fact, whenever we go to some sant Satguru, we receive the

powers of Param Purush in three ways. First, through words.

Whenever we go to attend the Satsang, we receive the energy

when we listen to his words attentively. These reach us in a

manner the electric current reaches our room through wires

(Shombhasanam). Secondly, during the course of offering
salutations (Sparshanam), Thirdly we receive these powers

when we look into the eyes of the Guru (Dharshanam).

Whenever we go to have a vision of the spiritually enlightened

persons, we try to look into their eyes. This is because we

want them to cast a look at us (Paras Surti- has the power to

transform). We think that we haven’t been able to have a

vision of them if they don’t look at us. These powers reach

us by touching the body of a Satguru but, out of respect, it

is advisable to touch their feet alone, while looking in to
their eyes.

We can receive these powers through meditation as
well. If we are not in a position to have a vision of the guru,


102 Sahib Bandgi

we can meditate on him to attain these powers. This Surti

(concentration) is a rare thing. For the time being, we become

one on whom we fix our concentration. If our Surti turns

towards anger, we shall also become likewise. If this Surti

turns towards bliss, we shall become blissful. In the same

manner, if we constantly fix our concentration at our Satguru,

we can become like him.

There is a great power in concentration. It is a scientific
truth that the virtues and qualities of a thing we touch with

our hands, reach us. If we touch some dirty thing, the particles

of dirt will stick to us. Fixing of concentration at the Satguru

helps us attain spiritual powers. It also makes the mind

powerless.

```
Some devotees try to attain these powers by directly
```
meditating on God. God possesses many miraculous powers.

However, man can’t attain these powers as he has no

information about Him. It is difficult to even imagine His

real form. Our imagination can’t bring before us His real
appearance. He is beyond the reach of words. So none can

meditate on Param Purush. Even the Shastras have not taken

the meditation on God as fruitful. We can attain the miraculous

powers related to God even by meditating on the Satguru.

So, leaving aside all sorts of doubts, we should fix our

concentration on the Satguru alone.

## 14. How can Soul realisation be attained

Everyone wants to attain Soul realisation. Nevertheless,
it is not easy for man to do so because it can’t be seen.
According to the Shastras, the Soul doesn’t perish in any
set of circumstances. This appears very strange, indeed. Man
has to wander about without the knowledge of Soul.
All of us, knowingly or unknowingly, say that we have
been entangled in the net of Mind-Maya. We can’t to get rid
of this grip. Why can’t we see our Soul? This question needs
our attention. It is a fact that we can have a knowledge of
our Soul. This can be done by creating a unison between
Surti (Power of concentration) and Nirti Power of Breathing-
Prana). Let’s try to know what Surti and Nirti stand for and
how we can create a unison between the two.
Our Surti is a very rare kind of thing. We make use of it
in doing all sorts of worldly functions. Surti is needed while
speaking, hearing and walking etc. Concentration (attention)
is another name of this Surti. If an accident takes place, the
people ask the driver where his attention had gone. Nirti is
another part of the Surti. This Nirti has got entangled in the
body. It is the driving force of the body. The movement of
hands and feet is Nirti. Nirti is jiva itself. It resides behind
the eyes and has got absorbed in air. Our breath is not moving
automatically. It will appear as if someone else has been
behind this act of breathing. The force that does so is Nirti.
The whole of our body has been functioning because of this
breathing activity. Nirti is present in our breath and has spread
in whole of the body. When someone dies, the people say

```
103
```

104 Sahib Bandgi

the yama has taken away his/her pranas. So to say, the Soul
resides in air.
Nirti has been absorbed within the body whereas the Surti
has been wandering about along with the Mind (Senses of
perception). In this way, the Surti is held in the grip of Mind
and Nirti in the grip of Maya. Both of them don’t allow the
Surti and Nirti to unite. The purpose of meditation is to attain
this unison. Soul realisation will be attained when Surti and
Nirti have a unison. Meditation implies to concentrate the
Surti and Nirti at one point after taking them away from the
external world and the body.
Now the question arises as to how the Mind has held
the Surti in its grip. There are four states of mind —mind,
intellect, remembrance (Memory) and ego. When it expresses
some desire, it is called as mind. The Soul has nothing to do
with desires. When the Mind takes some decision, it is called
as intellect. Suppose the Mind expresses a desire to construct
a room. The intellect decides whether to do so or not. If the
intellect takes the decision in favour of it, the third state
(remembrance) becomes active. It tells the place from where
the needed material can be purchased. Ego plays its part when
we actually go there so all the things like — my children,
my house etc. are nothing but concepts of Mind.
Munn continues to entangle our Soul in material objects
of the world.
In Sub Mil Jeev Ko Ghera.
The Munn and the Indriyas have together entangled the
Soul.
The Soul has been performing all sorts of tasks that are
in no way related to it. The job of cultivation, for instance,
is performed only to meet the needs of the body. The same
is true of other jobs as well.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 105

What has the Soul to do with all such jobs? It has no Indriyas
(senses) in it. As such, it has nothing to do with the lustful
activities. Just as a foundation is the basis of a raised structure,
in the same manner, ignorance is the basis of this entire universe.
The very existence of the universe vanishes with the attainment
of spiritual knowledge. When Ram ji asked Vashishath Muni
about the universe, the latter said, “O Ram! which universe are
you talking about? The universe has never been created. All
this is the misconception of your Chitt (remembrance). Remove
aside this Chitt and you will find no existence of this universe.”
The mind has been misleading the Soul all the 24 hours. The
very existence of the universe will vanish after attaining the
spiritual awareness in a manner the misconception of taking a
rope for a snake vanishes.
The Mind wants to maintain its grip on the Soul with some
definite purpose. It needs the energy of the Soul for the
performance of all of its activities. If the Soul is freed, nothing
will remain behind in the universe. It will have a deserted look.
What will happen if all become spiritually enlightened? Then
none will desire to do any work. This is because the Soul will
realise that no material of the universe can reach it. It has no
need for such materials. That is why the Mind has misled it.
The Mind is very dirty. It has in it vices like lust, anger,
greed, attachment and ego. All these five vices are full of
dirt and filth. These are the companions and weapons of Mind.
The Mind attacks the Soul with the help of these very
weapons. Had there been no lust, there would have been no
sexual activities and the process of creation would have halted.
Had there been no greed, none would have amassed material
objects and in the absence of attachment, none would have
brought up the young ones. In such a case, the parents would
have left their children in forests or would have thrown them


106 Sahib Bandgi

in the streams.
Just as every wire of a cage is meant for keeping the
bird in the cage, in the same manner, every nature of Mind
is meant for keeping the Soul in confinement. All these
together keep the Surti entangled in the outward world. The
Nirti through Maya has been entangled in the body through
breath. The breath, in fact, is the essence of the body.
Regarding these spiritual things, Gorakh Nath ji had the
following dialogue with Sahib Kabir—
Gorakh Nath : What is the essence within the body?
Sahib Kabir : Breath is the essence within the body.
Gorakh Nath : Wherefrom does it appear and where does
it disappear?
Sahib Kabir : It appears from Shunya and reaches the
solar plexus.(Manipura chakra- navel)
Gorakh Nath : It has no hands and feet and as such, how
can it be caught?
Sahib Kabir : It has no hands and feet. It can be caught
through Surti alone.
The lack of unison between Surti and Nirti is proving a
hindrance in the realisation of Soul. There is a great secret
in it. In fact, the breath has been moving from Shunya to
the navel region. There is need to make it move in the reverse
direction. This process will help in creating a unison between
Surti and Nirti. Goswamiji says—
Ulta Jaap Japa Jab Jana. Valmiki Bhaye Brahm Samana.
Valmiki became Brahm like only after reversing the
process of breathing.
This breath has to be taken upto a distance of 1¼ hands
above the head (the 8th plexus). With a continuous practice,
you will find it easy to do so. It must be remembered that
the breath will move upward with the power of Surti.
When the breath begins to move upward, the devotee
will find his body growing empty. Surti and Nirti will begin to


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 107

unite with each other. At such a moment, the mind will cleverly
take the Surti to some other place and at that very moment the
Nirti will come down to the navel region. This is because its
abode is in the breath and the breath was moving up with the
power of Surti. As a result, the whole play will come to an end.
In this connection Sahib Kabir says—
Pall Pall Surti Sambhal.
Control your Surti at every moment.
Surti ke dand se gher Munn Pawan ko.Pher ulta chaley.
Control your Munn with the stick of Surti and you will
succeed in taking your breath upward.
There is need to control this Mind as it has absorbed
itself in Surti as well as Nirti. The Surti gets concentrated
more and more when the breath begins to move towards the
8th plexus. The Munn won’t let it happen and will cleverly
divert it. As a result, the breath will fall to the navel region
and Nirti will scatter and get absorbed in the body. The real
appearance of Surti will be lost.
With the movement of Ida and Pingla the breath reaches the
navel. Sushumna will open only when both, Ida and Pingla unite.
Bahar Ka Patt Bandd Kar, Under Ka Patt Khol.
Remove your attention from the outside world and turn
it inward.
The breath after passing through Sushumna that lies in
between Ida and Pingla, will move towards Shunya at a height
of 1¼ hands. At this place the Surti and Nirti have to unite.
At this time the devotee shouldn’t nurture any desire to see
some choicest sights. Watch the movements of Mind. This
is because the Soul realisation can be attained only after
bringing it under control. When King Janak requested
Ashtavakara to help him in attaining spiritual knowledge,
the latter said, “I can give you spiritual knowledge within 2
minutes if you surrender your body, mind and wealth before
me.” The king Janak did so. Then Ashtavakara said, “From now


108 Sahib Bandgi

onward, your Munn has become that of mine. Your wealth as
well has become that of mine. So I order you not to express
any desire from your Mind and also not to take any decision
with your intellect. Moreover, neither you will use your chitt
to recollect anything nor you will use your ego to perform any
activity.”
After this he asked the king to close his eyes. The king
did so. Ashtavakar asked if he had realised anything. The
king replied that he had attained the needed spiritual
knowledge. King Janak deserved it and he got it.
The body will begin to grow empty when the degree of
concentration grows. The body begins to show the signs of
decay without the breath. Its awareness is due to the breath
alone. At this stage you won’t be able to make any movement
even if you desire to do so. Even inspite of seeing the hands
and feet, you won’t be able to make them do any job. The
Mind will try to frighten you saying you won’t be able to
get back your body. Great and strong hearted devotees also
get frightened at such a moment and begin to think about
their bodies. Then you will imagine yourself being lost in a
sea of darkness. Everyone has love and attachment for his
body. Later on, the devotee will feel as if he were breath
alone. Ignoring the clever moves of Mind to prevent you from
moving ahead, you should go ahead.
Shunya Mahal Chad Been Banaye.
Khule Dwar Satghar Ki.
When the breath stays at a height of 1¼ hands above
the head, the gateway to Amarlok opens.
One forgets everything related to one’s own identity and
attains the Soul realisation.
I don’t want to unfold these secrets so easily. This is
because my words are quickly imitated. Nevertheless, the
problem is that such people don’t want to leave their
materialistic approach. Purity is not to be found. Afterwards,


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 109

I shall appear as an unreal one. The followers of other panths
tell their Gurus that those belonging to the Sahib Bandgi panth
speak many great hitherto unfolded secrets. The sole aim of
every one seems to be that of attracting more and more
followers. All other sages have been expressing their view
points through the medium of T.V for a long time. They are
afraid lest their followers should desert them. So they tell
their disciples that they as well have a knowledge of these
things. Unlike before, I have started unlolding the secrets
at a slow pace.
A wrestler taught his disciple some techniques of
wrestling. Afterwards, the disciple threw a challenge to his
Guru as well. The Guru came and threw him down within a
minute. The disciple said that he hadn’t told him that very
technique. The Guru said that it was meant for that very day.
When your mother calls you from the room, you at once
recognise that it is the mother who is calling. Likewise, the
Guru remains at all the times within the disciple and himself
takes him to Amarlok. The parents can’t help their children
in the spiritual journey but the Gurus play the role of parents
as well. Those who go to Vaishno Devi, have first of all to
get a token. These are among some of the steps that have to
be taken before reaching the desired destination. The Muslims
say that the angels had taken Mohd. Sahib in the skies. That
Angel has his abode in the 8th plexus. He is ready to hold
you. You have simply to extend your hand towards him.
Sakal Pasara Meti Ke, Guru Mein Dey Samaye.
Kahain Kabir Dharam Dass Se, To Agam Panth Lakhaye.
Sahib Kabir says that a devotee should take his
concentration away from the material objects and should,
instead, fix it at the guru. This will enable him to achieve
his target.
Take it for granted, it is not possible for any devotee to
reach Amarlok on his own. That is why the people say that


110 Sahib Bandgi

the Guru has no role to play and that a devotee has to reach his
destination on his own. But Sahib Kabir says—
Koti Janam Ka Panth Tha,
Guru Pal Mein Diya Pahunchaye.
The guru helped in covering within moments the path
that couldn’t otherwise be covered in births together.
The Satguru gives the ticket for the place where the secret
has been lying.
Bhedi Bheid Khulan Na Paye. Jamin Aasman Ek Ho Jaye.
Even after trying hard the secret regarding Param Purush
can’t be unfolded.
What does the Satguru do with the Soul? He carries the
whole of Surti with him and moves ahead. Upto Brahmlok
the thought of being Mr. so and so remains. It appears as if
some thing or the other is getting lost and a feeling of some
separate identity begins to come.
The Satguru accompanies the disciple even beyond the
limit of Mahashunya.
No worldly Gurus takes upon himself the responsibility
of taking the disciple across the worldly ocean of existence.
This is because they are not in a position to do so, it is not
in their power. They themselves have never reached that place
and as such, have no power to take the disciples there. That
is why they ask them to reach their destination on their own
effort. However, it is we alone who say with guarantee that
the Satguru will take the disciple to his real abode.
I have created a great awakening in you. The rare power
will guide you at each step as to what you have to do. That
power will remain at all the times with you. Moving ahead,
the jiva goes on forgetting everything related to the world.
However, the existence of Munn remains there. After going
across the entire Brahmand, than appears Mahashunya. At
this moment, the Satguru absorbs the Soul of the disciple
within his ownself. He takes the Soul out only after crossing


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 111

the seven skies. The Soul asks the guru as to why he had absorbed
it within his ownself. The guru tells that the vast powers of
Niranjan and Adhya Shakti can snatch it even inspite of his
remaining along with.
After that, there comes a spot when the guru once again
absorbs the Soul of the disciple within his ownself. The bears
in North pole swim for thousands of miles with their young
ones on their backs.
Sahaj Jani Jano Sayi Ki Preeti.
It is very easy to love Param Purush.
Pahle Dhyan Guru Ka Dharo,
Surat Nirat Munn Pawan Chitaro.
Sehalna Dhun Mein Naam Ucharo,
Tabb Satguru Lahu Deedara Hai.
Meditate on the guru. It will help you in creating a
unison between Surat and Nirat.
These will then move upward towards the 8th plexus
and will enable you to have a vision of Satguru.
Satguru Daras Hoye Jabb Bhai,
Ve Dain Tum Ko Naam Chitayi.
After having a vision of Satguru, you will be able to
know the secret related to Naam.
This will enable you cross the limit of this Brahmand.
In this way, the jeevatma reaches Amarlok by the grace
of Satguru and has a vision of Param Purush the light of
whose one pore can put to insignificance the light of crores
and crores of Suns. If someone talks about reaching there
on one’s own, take it for granted he has no knowledge of
Amarlok.
Jehi Khojat Brahma Thakey, Sur Nar Muni Aaru Dev.
Kahain Kabir Suno Ho Sadhu, Ker Satguru Ki Saiv.
Brahma, Sur, Ner, Muni and the gods couldn’t succeed
in finding what lay beyond.
Sahib Kabir asks the devotees to serve the Satguru in


112 Sahib Bandgi

order to know this secret. Before reaching Amarlok, they have
to pass through the ocean of Surti. There the existence of
Mind remains no more. On entering into this ocean of Surti
the Satguru tells the disciple that they won’t talk any more.
The worldly language becomes meaningless there because
that place is far beyond the limit of Mind and intellect.
Then comes the Amarlok. The Soul itself has a brilliance
equivalent to that of 16 Suns. In Amarlok the Soul has to
face the light of crores and crores of suns. It is just like the
case of entering into a room that has light of many watts
brightness in it.
Just as the Sun is at its own place but its rays spread
everywhere on the earth, in the same manner, Param Purush
is at His own place. On getting absorbed into Him, the Soul
doesn’t return back. In the first attempt, many steps have to
be crossed to reach there but, in subsequent attempt, such
steps are not needed. Simply by fixing concentration here,
one can get absorbed there.
There is such a great attraction in this Surti. This is also
called as the Vihangam chaal (way of Bird).
Kahain Kabir Vihangam Chaal Hamari.
Sahib Kabir says that he has Vihangam like movements.
Sometimes, I ask some religious minded persons whether
there exists Satlok or not. They say it does exist. When I
ask them whether they have visited there. They simply repeat
the sayings of Sahib Kabir. When I ask some such fellow as
to how many times he visited there, he says that he did so
many a times. When I ask him the way to reach there every
time, he says that he reached there every time following the
same path. I at once guess that the fellow is telling a lie.
At present, some sages have started imitating me. Earlier
they were speaking on some other things. Wherefrom did
they receive such a knowledge all of a sudden? Their disciples
seem to be at a loss to understand this sudden change.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 113

This is because the people belonging to other panths are
coming into our fold. These sages want to give the impression
that they too have the knowledge about all that Sahibji has.
They listen to my sermons with concentration. I had said
much earlier that these sages and Gurus will imitate me in
the time to come. This was to happen because Niranjan had
told Sahib Kabir that he would float panths in his name and
would mislead the people. The devotees will not be able to
find out the distinction between the real and the unreal path
and Sant.
I think, soon I would have to give a proof about what is
the message our panth has been spreading.
Sahib Kabir says—
Ek Bar Jo Darshan Pavey. Dekhi Bahuri Balamb Na Lavey.
Those who have His vision once, don’t have to use
much time again.
The Vihangam chaal is for the sants whereas the worldly
Gurus remain wandering in Papeel marg (Ants) and Meen
marg (Fish) only.
Naturally, he who has no knowledge about it, will speak
about one’s own earnings. Some say they are at a loss to
understand as to how the Guru will take them across. They
are right in saying so. This is because they don’t know that
formula.
It is the Satguru himself who gives the devotee the power
to reach the 8th plexus. The people say the child starts suckling
its mother soon after its birth but it is a fact that it is the
mother who gives it the power to do so. The mother puts
her nipple into the mouth of the child and the rest of the job
has to be performed by the child itself. The fact is that its
mother provides even that very power to the child. The mother
gives this power to the child when it is in her womb. Likewise,
the Satguru will provide the power to his disciple in the
material world as well as in the spiritual world. The Surti of


114 Sahib Bandgi

the disciple can move to the 8th plexus only with the power
given by the Satguru.
Paras Surti Sant Ke Pasa.
It is the saints alone who have this Paras Surti with
them.
If the guru doesn’t possess this Paras Surti with him,
take for granted, he is cheating his disciples.
If a person without manly power, enters into a wedlock,
he commits a fraud. This is because the sole purpose of
marriage is to produce children, procreation. A lotus begins
to bloom on receiving the sunlight because the Sun is a source
of energy. Likewise, a vast evergy can be received from the
Satguru. Like the Sun, Satguru gives his power to the disciple.
Bahut Guru Hain Us Jag Mahin.
Harey Dravya Dukh Koyi Nahin.
There are many gurus in the world who possess no power
to remove the sorrows and sufferings of the devotees. They
are interested in amassing wealth only.
So there is need to recognise a Guru who can save us
from the cycle of repeated births and deaths. A perfect guru
remains within you and brings a sea change in your life.
Guru Samana Shishya Mein, Shishya Liya Kar Neh.
Bilgaye Bilge Nahin, Ek Roop Do Deh.
When the guru absorbs himself within the disciple,
the two become one though outwardly they appear to have
separate physcial bodies.
Guru Bin Bhav Nidhi Tarei Na Koyi.
None can cross the worldly ocean without the support
of a guru.


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 115

## 15. They are our own

The worldly people continue to make a search for sensual
pleasures. They seem to have no time at their disposal. Does
the child like to go to school? Certainly ‘ not’ will be the
answer. However, the parents remain worried about it. This
is because they know that the time to come would prove hard
for him. Likewise, an enlightened Soul knows that the worldly
people don’t pay any effort towards the attainment of
salvation.
I personally go to every place. What purpose does it
serve? He who fails to come to Ranjri, reaches there. The
Gurus of other panths don’t do so. I give you Bliss to enjoy.
We are thus producing virtuous persons. In plain words we
can say that if a person fails to find some virgin, he has to
satisfy himself by marrying a divorcee or some widow. We
as well seem to be helpless in this regard. We are asking
even the drunkards to come to us because we have faith in
our power, to reform and transform them. Others seem to
be disturbed and perturbed over these very things. They use
abusive language on us because they think their followers
are deserting them. If you do harm to anyone, he would use
abusive language for you. You will have to bear all this.
Those belonging to other panths want to create the
impression that their panth is great in comparison to that of
others. Some try to construct big Ashrams. The elephant is,
no doubt, great but it lacks the guts to stand before a lion.
The same is the case of a camel as well. What quality does
the Lion have in it? It is the best beast of prey. No other
animal can compete with it.
Can some fellow control a cat with hands? It is not easy
to do so. The Lion is many times bigger and powerful than
a cat. Its skin is very thick. If you pierce it with a knife and
115


116 Sahib Bandgi

then take it (knife) out, its skin will soon regain its original
form. Its claws are powerful enough to take out about 2 Kg.
of flesh with a single stroke. Its mouth is so powerful that it
can kill big animals by attacking their necks. It has such a
supple body that it can cover a distance of about 28 feet in
a single jump. Small injuries can do no harm to it. It never
runs for fear.
We are also strong enough to face all sorts of onslaughts.
If ever I would move out, it would solely be with an objective
to create awakening among the people living in other countries
as well. We have not to remain bound within the limits of
India. In other countries of the world there are many
individuals who have the grace of Param Purush with them.
They have also to be taken out of the worldly ocean flux
and pain.
Why is their enmity between a crow and a cuckoo? The
problem is that the cuckoo doesn’t know the art of sitting
on its eggs in order to hatch them. It has a long tail but a
very small body. A snake doesn’t know the art of making its
house. It takes forcible occupation of a rat’s hole.
The Koyal (male cuckoo) and the Kokila (female cuckoo)
go in the area of crows to see where some female crow has
laid 4 or 5 eggs. The crows feel offended on seeing them.
They chase them away. The male cuckoo runs at a fast speed.
The crows can’t reach it and thus reach far from their nests.
In the meantime, the female cuckoo places her own egg in
one of the nests, takes away one egg of the crow, and throws
it at some far off place. It does this so that the crow may not
be able to know of it. If the number of eggs increases, the
crow can doubt it. Then the female crow sits on them and
hatches them. That is why the number of cuckoos is showing
a fall. Once again the male cuckoo reaches the nest and the


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 117

crows chase it away. The female cuckoo then comes and speaks
its voice to the baby cuckoo.
Nij Kul Vachan Sunat Sut Jaga.
The baby cuckoo listens to this voice attentively.
It is but natural. The female cuckoo tells it that it is not
a crow but a cuckoo. It hides itself as soon as it finds the
crow approaching. So to say, it tells its young one that it
has no relation with the crow. The young one understands
it. I have also narrated to you the whole story of Niranjan.
When the baby cuckoo grows a little, the male cuckoo comes
again and reaches the nest. The crow as usual follows it.
The female cuckoo then comes and takes away its young
one. On returning, the crow finds one baby crow missing
and thinks the cuckoo has taken it away to turn it into a
cuckoo. The crow doesn’t know that the missing baby was
not a baby crow but a baby cuckoo. In fact, the cuckoo has
taken its own young one and not that of the crow. Likewise,
we are also taking our jivas to Amarlok.
Kaal Ka Jeev Maney Nahin, Kotin Kahoon Samujhaye.
Main Kheenchat Hoon Satlok Ko, Yeh Bandha Yampur Jaye.
The jiva of Kaal doesn’t try to understand its own
identity inspite of my repeated attempts in this regard. I
try to pull it to Satlok whereas it prefers to go to the abode
of Yama tied in chains.
We have to perform a hard task. Whenever we try to
construct some Ashram or try to hold a Satsang, the hypocrites
misled people put all sorts of obstacles in our path. When I
hold a Satsang at some place, the opponents assemble to hold
a meeting on that very night.
Jagat Bhagat Mein Bair Hai, Charon Yug Parman.
All the 4 yugas bear witness to the fact that the worldly
people remain hostile to the real devotees.


118 Sahib Bandgi

Your coming into the fold of Sahib Bandgi causes harm to
them. That is why they oppose us and we bear their opposition
silently. At some place, a Pandit lady used to recite her bhajans
(devotional songs) whenever any Satsang was held. The sole
reason behind it was that earlier the people used to donate her
something or the other and now that thing was no more to be
seen. She had to suffer a loss.
The seyanas (Tanthriks) as well have suffered much loss.
Befooling and cheating the people in the name of evil spirits
and the like was their sole source of livelihood. I saved my
Naamis from their clutches. They find themselves unfit for
any other job. We understand their compulsions but we have
to show the right path to the people. This is our compulsion.
If you have to worship, you should do it in a right way. The
heads of other panths also feel disturbed to find their followers
deserting them only to come into our fold. However, we are
not using force in bringing their followers to our fold. We
are just acting like a cuckoo.
So our opponents have some or the other kind of grudge
against us. It is the set back to their profession that forces
them to call me a militant, a muslim and the like. When the
women folk fight with each other, they beat their breasts and
hurl all sorts of cruses on each other. Nevertheless, it is a
fact that nothing of the sort happens to anyone. Such wrong
elements would try to drag you again into their fold.
Kahain Kabir Tu Basa Bhram Ke Desh.
Sahib Kabir says that the worldly people are living in
an abode where there are misconceptions and misconceptions
alone.
I know the extent to which you are following my words.

You are not taking these so minutely although these are finding
a place in your conscience. The waves of Mind don’t let these


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 119

settle well. A District Commissioner came to Akhnoor in
conection with some enquiry. He said that he had listened
to many speakers but their words created confusion in mind
whereas my words reached straight into his heart. He was a
Muslim and had taste for literature. I speak everything from
the depth of my heart and that is why my words reach your
hearts.
Kathni Ke Shoora Kerni Ke Koora.
Many people preach that which they don’t practise.
Life can prove worth living for the people if they preach
what they practise. Though I try to make you strong from
within, yet you get misled sometimes. This is due to the
unhealthy environment that is to be found all around you.
Don’t follow the worldly people. Don’t believe in what
the seyanas say. They describe every kind of ailment—be it
a headache or some other complicated problem—as the result
of evil spirits. I want to ask such people as to what is the
basis of their diagnosis.
You have been badly misled by the hypocrites. This has
been going on since ages together. Everywhere in the country
the people can be found worshipping the evil spirits. The
hypocrites have spread their network in the country to befool
and loot the people. You will have to exert great power to
pull yourself out of this net.
Such hypocrites work in a team spirit. They remain in
search of such people who can be misled easily. This helps
them earn their livelihood. Nevertheless, such people will
become our own. Whenever the reality dawns on them, they
come to us. I have blessed many such seyanas (posing to be
expert in driving away the evil spirits) with Naam. Your faith

in your Satguru shouldn’t waver. As said earlier, our job is
like that of a Kokila (female cuckoo). When it fails to take


120 Sahib Bandgi

its young one out of the nest, the latter becomes a crow and
eats all sorts of dirty things like other crows. The young one
of a cuckoo will be totally black.
You belong to Amarlok but you have been living in
this universe of Kaal Niranjan. I have come to bring this
fact to your attention. Just as the crows can do no harm to a
cuckoo while chasing it, in the same manner, Niranjan won’t
be able to do any harm to you provided your faith and
devotion remain firm.
Mujhe Hai Kaam Satguru Se, Duniya Roothe To Roothan De.
I have business with my Satguru alone. I don’t bother
whether the worldly people feel offended with me or not.
For such a disciple, Sahib Kabir says—
Guru Aagya Le Aavhi, Guru Aagya Le Jahin.
Kahain Kabir Ta Dass Ko, Teen Lok Darr Nahin.
A disciple, who moves about with Satguru’s permission,
need not worry from anyone in the entire 3 lokas.

Distinction Between A Guru and Satguru
The readers will find the frequent use of the words Guru
and Satguru in the books published by the Sahib Bandgi panth.
In the ordinary sense, we call even a teacher as a Guru

though his teachings are limited to the material world alone
and have nothing to do with the spiritual world.
It is in the spiritual line alone that we make use of the

words Guru or Satguru.
A Guru is considered as a religious teacher who possesses
the religious knowledge and is in a position to impart the


Seventy Dissolutions On The Path 121

same to his disciples for their upliftment.
We find the mention of the word ‘Guru’ in our holy
scriptures like the Ramayana, the Gita & the like. However,

it is important to know that the knowledge of a Guru is limited
to that of 3 lokas alone. As such a Guru can in no way be
expected to help us attain true salvation.

It is, rather, a Satguru alone who can help us in this regard.
Now the question arises as to how can we distinguish a Guru
from a Satgur? For this, we have to remember that there has
been no mention of the word ‘Satguru’ and “Sant” anywhere

in any holy scripture before the incarnation of Kabir Sahib.
A Satguru alone possesses the complete knowledge of the
4th loka. It was only Kabir Sahib who used this word for a

Guru who possesses the following seven virtues:
1. He should keep away from lustful life.

2. He should have no attachment.
3. He should depend on his own earnings.
4. He should not be greedy.
5. He should be truthful & unselfish.
6. He should have knowledge of all the holy scriptures.
7. He should have attained union with Param Purush.
   Such a Satguru alone has the power to bless the jivas
   with the real Naam and help them attain Amarlok—the abode

of Param Purush.
Therefore, wherever the readers may find the mention
of the word ‘Guru’ in relation to Param Purush, they should

have no doubt in their mind that the Guru mentioned is
Satguru alone.
