4 Sahib Bandgi

#### A Few Words

What is spiritualism? The people seem to have
associated spiritualism with Sargun and Nirgun forms of
worship alone. But, what do the Sargun as well as the Nirgun
stand for? Dadu Dayal ji says–
Koi Sargun Mein Reejh Raha, Koi Nirgun Thehraey.
Atpat Chaal Kabir Ki, Mujhse Kahi Na Jaey.
Some are entangled in Sargun while others are
entangled in Nirgun. But, it is difficult for me to
say anything about the moves of Kabir.
Sargun means that which we can see with our eyes
whereas Nirgun is that which is formless and can’t be seen
with eyes.
I had a chance to have some dialogue with a Nirankari.
I asked him what Nirakaar stood for. He said that they took
the five elements as destructible and so didn’t worship them.
They worshipped the One who is formless (Nirakaar).
I asked him what he meant by Nirakaar. Pointing to the space
in-between his hands, he said, “This is Nirakaar.” I asked him
what he meant by Sargun. He said that all the things made out
of the five material elements were Sargun. I asked him what
he meant by the five elements. He said that water, earth, air,
fire and sky were the five elements. I said, “The element earth
is understandable. We walk on it. The element fire is also
understandable. We light it. The element water is also
understandable. We use it for drinking etc. Likewise, the
element air is also understandable. We breathe in it. But tell
me about the element sky.” His reply created laughter. He
said that the word itself is the sky. I said that which he is
4


```
The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 5
```
seeing in-between the two hands is the element-sky.
What is word? Two things are involved in our act of
speaking. These are–air and earth. When you close your teeth
and fists, you will hear the echo-like sound. It means, the
musical sounds emanate due to the contraction of the nerves.
This is, so to say, the process related to the movement of our
body. Kabir Sahib has never described these sounds as God.
These are unreal, imaginary and misleading. I told the
fellow that taking the element sky as word was incorrect.
Since the sky is the fifth element, it means, you are
worshipping the fifth element. Those indulged in the worship
of the outward objects are taking their mode of worship as
related to spiritualism. So to say, the idol worshippers as well
as the worshippers of the Nirakaar (formless) are calling their
respective modes of worship as spiritual ones.
But, these are certainly not related to spiritualism in
any way. What does our soul look like? What activities does
it perform? What is its relation to the body? At what point
has it got connected to the mind? How did it begin to take
itself as the body? How can it free itself from the body as
well as the mind? The knowledge about all this is called as
spiritualism.


6 Sahib Bandgi

Jab Tak Guru Miley Nahin Saacha,
Tab Tak Guru Karo Dus Paancha.
Whenever we talk about Guru, a common statement of an
individual person comes in front of us where an individual speaks
about that, the presence of a Guru is already there in his life and he
can’t shun that Guru for attaining up the shelter of another Guru which
in his own terms is the biggest sin of life. He considers it same as
that of an example of a married woman who is living with her husband
and at the same time is having relation with another woman’s husband.
Now, for a moment let’s give a deep thought onto that thinking
while comparing it with the true worship of Supreme Lord. A question
arises that : Are you truly worshiping your own husband (Supreme
Lord/Sahib) or else’s husband? Sahib Ji has never marked the
worship of Niranjan, Adhya Shakti, Tridev, Siddh, Muni, Formless
God, God with Form, Gods-Goddesses, Brahm, Paar Brahm, Idols,
Om, Hari, Har, Ram, Krishan as the true worship of Supreme Lord
(Sahib). In reality none of the above is your true husband (means
that no soul is worshiping its true Supreme Lord) and all are having
relation with someone else’s husband because the worships to the
above said deities are in true sense is the worship of ‘Kaalpurush’
(Mind/God of Death).
So, now you decide about holding onto the shelter of such a
Guru who is leading you and guiding you towards building up a
relation with someone else’s husband who in reality is not your own
husband. It means that a Guru himself does not know about the true
husband (Supreme Lord). How can you expect from such a Guru
that he will help your soul in building up the true relation with your
own Supreme Lord (Sahib) i.e. how can a soul of a being attains
oneness with true Supreme Lord where every being is engaged into
the worships of different gods-goddesses which in reality has no
relation with soul. Only a true Guru knows about the true husband
of a being who will definitely lead you towards attaining up the
everlasting relationship with Supreme Lord, who is the husband of
all the souls (by considering every ‘soul’ as wife and ‘Sahib’ as
husband just to clarify the irrational thinking of the beings).

### Rare Is The Universe

### Created By Param Purush

Purush Shakti Jab Aan Samayi.
Phir Nahin Rokay Kaal Kasayi.
The butcher, in the guise of Kaal, can’t stop the
Soul that gets blessed with the powerful Alive Holy
Name related to Supreme Lord (Param Purush).
Everywhere the devotees are being told about the
importance of charitable acts, noble deeds, pilgrimages,
observing of fasts, service etc. Man has not been in a position
to decide as to what is the right way for salvation. As a result,
the soul has to assume the bodies of different species again
and again. Even after attaining the human body, one doesn’t
make any earnest attempt to seek the shelter of a Satguru who
alone can impart the knowledge of the real Naam (soundless
sound). All are engaged in the worship of only the external
Holy Names that are to be found in the religious scriptures
and are used in our writings. The real Alive Holy Name is the
soundless sound related to Supreme Lord and is not to be
found in any of the worldly religious scriptures. The power
of that ‘Naam’ can be obtained only through a real Satguru
who remains absorbed in Supreme Lord. Kabir Sahib showed
the path of attaining salvation through that rare ‘Naam’. The
Holy Names related to languages can’t give any power to the
**7**


8 Sahib Bandgi
soul. In this universe, we shall have to take care of our body
and soul in a manner our tongue lies safe in-between the teeth.
We shall have to turn our attention from the worldly comforts
to the well being of the soul.
Our soul, on account of its falling in the grip of mind,
has forgotten its supreme power. Instead, it is the mind that
is making full use of this power through the various organs
of the body. Through noble and bad deeds, the Soul is made
to assume bodies of different species again and again. It is
only after seeking the shelter of a Satguru that the Soul finds
the way to reach its original abode.
Kabir Sahib has cautioned us in a beautiful way–
Mann Jata To Janey De, Geh Ke Rakh Shareer.
Utra Pada Kaman Se, Kya Kar Sakta Teer.
Hold back your body and let the mind go where
it desires. An arrow taken off from the bow can
do no harm to anyone.
In the human body, the soul makes a search of truth.
Man, on the basis of his virtues, knowledge and meditation,
can’t cross the worldly ocean. You have attained the noble
virtues and have reposed your faith in one Supreme Lord
alone only after getting blessed with the soundless sound.
This Holy Name unites the soul with Supreme Lord as a result,
it begins to recognise itself and understand the tricks and
bondages of the mind. The latter can no longer make it dance
to its tune as usual.
There is a need to know the real mode of worship. Two
things are involved in worship. One is to meditate or to recite
the Naam and the second one is to have faith. Dyeing the cloth
in some particular colour, ringing of bells, dancing, worship
of stones and adoration of body etc. can’t be taken as the real
mode of worship. In fact, worship means to concentrate. Now


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 9
let’s turn to meditation and faith.
In whom should we have faith? What sort of a faith it
should be? The faith shouldn’t have any element of formality
in it. It should be natural, real and total. In fact, seeking shelter
is the first pillar.
Hai Yahan Satguru Bina Koi Moksh Ka Data Nahin.
In this universe, there is none but a Satguru who can help
a devotee to attain salvation.
But, the Guru should be a treasure-house of spiritual
knowledge. In ancient times, a Guru enjoyed a very high status.
To cite an instance, Arjun used to introduce himself
like this–
‘Dorone Shishya Kunti Puttra Arjun’
A disciple can attain full power of his Guru through
concentration. Even the marriages were solemnised not on
the basis of the likings of the boy and the girl but on the basis
of the knowledge that the parents of the boy and the girl had,
about each other’s family background. Likewise, the selection
of a Guru should also be made on the basis of his virtues and
certainly not on the basis of his appearance or his contacts
with the VIP’s and the politicians etc.
This is because it is the virtues and power of the Guru
that passes on to the disciples.
All the human beings are alike. The appearances
change after the passage of era’s together. Originally, the
colour and nature etc. of all was alike. The basic structure
was also alike. It is the afterward happenings that created the
differences. The Hansas of Param Purush have no variation
in colour and nature.
The sperms remain alive for 2 or 3 days only. This has
been happening since time immemorial. These find the food


10 Sahib Bandgi
within semen. After coming out of the semen these develop
a change in form. Their feeding on semen is responsible for
this change in form. Just as ghee is the purest form of milk,
the semen is also the purest form of blood. It is the 1/40th
part of your food that changes into blood. In the Marathon
race to reach the womb after leaving the semen, crores of
sperms die. Only one or two of them succeed in reaching
there. On mixing with the blood of the woman, the particular
sperm attains development there. All take different kinds of
food. The sperm formation depends on the kind of food taken.
That is why the original sperms that were alike in all respects,
changed into different kinds of beings with different
appearances.
The shape of creatures depends on the shape of
wombs. If we insert the sperms of a Pig into the womb of a
cow, the bodily shape of the new born will be like that of a
cow but it will display the nature and traits of the pig as well.
Likewise, the properties of milk of a Jersy cow are different
from those of a Desi cow. The milk of the latter is more tasty
and energetic. So the body of a man depends on the shape of
the womb of the woman.
Kabir Sahib revealed to Dharam Dass the secret related
to the creation of beings from air. Air has been produced from
the mouth of Kooramji. The secret of air coming from four
levels of Lokas is known to some rare saint alone. Describing
the head of Kooramji, he said that some sage or saint alone
can know that the Maya (illusion) has been absorbed in the
planet earth in eight different ways. The eight directions are
its recognition and these are called as the heads of Maya. Four
directions and four corners of these directions have been
considered as the eight heads. Apart from these, Niranjan


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 11
robbed Kooramji of his 3 heads. With these heads, he created
14 Bhavans (lokas). These are present within the human body
as well.
Kaal Purush has produced Jivas out of Hansas in the
air scattered in greater skies and in Shunya. The breath of Jivas
moves upward and then gets absorbed in the belly. The tiny
Jivas get absorbed in the blood particles of the creatures well
before the formation of semen.
Kabir Sahib says, “O Dharam Dass! try to understand
the fact that I am speaking to you. This is a very rare secret.
If the Jeev-Bindu (tiny Jiva) runs on its own, the Swanti air
won’t be able to touch it. All this will, once again, become
Shunya.
Keep this secret within your heart. The secret related
to air, that I have revealed to you, is insignificant before the
real Naam. The manifestation of Kaal lies in the description
of the secret related to air. Away from such 25 kinds of air is
to be found the ‘Soundless sound’.
He further says, “There is a great difference in
temperature of the womb of the mother and the outer
environment. That is why the child weeps after taking birth.
The nurse is the first Guru of the new born. In order to save
the child from the external environment, she keeps it wrapped
in cotton. The muscles of the head are the strongest of all.
The boundary (ring) of the opening of the womb is also very
strong. Striking the back part of its head repeatedly against
the opening of the womb, the child, on its own, comes out.
That is why the back side of the head of the child becomes
flat in the beginning.
The child remains delicate as long as it is in the womb
but after coming out, its body becomes somewhat hard within


12 Sahib Bandgi
15-20 minutes. Our behaviour and nature are influenced by
our parents. Even the scientific research has proved that the
short sized mothers can’t give birth to tall and well-built
children. The shape and size of a child also depends on the
shape of womb of the mother and the food taken by her. Age
of the child also is influenced by the parents. Adding the ages
of the mother and father and dividing it by 2 will give the idea
of life a child will live. There can be variation upto 10% in it.
In the very beginning, the sperms were alike and
so the 84 Lac classified species have basically the same
kind of sperms. After this, the development into an ant,

mosquito or elephant etc. depended on the kind of
womb where the sperms developed, came into existence.
Inserting the sperms of a Pig into the womb of a cow
will produce a Jersy cow and not a Pig. This is because

the womb is that of the cow whereas, otherwise, the
sperms are alike.
The virtues and powers will enter into the disciple due
to the influence of the Guru. It is a spiritual reality that a
disciple will display the traits of his Guru. Even today, one
finds the influence of Gurukuls in our castes, families etc.
In ‘Amarlok’, Supreme Lord and the Hansas are alike. This is
the reality about salvation.
Naam Satya Guru Satya, Aap Satya Jo Hoye.
Teen Satya Jab Ek Hon, Vish Se Amrit Hoye.
Even nectar can be produced out of poison when
all the three–Naam, Guru and the Jiva are real
and true.
It is in this context that Kabir Sahib called a perfect
Satguru as God, for a disciple. The true worship lies in making
total surrender before a Satguru, having complete faith in him


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 13
and fixing concentration at him. At the time of blessing the
disciple with Naam, the Guru himself enters into the heart
of the disciple and sows the seed of turning him like his
ownself. Kabir Sahib called it as the creation of male out of
male which is a rare type of creation.
A Satguru, at the time of blessing a devotee, keeps his
hand on his head and whispering the hidden Naam into his
ears, turns him into a Hansa. It is Param Purush who created
Niranjan, the creator of the 3 Lokas. Param Purush handed
over his parts (Hansas) alongwith Adhya Shakti to Niranjan
to rule over the Hansas after creating a universe like that of
Amarlok. He had not directed him to put the Souls in physical
bodies. The first seed and the first male (Niranjan) related
to the creation of universe is the creation of Supreme Lord
Himself. It is the same Niranjan (Kaal Purush) who, in the
guise of Mind, has entangled the Souls in the mayaic net of
repeated births and deaths. By blessing with the true Naam,
the Satguru turns the being like his ownself.
The feelings of a disciple becomes like this–
Jab Main Tha Tab Guru Nahin, Ab Guru Hai Main Naahin.
Prem Gali Ati Sankri, Ta Mein Doi Na Samahin.
When I was an egoist, there was no place in my heart for
a Guru. Now my ego is gone and wherever I see, I find
my Guru alone.
The Satguru, through his concentration, separates the
soul from mind at the time of blessing with ‘Naam’. The
disciple also pledges to surrender his body, mind and wealth
at the holy feet of his Guru. It is also called as Nootan
(smooth, purified and holy) Surat.
The Satguru, in the guise of a sailor, resides in the heart


14 Sahib Bandgi
of his disciple. This is the second birth that the disciple
experiences at the hands of his Satguru. The Kaal can’t stop
such a devotee from reaching back to Amarlok who performs
the worship surcharged with the power of Supreme Lord. That
is to say, a disciple should have full faith and confidence in
his Guru.
The human race with all sorts of comforts at its
disposal, has been in the grip of serious diseases. It is man
who has been manufacturing devastating arms and ammunition
and has been adulterating the eatables with poisonous
chemicals. Due to unhealthy food habits and the use of
polyster and nylon clothes, man has become more prone to
diseases than any other being. The birds and animals don’t
violate their eatable habits. No kinds of progress and
inventions can save the world from destruction and
dissolution. There is a need to have simple eatable habits and
to wear the clothes that are suitable to the body. Truthfulness,
non-violence, good moral character and faith in worship are
the traits that give power and marked distinction to the
disciples of Sahib Bandgi.
Concentration and recitation of the soundless sound
opens the door that leads to Amarlok. Also, it destroys all the
Karmas. In fact, getting blessed with the Alive Holy Name
from a Satguru and its recitation enable a devotee to
experience the light of rare spiritual knowledge within him.
Not only this much, he begins to enjoy the pleasures of
contentment and soothing comforts.

### The Scientif ic Signif icance

### Of Recitation Of Holy Naam

The Vedas and the Shastras speak volumes about
worship and devotion to Guru. Even the worship of thousands
of years can’t pay so much as the worship of a Guru can. A
true Guru blesses the devotees with such a Naam as the soul
is in great need of it.
Guru Sajeevan Naam Bataye, Jakey Bal Hansa Ghar Jaye.
A Guru blesses with such an Alive Holy Name which
enables the Hansa to reach back its original abode.
But, only a Satguru has the power to bless with such a
rare and miraculous Naam.
In Ramcharit Manas also, Sant Tulsi Dass Ji has
expressed similar views. He says–
Guru Bin Bhav Nidhi Tarey Na Koyi.
Hari Viranch Shankar Sam Hoyi.
None can cross the worldly ocean without the
support of a Guru. Even the gods like Vishnu,
Brahma, and Shiv don’t possess the power to
enable a devotee to do so.
Kabir Sahib has highlighted the status of a Guru thus–
Saat Deep Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Bada Na Koye.
Karta Karey Na Kar Sakey, Guru Karey So Hoye.
None in the seven continents and nine regions is as great

```

```

16 Sahib Bandgi
as a Guru. The creator may or may not do but a Guru
can do what he desires.
Now the question arises as to what sort of qualities
should a Guru possess.
Guru Guru Kahey Sakal Sansara, Guru Soyi Jo Bharm Nivara.
Whole of the world is talking of a Guru but a real Guru
is he who has the power to clear misconceptions.
Kabir Sahib has given definite guidelines for assaying
a Guru. He says that there are many Gurus in this world but
there is none who can give relief from sorrows and sufferings.
A Guru who adopts the profession of a Guru for the
sake of meeting his bodily needs alone, will go to hell
alongwith his descendants. So a devotee should first assay
well before seeking the shelter of some Guru.
What to talk of the removal of misconceptions, the vision of
the present day Gurus adds one more misconception. Family
holders are also posing themselves as Gurus. They are gaining
popularity by amassing more and more wealth. None makes
an attempt to find out some real Guru. People think that any
Guru can serve the purpose. They don’t take the trouble to
see whether the Guru they are going to seek the shelter of,
possesses the spiritual knowledge or other traits of a real
Guru or not.
Touching the holy feet of a perfect Guru and
concentrating at him is the key to salvation.
All the saints first offer salutations to their Gurus
because even remembering of him can cure the devotees
from all of their problems. A real Satguru alone is a treasure
from truthfulness and is full of contentment at all the times.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 17
Kabir Sahib says that he doesn’t hate even the culprits,
goons and thieves. All have the same soul. People adopt
wrongful means only to satisfy their ever increasing desires.
Due to ignorance and bad effect of evil company, man does
many wrong acts. Those for whom he does all sorts of dirty
acts, are interested in his wealth alone. They won’t share his
evil acts.
Many hypocrites, egotists, denouncers and evil minded
persons are to be seen in the guise of Gurus. Shun such Gurus
who are greedy and remain absorbed in lustful activities.
A Guru should be filled with a sense of pity,
forgiveness and contentment. He should be free from vices
like greed, attachment, ego etc. and should be a treasure-house
of spiritual knowledge. His behaviour should be pleasing and
his life should present a glimpse of simplicity. A devotee who
offers salutations in a humble manner at the holy feet of his
Guru, attains the merit equivalent to that of a great Yajya. This
is because it is the Guru who imparts the knowledge about
evil and noble deeds, truth and falsehood and the like and
makes the devotees firm in faith.
Ehi Vidhi Guru Ke Sharan Hoye, Karey Nirantar Saev.
Guru Sum Janey Aur Nahin, Tribhuvan Main Koi Dev.
Kabir Sahib says that one should serve under the shelter
of some perfect Guru and shouldn’t consider any other
deity in the 3 Lokas as equal to him.
A truly rich fellow is he who remains content at all
the times and concentrates at his Guru. Honesty is a must in
the field of worship. The saints come to the world to dye the
devotees in their own color and they don’t move along with
the waves of the world. In the field of worship, the people
have made the Gurus multicolored by making offerings of


18 Sahib Bandgi
dress as per their own choice. The materialistic pursuits have
made man dishonest. Why, at all, should one serve a Guru?
Worship doesn’t mean to bow one’s head before the
photo of a Guru. There is need to understand the real essence
of worship. It is Guru during his life time and Naam there
after, that is to be taken as supreme by a devotee. At the time
of getting blessed with Naam, a disciple surrenders his body,
mind and wealth from the core of his heart before the Guru.
Why does the Guru ask for these things? This is because all
these things are a cause of hindrance in the path of self
realisation. It is because of these that the soul has begun to
take itself as a body. Love for wealth is dangerous. Its loss
turns man like a mad. Man doesn’t feel so much hurt at the
loss of his son as he does at the loss of wealth. A Satguru
takes his disciple away from these three and turns him into a
soul. The desires, decisions, activities etc. are all related to
mind alone. Have faith in your Satguru. Concentration at him and
recitation of Naam will cure all your sufferings and sorrows.
Guru Ka Kathan Maan Sab Lijaey.
Satya Asatya Vichar Na Kijaey.
Obey faithfully all that a true Guru says without thinking
about the factors of truth or falsehood.
Although everything in this world is nothing but an
illusion, yet it appears to be true. If the body and the soul are
two separate things, how did the latter get misled? The fact
is that, as a result of taking different species at different times
as its abode, it has got accustomed to all this and doesn’t want
to leave the body. That is why the world appears to us as true.
The body is burnt to ashes because the soul wants to enter
into it and the bones are thrown into the river Ganges so that
these may get dissolved.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 19
Whenever there is some talk of Amarlok, the disciples
must be feeling a desire to see for themselves this Loka and
the nature of Hansas. The fact is that all of you know Amarlok
because that abode belongs to you. Niranjan created this
universe on the pattern of Amarlok. The difference, if any, is
that the Hansas at that place enjoy eternal pleasures whereas
you have to seek pleasures here. Moreover, unlike the pure
and natural pleasures in Amarlok, the pleasures to be found
here are related to the physical organs. Niranjan has to labour
hard to mislead the souls. Everyone thinks as to what kind of
a body he possesses. Everyone expresses his sense of false
ego infront of the weaker persons. Here all reap the reward
as per their deeds. This continues till ages together. On
seeking salvation, the soul doesn’t feel astonished as
everything appears to it as its own. A tussel goes on between
the soul and the mind. The latter hasn’t got absorbed in the
soul. It is a separate entity and will remain so but the closeness
is, no doubt, great.
That is why Kabir Sahib has said–
Mukti Bheid Main Kahun Vichari,
Ja Ko Nahin Janey Sansari.
Ja Ki Surat Lag Rahey Jehvan,
Kahey Kabir Pahunchaun Tehvan.
I am going to reveal the secret related to salvation. It is
not known to the worldly people. I shall take the devotee
to the place he concentrates at.
In the world, Niranjan is the only male and Adhya
Shakti is the only female. The constitution of the universe is
based on only one principle and that is–the performance of
deeds and reaping of fruit.


20 Sahib Bandgi
In Dwapar yug, it was not possible to kill Jalandhar.
This was due to the devotion of his wife to him. As such,
Vishnuji disguised himself as Jalandhar and destroyed her
modesty.
Surr Narr Muni Aur Devta, Saat Deep Nau Khand.
Kahey Kabir Sab Bhogya, Deh Dharey Ka Dand.
Kabir Sahib says that Surr, Narr, Munies, Gods and all
those living in seven continents and nine regions have
been going through the process of repeated births and
deaths and have been attaining the bodies as per their
Karmas.
Simply listening to the Vedas and the Puranas or their
study can’t enable anyone know the mayaic net of Niranjan.
All the shortcomings we find in various modes of worship
are due to this very net. Even the concepts about God are also
not the same. An impartial study reveals this variation. Man
does not seem to be certain as to which kind of worship he
should adopt.
The Vedas, the Shastras and the Holy Saints are talking
about concentration alone. But, there is no unanimity about
the deity we should concentrate at. The religious literature
of different panths and sects is also creating misconceptions.
Even the saints at first worshipped Kaal Purush. Their
sayings also spoke in his glory. Later on, after experiencing
the truth, they changed their views and concepts. That is why
even the sayings of the saints are creating misconceptions
among the people.
Concentration brings mind under control and enables
the soul perform its work. The sole aim of fixing
concentration is to realize the soul. But how will
concentration help a devotee to have spiritual knowledge and


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 21
how will he be able to know his soul?
The worldly people have not been able to understand
the mind. Instead, they are taking themselves as mind.
Kahey Kabir Kisey Samjhaun,
Sab Jagg Andha.
Ik Dui Hovey Unhein Samjhaun,
Sabai Laga Pituva Ka Dhandha.
Kabir Sahib says whom he should make understand the
reality. Whole of the world seems to be blind. If there is
one or two, he can make them understand but all are
engaged in the satisfaction of their bodily needs.
There are two states of mind–one is body related and
the other one is its subtle form. The visible identity of the
body is related to the mind alone. It is the mind that makes a
desire and it is the intellect (the 2nd state of mind) that makes
the needed planning for its execution. In its 3rd state
(remembrance), it tells us wherefrom we can get the needed
money or material and finally, in its 4th state of ego, it
actually performs the needed activity. Through these four
states the mind puts hurdles in the path of worship and mislead
all in the 3 Lokas.
Kabir Sahib has said that the shelter at the holy feet
of a Satguru is the only way to escape from the grip of mind
and to attain salvation. There are no musical notes and words
to be found in ‘Amarlok’. The musical notes that the
worshippers listen through the medium of yog, are unrelated
to God. There can be no musical note or word without the
presence of air.
The real Naam is not to be found in letters of alphabets.
The ‘Naam’ that Satguru blesses with is not the word. It is the
Bodiless Naam. This very real and hidden ‘Naam’ can help a


22 Sahib Bandgi
devotee have soul realisation with the blessings and grace of
a Satguru.
Naam Japat Daridri Bhala, Tooti Ghar Ki Chhan.
Kanchan Mandir Jari De, Jahan Na Satguru Naam.
Kabir Sahib says that a poor and wretched fellow who
recites the holy Naam (even though his house is in a
depleted condition) is better than the one who doesn’t
do so even though he lives in an elegant palace.
On the basis of one’s own earnings, none can cross
the worldly ocean even if he be a Rishi, Muni or Sanyasi.
Concentration of Naam has a scientific significance.
It takes the soul near God because the Satguru himself
remains absorbed in God and concentration at him is sure to
pay the devotee accordingly. Man becomes like one whom
he concentrates at. God resides in every breath of man but
there is a need to have a unison of recitation with Surat-Nirat.
Never let any breath go waste. None knows whether
he will be able to inhale again or not. No hurdle will stand in
the path of a devotee who uses his every breath in the
recitation of Naam. Hanuman performed all the tasks while
reciting Ram-Ram. It is not a hard kind of worship. It is easier
than the performance of yajyas, pilgrimages and austerities.
It costs nothing and also gives no trouble to the doer. It is
strange to find that none seems to be interested in paying any
thought to breaths, in-between which, lies our soul.
From Shunya (nothingness) our breath reaches the
navel. We have no control over our breath. Every organ of
our body owes its functioning to it. The nose only receives
it. This breath divides itself into 10 forms. These 10 forms
move into our nine nerves. Apan vayu resides at the anus and
excretes the faeces. Udan vayu resides in the belly and doesn’t
allow the Apan vayu to move up. Apan vayu is dirty and can


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 23
cause headache if it moves up. The 3rd one is the Pran vayu
that resides in the heart and is responsible for making our
heart beat. The fourth one is the Samaan vayu that resides in
the joints and makes the movement of our joints possible.
The fifth one is the Naag vayu that resides in the throat and
brings sleep. Sixth one is the Kirkil vayu that resides in the
nose and keeps all the vayus separate. If some vayus come
together, it separates them through the act of sneezing. The
seventh one is the Dev Dutt vayu that resides in our eye-
lashes and makes these move up and down to wink and thus
giving rest to our eyes. The eighth one is the Dhananjay vayu
that resides in our arms and chest and helps us in applying
force. The ninth one is the Jamhai vayu that signals us to take
rest when we feel laziness. The tenth one is the Servatan vayu
that resides in whole of the body and prevents it from
inflation. It maintains the balance of the body. Coming from
Shunya and entering into the body in different forms, this vital
force has been making the soul move from Shunya (sky) to
the navel. That is to say, the soul is breathing. This way, the
mind has tied the soul to the body. A Satguru, after blessing
the devotee with Naam, shows him the technique of soul
realisation by concentrating these breaths through meditation.
For achieving soul realisation, one needn’t go to any forest
or a cave. This universe belongs to Kaal Purush. The bondage
of the soul is due to considering its ownself as body. All of
us are living a materialistic life without having any knowledge
of the soul. No Peer, Paegambar, Rishi, Muni etc. had said
so before Kabir Sahib.
Jo Rakshak Tahan Cheenhat Naahin.
Jo Bhakshak Tahan Dhyan Lagai.
Peer Paegambar Kutub Auliya,


24 Sahib Bandgi
Kaal Niranjan Sab Ko Daliya.
The people, instead of meditating on the saviour,
are meditating on him who is the devourer. Kaal
Niranjan has devoured all–be they Peer,
Paegambars etc.
Man is trying to make a search of God in trees,
mountains, flowers etc. and is thus wasting away the precious
moments of his life. Kabir Sahib has explained everything
regarding the mind, soul, bondages, salvation, universes, inner
world etc. in the language of the common masses.
I have made a deep study of the religious faiths, food
habits etc. of the people residing in different parts of the
country. I have watched closely the cultural aspects of my
countrymen from Kashmir to Kanya Kumari and of the people
of Burma, Bangladesh and Pakistan during my service in army.
Those living in the middle of Himalayas (that are 400 km wide
and 3,200 km long) are considered as people living in hilly
areas. The Himalayas are a part of the palmir mountain. These
people take meat and wine and are the worshippers of Shiva.
No organisation has flourished in the eastern region of the
country comprising Asam, Arunanchal, Manipur, Meghalaya
and Mizoram. The people here are non vegetarian. This region
has also been called as Nagaland. In Vindyachal as well, the
offerings of animals are made to the deity. As such, the
violent activities take place there. Such factors have helped
in the spread of christianity in these areas.
The people living along the belt of Gujrat, Maharashtra,
Tamil and Kerala are also non vegetarians.
In Punjab, the majority of people are non-vegetarians.
People living in Himachal Pradesh, called as Dev Bhoomi (the
abode of the gods), are also non-vegetarians. The people living


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 25
in Haryana and Rajasthan are vegetarians but they take wine.
In the field of religion, the virtues like that of pity,
forgiveness and love count much. The only medicine that can
help Jiva attain salvation is the Satya Naam (real Naam) that
the Satguru blesses the devotees with.

```
Satya Shabd Sat Purush He Jano,
Naam Bina Sab Jhooth Bakhano.
Naam Chhod Nahin Aurhi Jano,
Nirgun Sargun Ek He Maano.
Nirgun Sargun Tey Naam Nyara,
Jo Chinhon So Hans Hamara.
Sahib Ji says that the true Alive Holy Name itself is
Satya Purush (Supreme Lord). Everything else is
illusion & unreal. Nirgun & Sargun can be treated as
alike. He who gets blessed with the true Alive Holy
Name becomes a Hansa.
```

#### Concentration Itself

Sumrit Naam Hoye Ujiyara, Sumar Sumar Utro Bhav Para.
The recitation of ‘Naam’ makes us spiritually
enlightened and its continuous practice helps us attain
salvation.
If man wants to attain salvation, he will have to seat in
his heart the true and real Naam that is rare from the Naams
(prevalent in the three Lokas). This rare Naam is related to
Param Purush and is far from the Naams related to the letters
of alphabets. Only a Satguru has the power to bless the
devotees with this Naam that can enable them cross the
worldly ocean of repeated births and deaths. The recitation
of this Naam can remove within moments the layers of deep
darkness and lust that have held man’s neck in their grip. The
wine in the form of lustful activities has spread itself. This
is the game of Kaal. Only the nectar of Naam can save us from
it. Without the real Naam, all the Rishi-Munies and the like
had to pass through the repeated cycle of births and deaths.
Their position was just like a fish without water. Visiting of
holy places, performance of Yog and Sargun form of worship
and other such worldly related activities prevented them from
attaining the real salvation. The worship of the 3 gunas (Sat,
Raj and Tam) has made man devoid of spiritual knowledge.

Kabir Sahib has fearlessly exposed the hypocrites and
the activities related to hypocrisy. It is not easy to open the
10th aperture even though we are talking about the 11th
aperture. Even to perform the Nirgun form of worship is a
very tedious job.
I have held discussions related to spiritualism with
many sages. This is because I had not involved myself in any
bondage. That is why I say–
Duniya Mein Hum Sab Se Achhe.
Na Ghar Na Dwar Na Biwi Na Bachche.
In the world, I consider myself as the best of all
because I have neither any house nor wife and
children to take care of.
I have visited all the holy places in India. I have tried
to watch closely all that is happening in the name of religion.
Unlike others, I talk to you on the basis of my experience
alone and not on the basis of any written work. Kabir Sahib
as well has said–
Tera Mera Mannva Kass Ik Hoyi Re.
Main Kehta Aankhan Ki Dekhi, Tu Kehta Kagaz Ki Lekhi.
Tera Mera Mannva Kass Ik Hoyi Re.
How can your mind as well as that of mine be the same
when I talk on the basis of my experience and you talk
on the basis of bookish knowledge.
The atmosphere that we see around us is very alarming.
I visit Hari Dwar twice or thrice a year. I am getting an Ashram
constructed there. In Kashi, I have got an Ashram constructed
and am getting these constructed at Mathura and Ayodhya as
well. Once I was taking a rally to Hari Dwar in connection
with the holding of a satsang and a Bhandara on the eve of


28 Sahib Bandgi
the auspicious day of incarnation of my Gurudev, Swami
Girdhranand Paramhans Ji Maharaj. I told all those who were
accompanying me not to wander here and there. Three
hundred devotees, including an old woman, were with me. A
beggar was sitting at Har ki Pauddi. With partly closed eyes
he was saying, “O woman! give me something in the Name
of God.” A woman from Punjab, who was with us, perhaps
failed to understand what I said and threw four annas on the
cloth of the beggar. The beggar looked at her in anger. Perhaps
he was thinking why none out of about 300 people had given
any alms to him. The beggar took the coin in his hand, opened
his eyes and looked at it in a style that could put even a hero
to shame. He threw the coin on the ground and saying what
could the four anna coin fetch. Luckily, I was also with that
woman. I told him that the four anna coins like that could
bring him Rs. 50 to 60 by evening and which would be
sufficient for meeting his needs like hunger etc. He said what
could Rs 50 to 60 matter when he had to pay one hundred
rupees to the husband (boss). He was sitting on the uppermost
step. A policeman was standing there. I asked him why he had
to pay so much amount. He said that he had to pay one
hundred rupees for begging at that place. If he didn’t do so,
he (policeman) would use his Lathi (stick) to make me leave
the place. I was astonished to know it and said that as per my
information only the hawkers, the operators of four wheelers
etc. who sold their articles on the road side had to pay a fixed
sum of money to the policemen. The beggar said, “Today, I
have been occupying this place but it is possible that the next
day someone else who offers to pay one hundred and twenty
five rupees as commission for begging, may replace me.”


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 29
Hearing this, I remembered an incident. A man said to
the beggar that he was lame and so was getting less alms. A
blind beggar could get much more as alms. The beggar
replied that it was not correct. He begged for 25 years posing
as a blind man. Growing tired of the small coins he used to
receive, he had started begging as a lame man. That is to say,
neither he was blind nor lame. We see such like acts of
cheating all around us.
Try to be cautious in the field of worship. The culprits
and cheaters in this field have over-shadowed even the
underworld people. I repeatedly say that I have come here
neither to denounce anyone nor to say anything like an
egotist. Many sages dye their hair. They make their appearance
attractive before delivering sermons. What for should a sage
dye his hair? A true sage should make his appearance
attraction-free. It means, Romance has also made its entry
in the field of worship. The wife of the Guru also appears on
the scene wearing a matching suit and fixing hair pins.
Sometimes, she will be seen wearing a cap while at other
times, she will be seen with a strange type of hair style. After
all, what does she intend to show. If she wants to talk about
God, what is the need of showing her attractive appearance.
Kabir Sahib says that dancing, jumping and beating of
drums are the acts of prostitutes and not that of worshippers.
He says that application of Tilak on forehead, wearing of
beads around neck (Mala), growing of hair on head and beard,
dyeing of clothes etc. have nothing to do with worship. In fact,
dancing and singing etc. are the games of mind. Param Purush
(Supreme Lord) is not at all pleased with such acts. Kabir
Sahib has beautifully exposed and opposed these acts of
hypocrisy.


30 Sahib Bandgi
Mann Na Rangaye Jogi, Rangaye Liya Kapda.
A yogi can’t be called as a real yogi if he simply dyes his
cloth without bothering to dye his mind.
Whenever I ask some sage to tell me about the 10th
aperture, he simply says that it lies in the Sushmana nerve and
when I ask him the whereabouts of the Sushmana nerve, he
says it lies in the 10th aperture. Believe me, in the whole of
India I put this very question to all the sages I met but none
could say anything regarding the secret of the 10th aperture.
We don’t envy those who preach about worship. But I feel
sad to know that they do so on the basis of bookish knowledge
alone without having any actual experience.
There is a great secret regarding the knowledge of the
10th aperture. Before knowing about it, there is need to have
a knowledge of the five Yogic postures. Some are entangled
in the outer world whereas others are entangled in these five
postures related to the inner world. Kabir Sahib says–
Paanch Shabd Aur Paanchon Mudra, Soyi Nischey Kar Mana.
Uske Aage Purush Puratan, Ja Ki Khabar Na Jaana.
The worldly people have taken only the five words and
the five postures as true but none knows the abode of
Param Purush that lies beyond it.
9 Naths and 84 Sidhs appeared in this universe. All of
them, including the sages and Tridevas, remained entangled
in the net of five yogic postures and had to pass through the
cycle of repeated births and deaths. So it is clear that these
postures can, in no way, help the devotees cross the worldly
ocean. The Tridevas (Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh) remained
entangled in the worship related to the fifth word (R-Rankar)
but couldn’t attain salvation.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 31
Ta Ke Aage Bheid Hamara, Janey Ga Koi Janan Hara.
Kahey Kabir Janey Ga Soi, Ja Par Kripa Satguru Ki Hoi.
Kabir Sahib says that only a devotee who has with him
the blessings of a Satguru, will be able to know more
about the secret related to him.
The modern sages don’t know even the techniques of
practising the five postures. Kabir Sahib told all this in detail
for the benefit of the common man.
Our ancestors tried to know themselves and tried to
see what lay inside the body with the help of these very
postures.
Pratham Pooran Purush Puratan, Paanch Shabd Uchara.
Sohang Satt Jyoti Niranjan Kahiye, R-Rankar Onkaara.
Kabir Sahib says that the Supreme Lord, at first, uttered
5 words. These 5 words were—Sohang, Satt, Jyoti
Niranjan, R-Rankar and Onkaar.
Sohang created air, Satt created the earth, Jyoti
Niranjan created fire, R-Rankar created the sky and Onkaar
created water. Let’s know the nature of these Mudras
(postures).
Chachri Mudra : In this Mudra, the concentration is
fixed at the 3rd Til that lies in-between the two eyes. The
devotee recites the Name Jyoti Niranjan.
It produces the state of Pragya (Turiya). Before
practising any Mudra, it is necessary to open the Ida and
Pingla nerves (channels) in order to enter the Sushumna
nerve. A union has to be created between Ida and Pingla.
Without doing so, nothing can be achieved. It is just like the
case of a wrestler who needs both–power as well as
technique–to gain victory over his opponent. Technique is the
king whereas power is the wazir. Defeat is certain if any of


32 Sahib Bandgi
these is found lacking. We breathe through our nose. In the
right nostril lies the Ida nerve while in the left nostril lies
the Pingla nerve. The concentration at the 3rd Til can be fixed
only by creating a union between Ida and Pingla.
Creating a union among the breath, Surat
(concentration) and Naam, the incoming breath gets reversed.
This practice makes the Sushumna open. After this, the
devotee fixes his concentration at the 3rd Til (a place in-
between the eyes).
In this posture, the recitation of Jyoti Niranjan creates
the Pragya state (Turiya). It brings a sort of intoxication. If
you look at the foremost part of your nose for about 30
seconds only, you will also experience a state of intoxication.
The devotee is able to see a strange light. He attains many
miraculous powers as well. Gorakh Nath ji was an expert in
it. Also, the forehead of such a devotee begins to glow and a
normal person can’t even look into his eyes. A continuous
practice makes the nervous system lying in-between the eyes,
awakened. A devotee can not only see all that happened in the
past but also can see all that is going to happen in future. But,
this is a sort of awakening of the cells only. The soul remains
unaffected. Kabir Sahib has described this state as–
Abhi Nahin Guru Ka Bachcha, Abhi Kachcha Re Kachcha.
The devotee still can’t be called as a true disciple of a
Guru. He is imperfect yet.
Even inspite of attaining miraculous powers, he will
remain entangled in the mayaic net. This technique is called
as the Papeel marg (a path like that of an ant).
Bhuchri Mudra : In this Mudra, the devotee fixes his
concentration at the Medula plexus. There are many universes
here. The nervous system of this place can be opened by the


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 33
recitation of the word ‘Om’. Here as well, the union between
Ida and Pingla has to be created. The devotee inhales up all
the ten kinds of air like Apaan, Udaan, Praan, Sman etc. with
the power of his Surti. On entering into the Sushumna, he sees
many Lok-Lokantars (big and small abodes).
How to enter the Bunk Canal. It is also called as the
Bhanwar Gufa. The devotee can hear 70 kinds of musical
sounds here. Hearing these, he attains the Pragya state. When
there is perfect fixation of concentration, he reaches the Loka
as per the musical note he fixes his concentration at. This is
just the case of a phone which displays the ring as per the
dialed number. If he fixes his concentration at the Dhun
(musical sound) of Shankh, he will reach the place where there
is Sahaster Dal Kamal (lotus with one thousand leaves). If he
fixes his concentration at the Dhun that is similar to that of
the whistle of the engine of a train, he will reach the abodes
like heaven etc. This is called as the Meen Marg (fish-like
path). The inward journey can be performed in 3 ways– Meen,
Papeel and Bihangam. Still, he won’t be able to cross the limit
of Mind. In this Mudra as well, the cells of the body alone
gets awakened while the soul remains unaffected. Vyas Dev
was an expert in it. Earlier, the locks used for the suitcases
were opened with the help of numbers but now one will be
able to open these with the help of a code-word. Likewise,
there are cell-locks in the body. Some lock opens with the
word ‘Jyoti Niranjan’ while the other one opens with the word
‘Om’. In fact, man possesses vast powers but he is ignorant
of these.
Agochari Mudra : In this Mudra, the devotee recites
the name ‘Sohang’ and fixes his concentration at some
particular sound and reaches into the Bhanwar Gufa. The


34 Sahib Bandgi
sounds he hears are so much pleasant that he likes to hear
them again and again.
Sohang Shabd Agochari Mudra, Bhanwar Gufa Asthana.
Shukdev Tiss Ko Pehchana, Sun Anhad Ki Tana.
Shukdev was an expert in the practice of this Mudra. He
used the word ‘Sohang’ to reach the Bhanwar Gufa.
This Mudra also helps the devotee to awaken his
nervous system. But Kabir Sahib says–
Jo Tum Pavan Gagan Chadavo, Karo Gufa Mein Vasa.
Gagna Pavna Donon Vinshai, Kahan Gayo Yog Tumhara.
He says that inhaling the air upto skies and entering into
the Bhanwar Gufa is not going to serve the purpose. As
the sky as well as the air are perishable, so where will
your yoga take you?
The word, Kabir Sahib talked about, is not related to
the musical sounds that a devotee can hear within him. These
Anhad Dhuns (jinglement of words) vanish on reaching the
Maha Shunya and the devotee can’t move further. Just as we
can’t speak from within water, in the same manner, the
musical sounds can’t reach beyond Maha Shunya. So our soul
remains in the grip of Mind.
Unmuni Mudra :
Satt Shabd So Unmuni Mudra, Soi Parkash Sanehi.
Ta Mein Jhilmil Jot Dikhana, Jana Janak Videhi.
Kabir Sahib says that in this Mudra, a devotee has to
recite the word ‘Satt’. He can see the glaring light. The
king Janak was an expert in the practice of this Mudra.
Creating a union between Ida and Pingla, he used to
recite the word ‘Satt’.
The first thing to note is that a devotee will have to
enter the Sushumna nerve if he desires to enter the world


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 35
within. Such a devotee becomes formless there. It means his
awareness creating force departs. In this Mudra as well, the
ten forms of air have to be combined. Still he can’t rid
himself of the bondage of mind.
Khechri Mudra : In this Mudra, the devotee, after
passing through the Sushmana nerve, recites the word R-
Rankar. He wanders in innumerable universes after going out
of the 10th aperture. This Mudra is also called as Pawan yog.
Only six yogeshwars have so far reached upto this place.
Brahma, Visnhu and Mahesh remain absorbed in this posture.
In Nirgun kind of worship, this Mudra occupies the highest
place. But, still a devotee fails to attain true soul realisation.
The six yogeshwars–Shiv, Duttatre, King Janak, Ved
Vyas, Vasudev Krishan and Gorakh Nath remained upto a
certain limit alone. They could see the manifestation but not
the ‘Amarlok’.
Kabir Sahib says that the mystery related to him lies
ahead and only a devotee who has the blessings and grace of
a Satguru with him, can be able to know of it. That is to say,
only a true Naam blessed by a perfect Guru can help in this
regard.
Kabir Sahib showed the common man a simple path
of attaining salvation. Though rishi-munies, yogis and
yogeshwars couldn’t reach Amarlok inspite of their hard
worships, yet an ordinary man can do so following this
technique. The only condition is to have the blessings of a
Satguru with him.
Now I’ll tell you the technique of opening the
Sushumna nerve.
In our body, the entire game is that of air. Ten forms
of air have their stay at 10 different places. All the diseases


36 Sahib Bandgi
are due to the air or gas. Even the problems of epilepsy and
neurology are due to the air alone. Arthritis is also due to this
very air alone. For entering into the Sushumna nerve, there
is need to inhale up these ten kinds of air. It is not a child’s
play to do so and therefore it is not a suitable path of worship
for the common man. Only a Brahmchari, under the able
guidance of a Guru, will be able to perform the yogic
practices. Telling the family holders the path of yoga is not
good.
When a man dies, the people say his Pranas (vital
force) have escaped. Our soul resides in the air that is in the
form of vital force.
A devotee has to inhale up the air from the pelvic
plexus and has to take it to the solar plexus. From the solar
plexus, he has to inhale it up to the lower mind plexus. From
here, he has to inhale it up to the region of throat. Then after
creating a union between Ida and Pingala, he has to perform
the breathing activity in the Ashtam Chakra (8th plexus). In
this way, all the ten Vayus of the entire body enter the
Sushumna nerve. This brings the entire body to a state of
cease.
Normally, our breath has been entering from the sky
into our navel region. Only its direction is reversed. That is
to say, it is made to move in the upward direction. All the airs
thus enter slowly into the Sushmana nerve. It has been closed
due to the presence of phlegm there and opens with the
pressure of the air.
But, the devotee has to be cautious. Even after the
opening of the Sushumna nerve, if his surti (concentration)
gets diverted on any account, the breath will again begin to


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 37
move downwards, towards the navel. The tenth aperture won’t
open then.
Chand Aur Chakor Ki Reet Se Dhyan Kar.
Pal Hi Pal Mein Dekh Ajooba.
Kabir Sahib says that our concentration should be like
that of the moon and the chakor. It will work miracles
within moments.
Sometimes, when whole of your concentration is fixed
at the Kapat (forehead), you will feel as if you were only neck
without any body-parts below. The mind will try to distract
your concentration. If the concentration gets diverted, the
direction of breath will again start moving towards the navel.
You will achieve nothing.
Goswami Tulsi Dass ji says–
Ulta Jaap Japa Jag Jana, Valmiki Bhaye Brahm Samana.
Reversing the direction of breath, Valmiki ji was able to
become Brahm-like.
You can also become Brahm-like. This technique of
changing the direction of breath is called as ‘Ulta Jaap’. It
doesn’t mean saying Mar-Mar instead of saying Ram-Ram,
as out of ignorance, some people say. The professors are
also, saying so like many sages too, imitating the professors
speak like this. None of them has entered into the inner world
and gained any practical experience like Valmikiji. The people
have also interpreted the religious books in their own way.
Paltoo Sahib has said–
Arey Haan Re Paltoo,
Gyan Bhoomi Ke Beech Chalat Hai Ulti Swansa.
O Paltoo, in-between the Gyan Bhoomi (Ida and Pingala)
moves the breath in the reverse direction.
So, after bringing a unison among the breath, Naam and


38 Sahib Bandgi
concentration, the devotee becomes awakened and feels as
if the breath were moving up, upto a distance of 1¼ hands
above the head. But, one has to be cautious.
Mira Bai has said–
Tahan Silhali Gael, Chaddun Gir Gir Paddun.
I fall and have to rise again and again as that place is very
slippery.
Sushumna Madhya Basey Niranjan,
Moonda Dasvan Dwara.
Within the Sushumna lies the abode of Niranjan. He has
closed the 10th aperture. Mind is present there.
It is Kaal that diverts the concentration again and again to the
outer world. It doesn’t allow the devotees to go into the world
within. So the concentration has to be like that of a Chakor
for the moon. Instead of changing the position of its feet, it
goes on rotating its neck because it doesn’t want to take the
risk of losing the sight of the moon. Afterwards, the devotee
will feel as if he were headless. The breath goes on moving
up.
This is also called as ‘Adhar Aasan’. Only one who has
frequently visited some place, can tell others about it with a
sense of confidence. Others can’t do so. The same is the case
of the inner world. Only one who has visited there, can guide
others about it. There are six bodies in your outwardly
looking one body. These are–Sthool, Sukshma, Kaaran, Maha
Kaaran, Gyan and Vigyan. If someone tells you that he visited
moon through helicopter, you won’t agree to it. This is
because the helicopter can only fly in air and is not fitted with
the machinery that can take it to the moon. Only a satellite
like the Apollo can reach moon. Likewise, none can reach
‘Amarlok’ with the help of the five yogic mudras. There is a


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 39
need of a perfect Guru if you want to move into the inner
world. If you try to do so simply on the basis of bookish
knowledge or on the guidelines of some imperfect Guru, you
would land yourself into trouble.
He who teaches upto the 8th or 10th standard, is called
as a master while he who teaches 10 + 1 or 10 +2 classes is
called as a lecturer. Then there are professors and others.
Likewise, the recitation of Naam lights the inner lamp.
Unlike other sages, we talk of the 11th aperture. If I
begin to speak on Amarlok (Satlok), I won’t be able to give
full description of it even in ten years. There are strange
secrets related to it. For the time being, I talk to you about,
so to say, alphabets alone.
We are talking of five things that none other has so
far talked about.
The whole of Universe (3 Lok’s) is perishable.
Teen Lok’s Se Bhin Pasara. Amarlok Satguru Ka Neyara.
The Amarlok of Satguru is a rare abode which is
altogether different from that of 3 Lok’s.
Teen Lok Parley Tarr Aayi, Chautha Lok Amar Hai Bhai.
Teen Lok Mein Jo Kuch Aaey, Kaal Niranjan Sab Ko Dahey.
There is dissolution upto the 3 Lok’s whereas the fourth
lok is beyond any kind of dissolution. Kaal Niranjan
devours everything that appears in the 3 Lok’s.
There are four kinds of salvation to be found in the 3
Lok’s. These are–Samipya, Salokya, Sarupya and Sayujya. The
Samipya kind of salvation will take the devotee to Pitar Lok
(Ancestoral World) but, once again, he will have to take birth
in this mortal world after staying in that World for thousands
of years. Salokya salvation will take the devotee to the
abodes like heaven but from there as well, he will have to
come back to this mortal world again after reaping the fruit
of his noble deeds there. In Sarupya salvation the devotee can,


40 Sahib Bandgi
at the most, reach Brahm Lok (as explained in yogic Mudras).
But, after his stay there for crores of years, he will, once
again, have to come back to this mortal world. In Sayujya
salvation, the devotee will be able to get absorbed in Nirakaar
Niranjan. This salvation will last till the period of great
dissolution alone. But, after the creation of the universe, he
will again have to pass through the cycle of repeated births
and deaths.
You will never have to return from Amarlok, the real
abode of each soul. This Amarlok is the place where the soul
can attain permanent salvation. There is some definite path
to reach every abode. For instance, the way to reach hell lies
in the performance of evil deeds like committing of thefts,
outraging the modesty of others women and so on. The way
to reach heaven lies in the performance of noble deeds like
causing no kind of trouble to anyone, having a good moral
character and so on. Yoga is the path to reach Brahm Lok.
Opening of the 10th aperture will also give you salvation till
the great dissolution.
The world is in the grip of Kaal Niranjan. The holy
saints have described Nirakaar (Formless), in whose worship
the worldly people are engaged, as the Kaal Purush.
Mann Hi Sarupi Dev Niranjan, Tohey Raha Bharmayi.
Hey Hansa Tu Amarlok Ka, Padda Kaal Bus Aayi.
Mann He Niranjan Mann He Onkaar, Mann He Hai Kartara.
Kabir Sahib says that mind itself is the Dev Niranjan who
has been misleading the Souls. The real abode of the Souls
is Amarlok but they have fallen in the grip of Kaal. It is
the mind itself that is Niranjan, Onkaar and the doer.
The world is in the hands of some devil force.
Saeyaad Ke Kabu Mein Hain Sab Jeev Bicharey.
All the Souls are entrapped in the powerful grip of the
devil hunter.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 41
We take only such a being as God who can kill
thousands of people with a single arrow or can cut the throat
of some hundred persons with a sword. It means, God is also
like Devil who has been slaughtering the beings and is putting
them in the cycle of repeated birth and death. Kabir Sahib
strongly refutes such a concept of God. He says–
Ye Sab Kaam Sahib Ke Nahin, Jhooth Kahat Sansara.
Sirjan Haar Na Byahi Sita, Karta Kans Na Mara.
Gopi Gwal Na Gokul Khela, Nahin Hiranaya Kashyap Uder Vidara.
All such acts are not performed by Sahib (Param
Purush). The world gives a wrong description of God.
Neither He carried on killings nor He married Sita. He
didn’t kill Kansa even. Also, neither He played in Gokul
with Gopies and Gwals (devotees of Lord Krishan) nor
He killed Hirnya Kashyap.
Jo Rakshak Taehn Cheenhat Nahin.
Jo Bhakshak Taehn Dhyan Lagai.
Instead of worshipping Him who is the saviour,
the worldly people are worshipping the one who
tortures them in every possible way.
The real Naam is a hidden one.
Koti Naam Sansar Mein, Tin Te Mukti Na Hoye.
Mool Naam Jo Gupt Hai, Janey Birla Koye.
Gupt Naam So Kaha Na Jaye, Likha Na Jaye.
Bin Satguru Koi Nahin Paye.
Kabir Sahib says that out of the prevalent
innumerable Naams in the world, none has the
power to help a devotee to attain permanent
salvation. The real Naam is a hidden one and only
some rare Guru has the knowledge of it. This
real Naam can neither be spoken nor can be
written and none can get blessed with it without
the grace of a Satguru.


42 Sahib Bandgi
Jab Lag Saar Naam Na Paye, Tab Lag Jeev Bhatka Khaye.
Unless, jiva didn’t get blessed with Saar Naam, he will
have to wander about.
The worldly people have taken all the Naams that they
find during the course of reading, writing and speaking, as the
true ones. How can the real Naam appear in words when the
soul is immortal and is a part of the all powerful and
imperishable Param Purush?
Satguru alone is the embodiment of all that is truth.
Saar Naam Guru Bin Nahin Pavey, Poora Guru Akeh Samjhaye.
Only a Satguru whose soul has got absorbed in Param
Purush, can be considered as competent to bless the Soul
with ‘Naam’.
The soul has forgotten its real identity and has fallen
in the grip of Mind. The Holy Names related to the lord of
3 Lok’s (that are found in scriptures/manuscripts) are
unrelated to the soul and can’t enable it realise its ownself
and Param Purush. The worldly Holy Names can’t give real
and limitless joys to the soul. These joys can be realised only
when the soul gets blessed with the hidden Saar Naam
(soundless sound) that is related to Param Purush. After this,
the soul will begin to understand the bondages of the mind
and will make an earnest attempt to reach its original abode
(Amarlok).
The Satguru creates within us the power of Naam with
the power of his own concentration. Just as a Conch receives
the Swanti drop and turns it into a pearl, the Satguru, with his
Paras Surti, can produce spiritual awakening within a disciple.
So, not only the Naam should be a real one, the Guru
also should be real. Also, the devotee who desires to get
blessed with such a real Naam, should have a complete and
unwavering faith in his Satguru. He who forgets his Satguru
and the Naam, will again fall in the grip of mind. The mind


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 43
will try to create hurdles in the path of worship but it will
have to be kept under control with the force generated from
the recitation of Naam. This is the only way for the devotee
to become a true and real disciple and the combination of all
these 3 realities alone will enable the soul to attain permanent
salvation from the poison-like world.
Kabir Sahib says that the disciple, Satguru and Param
Purush will form a meeting place like that of Amarlok.
The fourth Loka is beyond dissolution. In the three
Lokas, including the abodes related to 4 kinds of salvation,
there is no place where one can find everlasting peace.
Duson Disha Mein Laagi Aag, Kahey Kabir Kahan Jaiyo Bhaag.
All the ten directions have been engulfed with fire.
There is no place where one can run for safety.
The holy saints have talked of the mode of worship
that is beyond the limit of Sargun as well as Nirgun.
The worldly people have great misconceptions about
the true ways and means that can enable one have soul
realisation. None has thrown any light on the fourth Loka. In
the 3 Lok’s, there are 14 abodes. Our body itself is the
symbol of this manifestation. Seven Lokas are to be found
in the region that extends from the legs to the soles of feet.
These are– Atal, Vital, Sutal, Talatal, Mahatal, Rasatal and Patal
and seven more Lokas are to be found from above the legs
to the top of head. These are–Sidh Lok (the pelvic plexus)
which is the abode of Ganesh Ji. Brahm Lok is at the region
of penis. It is the abode of Brahma Ji and Savitri Ji. Vishnu
Lok is at the region of navel. It is the abode of Vishnu Ji and
Lakshmi Ji. Duadash Kamal (Anhad Chakra) is at the region
of heart. It is the abode of Shiv Ji and Parvati Ji. Shakti Lok
is at the region of throat. It is the abode of Adhya Shakti.
Above in the forehead (at Medula plexus), is the Atam
Lok (the abode of soul) and at the top of head is the


44 Sahib Bandgi
Sahastrasar Chakra (cerebral gland, the place where the ladies
put vermilion) which is the abode of Niranjan. Thus, there are
14 abodes that are also called as 14 Bhuvans. All of these are
perishable.
Teen Lok Pralay Tar Aai, Chautha Lok Amar Hai Bhai.
All the 3 Lok’s are perishable while the 4th Lok is
beyond dissolution.
Gann Gandharv Rishi-Muni Aur Deva.
Sab Mil Karein Niranjan Sewa.
Gann, Gandharv, Rishi-Munies and the gods are all
entangled in the worship of Niranjan.
In Amarlok, there are no separate classes like–high,
medium and low. Niranjan himself has his abode at the highest
place in the 3 Lok’s but he sends the jivas to the hell or heaven
for some definite period as per their Karmas. The Jivas have
to pass through the endless cycle of 84 Lac yunis (classified
species) related to the 4 Khanis (modes of birth like, through
egg, directly through body etc.) as per their Karmas. In
Amarlok, the soul, after being freed by the Satguru from the
effect of Karmas, is taken to Amarlok as a Hansa. There the
Hansa enjoys the eternal bliss. In the universe of Niranjan,
the soul can never realise its ownself. Even after attaining the
bodies of Rishi-Munies, Gann, Gandharvs and the like, it
remains unsatisfied. That is why the Satguru takes the
concentration of the devotee away from the gods, goddesses
and God of the 3 Lok’s and unites it with the Surat
(concentration) of the hidden Naam related to Param Purush.
In this act, the Satguru separates the soul from the mind. That
is why the true devotion and complete surrender before the
Satguru is called as the real worship.

### The Hidden ‘Naam’ And

### The Secret Related To The

### 4th Lok

A Soul can’t cross the limit of 3 Lok’s through yogic
postures and austerities. None has so far been able to do so.
All the Sidhs, Yogis, Sanyasis etc. in the past could
attain the powers limited upto the 3 Lokas alone. They could,
at the most, know about the 10th aperture and the secrets
related to it. They had no knowledge of the 11th aperture. The
five postures fall within the limit of yog.
Yoga as well, is of 2 kinds. One is called as the Sthool
yoga (physical exercise etc.) while the 2nd one is called as
Sukshma Yog/Surat Shabd Abhyas (Nirgun worship). It is the
act of awakening the power of the inner cells of the body
through concentration. The yogeshwars, through
concentration, used to see different abodes within them. But
all this was within the limit of Niranjan (God of Death).
Kabir Sahib says that the secret related to him is
different from it and is beyond these limits. He has brought
a unique revolution in the field of spiritualism. The holy saints
have talked about the 11th aperture.
There are 21 Lok’s in the whole universal creation. Out
of these, 14 Lok’s are within the body. Above it, there are 7
Lok’s in Mahashunya. These are–Achint Lok, Sohang Lok,
**45**


46 Sahib Bandgi
Mool Surti Lok, Ankur Lok, Ichha Lok, Vani Lok and Sahaj
Lok. Kabir Sahib has said that in the Achint Lok itself
countless universes like those of the 3 Lok’s can be
accommodated. There is a great difference between Shunya
and Mahashunya. Just as the land which is used for cultivation
alone is called as an agricultural land and that where there are
forests and mountains alone is called as a forest land.
Likewise, to whatever extent in the sky there is the existence
of 5 elements, the place is called as Shunya. The 3 Lok’s fall
within the limits of Shunya. Beyond this Shunya, lies the seven
universes of Mahashunya. These are also called as seven
Surtis. Then, Kabir Sahib has talked about ‘Amar Lok’ (the
abode of Param Purush) that lies beyond these seven
universes.
Achint Lok is the first one that lies in Mahashunya
above the 3 Lok’s. 3 Asankhya yojan above it, lies the Sohang
Lok. It has the light equivalent to that of crores of suns. Some
worship Sohang taking it as the ultimate Supreme being
(Param Purush).
Jo Jann Hoye Jauhri, Rattan Leh Bilgaye.
Sohang Sohang Jap Mua, Mithya Ja Nam Ganvaye.
Kabir Sahib says that only some assayer can assay the
Ratan (a precious stone). That is to say, he can know the
real Naam. On the other hand, the worshippers of Soham
and Sohang simply waste away their precious life.
His sayings contain many hidden secrets in them. None
else has so far been able to reach his level of wisdom. Mool
Surti Lok is the 3rd Lok in Mahashunya. Ther are no elements
to be found there. Just as a person passes through different
places and enjoys the fragrance of different flowers (like
rose, jasmine etc.) at each place even without sighting any


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 47
flower, likewise, the Lok’s in Mahashunya can only be
experienced though no kind of element is to be found there.
3 Asankhya Yojan away from it, lies the Ankur Lok. In one
yojan there are 12 kms. The scientists have been measuring
the huge distances in terms of light years while the saints have
done so in yojans.
Ankur Lok Te Aage Jana.
Ichha Naam Tahan Purush Bakhana.
Beyond the Ankur Lok, lies the Ichha Lok and beyond the
Ichha Lok, lies the Vani Lok.
Further away from the Vani Lok, lies the Sahaj Lok.
So there are seven Lok’s in Mahashunya upto the place of
Sahaj Purush. All the creations upto the Sahaj Lok are
perishable.
Beyond this, lies the Amar Lok. There is no
dissolution in Amarlok.
Sahaj Purush Te Aage Jayi, Adi Purush Ka Lok Dikhayi.
Sahaj Se Ek Asankhya Parmana, Tahvan Adi Purush Asthana.
At a distance of one Asankhya yojan from Sahaj Lok, lies
the loka of Adi Purush (Param Purush).
No kind of dissolution takes place over there.
Tehvan Nahin Pralay Ki Chhaya.
Nahin Tahan Kachhu Moh Aur Maya.
Also, there is no kind of attachment or any trace
of Maya (illusion) to be found there.
Even the 3 Gunas (Sat, Raj and Tam) are not to be
found there.
Brahma Vishnu Tahan Na Mahesha.
Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh are not to be found
there.


48 Sahib Bandgi
Moreover, Shiv Shakti, Onkaar, ten indriyas (senses),
five elements, lust, anger, attachment, greed and ego have no
existence over there.
Naad Bind Ko Tahan Na Pani.
Nahin Tahan Srishti Chaurasi Jani.
Chand Surya Taragan Nahin.
Nahin Tahan Divas Rahan Ki Chhahin.
84 Lac yunis, the sun, the moon, the stars, the day
and night as well are also not to be found over
there.
Daar Mool Tahan Briksh Na Chhaya.
Jeev Sheev Tahan Kaal Na Kaya.
Pawan Na Pani Purush Na Nari.
Hadd Anhad Tahan Nahin Vichari.
There is no existence of any tree, water, air, Kaal,
hadd or Anhad (limit or limitless) even to be
found there.
Tantar, Mantar Tahan Daridra Na Dhokha.
Narak Swarg Tahvan Nahin Dekha.
Tantar, mantar, poverty, deception, hell, heaven
are also not to be found over there.
Of the five elements, that are also responsible for the
formation of different colours, the element ‘water’ is present
at the place of our penis, the element ‘air’ is present at Ashat
Dal Kamal (navel), the element ‘fire’ is present in the mouth
while the element ‘sky’ is present in Sushumna nerve.
Kabir Sahib says that this body has limitless secrets
inherent in it and only some rare devotee can know of these.
All the Rishi-Munies, Sidhs and Sages of earlier times
worshipped hard in the forests and caves but failed to cross
the limit of Mind. They couldn’t have any knowledge of the


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 49
4th Lok. It is Sahib alone who revealed the secret regarding
Param Purush and His Amarlok where there is nothing like
birth and death, evil or noble deeds, Kaal, body or indriyas
and 25 forms of the five elements. According to him, this
soul is in the grip of Kaal that has misled it in every possible
way. So, Kabir Sahib cautioned the worldly people. His views
about non-violence are unique. He was against any kind of
killing. He was, no doubt, a great social reformer.
Jeev Na Maro Bapra, Sab Ke Ek Hi Praan.
Hatya Kabhun Na Chhoot Ti, Koti Padey Jo Puraan.
There should be no killings as all have the same
soul in them. Killings won’t let you escape
unharmed even after your death.
His sayings are full of secrets related to spiritualism.
He said that Param Purush is within every Soul.
Moko Kahan Dhunde Re Bandey,
Main To Tere Pass Mein.
Na Mein Japp Mein Na Main Tapp Mein,
Nahin Vratt Upvas Mein.
Kriya Karam Mein Main Nahin Rehta,
Nahin Yog Sanyas Mein.
Na Main Kashi Na Main Mathura,
Na Kaabe Kailash Mein.
Khoji Hoye To Turant Mil Jaun,

Kahey Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho,
Main Rehta Tere Pass Mein.
Where are you wandering in search of Me when I am very
much near you. I can’t be sighted through japp,
austerities, observing of fasts, performance of Karmas or
yogic postures, paying visits to holy places like Kashi,


50 Sahib Bandgi
Mathura, Kaaba or Kailash. I always remain with you
and you can meet me within a moment if you make an
earnest attempt to do so.
Neither he established any new religion nor he
supported any particular caste or community.
Kabira Khadda Bazaar Mein, Mange Sab Ki Khaer.
Na Kahu Se Dosti, Na Kahu Se Baer.
Kabir Sahib says that he has been standing in the bazaar
wishing good of all. Neither he has any friendship nor
an enmity towards anyone.
A man said, “Maharaj! did no other fellow, prior to
Kabir Sahib, give any message about God?”
I said, “The question is good. Kabir Sahib talked about
equality. He had come to create awakening in people and not
for creating awakening in any particular sect or creed.
Manush Ki Ek Jaat Pachhan, Ek Jaat Sakal Sansari.
Ek Raah Se Sab Jag Aaya, Ko Neecha Ko Bhaari.
He says that all the worldly people belong to one race.
All have been born in a similar way, so there arises no
question of high or low.
None before him had talked like that. He spoke in a
different way. His sayings showed the path of real worship.
Today, we are living in a scientific age. Though the scientists
have gathered much information about the universe, yet we
find ourselves in the grip of quarrels and misconceptions. All
this is due to ignorance alone.
Universe is also called as Anadi (limitless). Universe
means that which shows a continuous expansion. That is why
it is called as limitless. But it can perish in a day even. I shall
tell you how it will happen. This universe has been expanding
at the rate of 1 crore 80 Lac km/minute. So everything in the


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 51
universe is expanding. But everything that shows an
expansion, has to perish. A tree also shows a continuous
growth to a certain limit. Afterwards, it begins to show
retardation. You will say you haven’t seen any tree showing
retardation. But it happens so. Its leaves will begin to grow
less in number. Then its branches will start drying. With the
passage of time, the whole of tree will become dry. This is
because its roots will lose the power to draw the needed food
from the earth. Why does man grow old? There is only one
reason behind it. His digestion becomes poor. So, like a tree,
man also shows growth to a certain limit and then begins to
show a decrease. If we throw a stone, it has to return to the
earth again after covering some height. Man begins to show
a decrease after attaining 35 years of age. His eye sight starts
becoming weak, hair begins to grow white, the teeth begin to
get damaged, the power of hearing begins to decrease and so
on. After showing a continuous fall in health, he departs from
the world.
A Satguru awakens the spiritual powers within you.
Remember! every part has to get united with its whole. This
is certain. I shall cite some instances. Water is a part of the
ocean. You throw water in your home. It flows through the
drain and reaches some other water body. Finally, it mixes
with some river that takes it to the ocean. So to say, it has
the power to reach the ocean. Fire is a part of sun. Whenever
you burn the fire, its flames will rise upward. Air is a part of
sky and so gets absorbed in it. Likewise, our earth is revolving
round the sun due to the attraction of the latter. The earth will
perish as soon as this force of attraction vanishes. In a similar
manner, your soul is, at all the times, united with Param
Purush (Supreme Lord). Kabir Sahib has repeatedly said–


52 Sahib Bandgi
Jyon Til Mahin Tal Hai, Jyon Chakmak Mein Aag.
Tera Sai Tujh Mein Hai, Jaag Sakey To Jaag.
Just as oil is present in the seasame and fire is present
in the chakmak (a kind of stone), your real God is within
you and you can realize Him.
Param Prabhu Apne Hi Urr Payo
I realised Param Purush within myself
God resides within us and can be realised then and
there. No yoga can tell us about the ways and means that can
help a devotee reach the 4th Lok. Even the attainment of the
four kinds of salvation–Samipya, Salokya, Sayujya and
Saroopya–can’t help a devotee have soul realisation. All of
you see that the milk gets spoiled soon. The curd also gets
spoiled, though after somewhat longer time. Butter and
cheese also meet the same fate. But ghee, that is pure in every
respect, doesn’t get spoiled. So in all the Lok’s of universe,
soul realisation is not possible.
There is a difference between the soul and the Hansa.
Kabir Sahib has described the soul itself as a form of Brahm.
When this awakened energy enters some body, it is called as
Jiva. When it leaves the Pranas (vital force) and enters the
mind, it is called as Brahm. In this state as well, there is the
existence of mind and when it escapes away from the five
material elements and the mind-body, it is called as a Hansa.
They are the holy saints who have given it this name.
You have great powers within you. The Guru only
provides you the light in the form of ‘Naam’ that shatters the
darkness created by Mann-Maya. Kabir Sahib has thrown a lot
of light on the status and significance of a Satguru.
A Satguru neither tells you the way to realize God nor
entangles you in any yogic activity. He directly awakenes the


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 53
supreme power within you. This is called as ‘Naam’ (Alive
Holy Name) blessed by a real Satguru.
Koti Janam Ka Path Tha, Guru Pal Mein Diya Lakhaye.
A Satguru has the power to take soul to its original abode
within a moment. This task couldn’t be performed even
after taking countless births.
Paras Mein Aur Sant Mein, Tu Baddo Antro Jaan.
Paras To Kanchan Karey, Wo Kar Le Aap Samaan.
There is a great difference between a Paras stone and a
Saint. While the former has the power to change iron
into gold, the saint has the power to turn the disciple
like himself.
Kabir Sahib cautioned us not to take this human body
as an ordinary thing as even the god’s desire to attain it. This
is because they know the vast powers inherent in it. It is good
to awaken the hidden powers inherent within the body. It is
not bad to perform yoga for the health of the body but it is
certainly not good to remain absorbed in these. Without
awakening your spiritual power, you can’t cross the worldly
ocean. Performance of yoga and worship of outward things
of the world can’t help you in this regard. According to Kabir
Sahib, only a perfect Satguru can do so. That is why he has
accorded the Satguru a status higher than that of God even.
Without getting blessed with Naam from a Satguru, a devotee’s
soul can’t reach Amarlok. A study of the sayings of the holy
saints will reveal that they have followed the path shown by
Kabir Sahib and have also talked of that Amarlok. They have
followed in letter and spirit all that Kabir Sahib has said.
An altogether different thing that he gave to the world
in the field of worship, was the secret of the 11th aperture.
This aperture lies within your concentration. The yogis talk


54 Sahib Bandgi
upto the 10th aperture only. After speaking about the glory
of Naam, Kabir Sahib said that the Satguru will help you attain
salvation. He has clearly differentiated between the various
modes of worship. He says–
Nau Dwarey Sansaar Sab Dusvan Yogi Taar.
Ekadash Khidki Bani, Janat Sant Sujan.
The worldly people are familiar with nine apertures
(dwars) only whereas the yogis have the knowledge of
the 10th aperture as well. But, it is only the holy saints
who have the knowledge of the 11th aperture.
One can’t escape from the jaws of Kaal (Death) even
after escaping from the 10th aperture. It is just like the case
of a prisoner who is released for the time being on bail. Kabir
Sahib says–
Antt Samey Jab Jeev Ka Aayi, Yatha Karam Tab Dehi Payi.
After death, the jiva attains the body as per its Karmas.
Haeth Dwaar Se Pran Nikasa, Narak Khani Mein Paye Vasa.
If the pranas escapes from the anus, the Jiva will go to
hell.
The faeces and urine comes out at the time of death.
It means, the fellow was frightened on seeing Yamdoots.
Nabhi Dwaar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Jalchar Khani Mein Pragtai.
If, at the time of death, the pranas escapes through the
penis (urine passing aperture), the jiva will attain the
body of some water dweller (out of 9 lac species).
He will reach as per the way he departed.
Mukh Dwar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Ann Khani Mein Vasa Payi.
If the pranas escape through the mouth, the jiva will
attain the body of one that feeds on grain. Such a body
can be like that of a Ghun (crop eaters) etc.
Swaans Dwaar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Andaj Khani Mein Vasa Payi.
If the pranas escape through the nostrils, the Jiva will


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 55
attain the body of one that is born out of an egg. Such a
body can be like that of a bird etc.
Netra Dwaar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Makkhi Aadi Tann So Payi.
If the pranas escape through the eyes, the Jiva will attain
the body of a fly, mosquito etc.
Shravan Dwaar Se Jeev Jab Chala, Praet Deh Pavey
Tatkala.
If the pranas escape through the ears, the Jiva will, at
once, attain the Praet yuni (ghost). The body of such a
person will look fearful.
Dasham Dwaar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Swarg Lok Mein Vasa Payi.
If the Pranas escape through the 10th aperture, the Jiva
will reach heaven or such like places.
After reaping the fruit of its Karmas, he attains the
human body and will born in some royal family. The body of
such a person will look peaceful at the time of death.
Gyarvein Dwaar Se Jeev Chal Jayi.
Amarlok Mein Vasa Payi.
If the Pranas escape through the 11th aperture, the Jiva
will reach Amarlok, the abode of Param Purush.
Today, the scientists are telling about such things as
the scientists like Newton couldn’t even think of. New
researches with better equipments will reveal more and more
secrets related to the universe. Likewise, in the spiritual field,
Kabir Sahib revealed such secrets as other Peers, Sages,
Rishi-Munies etc. couldn’t even dream of.
‘Naam’ is the only support that can help a devotee
cross the worldly ocean. Guru Nanak Dev Ji and Goswami
Tulsi Dass Ji have also described the glory of ‘Naam’.
Tulsi Jag Mein Do Badey, Ek Naam Ek Daam.
Naam Milavey Peev Se, Daam Karey Sab Kaam.


56 Sahib Bandgi
Two things are considered great in the world. One is
‘Naam’ and the other one is wealth. While the ‘Naam’
makes a devotee realise God, wealth makes the mare go.
Kabir Sahib has highlighted the significance of ‘Naam’
alone. None has recognised this fact. But, what sort of a
‘Naam’ it should be? The people have not been able to
understand it. Such a Naam can certainly not be one that falls
within the limit of 52 known letters. Had it been so, there
would have been no need to go in search of any Guru. It is
not to be found in the sayings as well. Now the question arises
as to how will such a ‘Naam’ help us cross the worldly ocean.
Kabir Sahib says–
Koti Naam Sansaar Mein, Tintey Mukti Na Hoye.
Mool Naam Jo Gupt Hai, Janey Birla Koye.
There are countless ‘Naams’ in the world. The real
‘Naam’ is a hidden one and only some rare holy saint has
a knowledge of it.
Gupt Naam Bin Guru Nahin Pavey,
Poora Guru Akaeh Samjhave.
Only some perfect Satguru can bless the devotees with
this Naam. This Naam is ‘Akaeh’. That is to say, it can
neither be read nor reduced to writing.
Kahu Bheid Tohe Saar, Jo Pavey So Vach Hi
Nahin Sab Kaal Pasaar.
One can cross the limit of Kaal and can escape from it
only after getting blessed with this ‘Naam’. Otherwise,
there is no other way to escape from its grip.
Saar Shabd Satya Purush Kahaya.
Param Purush Himself is the Saar Shabd (soundless
sound).
Jab Hum Rahal Rahal Nahin Koyi

of what I say.
Just think over as to who is male and who is female.
These are the Names related to the structure of the body but
the soul within all is alike.
With what Name will you call that which is
unperishable and awakened and is always in a state of eternal
bliss. It has no colour or appearance. O man! there is nothing
that belongs to you or me. Ram, God, Shiv, Shakti etc. have
the same spiritual element and so whose prayer should we

perform. The Vedas, the Puranas, the Bible, the Quran etc. have
described it in different ways. None among the Hindus,
Muslims, Jains, Yogis, etc. knows that spiritual element. This
is the reason behind the division of mankind. Everyone, be
he may a Sanyasi, Jangam, Yogi, Sevdda, Brahman or the
Sage–speaks about that which he has taken as truth. Thus,
everyone is taking himself as an enlightened soul.
Kabir Sahib has thrown light on the origin of ‘Naams’ that the
worldly people have been reciting.
He says that Adhya Shakti gave Brahma the Universe
that has the earth with 7 continents and 9 regions (Khands).
Being pleased at the truthfulness of Vishnu, she praised him
and gave him the heaven. Shiv got Patal. Then she created three
women–Savitri, Lakshmi and Parvati. All in the 3 Lok’s were
charmed to see their beauty. In fact, Niranjan is the only male
and Adhya Shakti is the only female in the universe. Through
these two, the four Khanies (four categories for producing
beings) were created.

```
Guru Bin Mala Pherte, Guru Bin Detey Daan.
Guru Bin Daan Haram Hai, Puchho Ved Puran.
Sahib Ji says that even the acts of charity done without
a Guru are not considered as fruitful.

### “Sahib” Descended

### On The Earth From

### Amarlok

Kabir Sahib was not only a saint but a Sant Samrat
(emperor among saints) who produced a line of saints. He
had a rare individuality. Let’s see wherefrom did he come?
What was his motive behind coming? He himself has thrown
light on it.
Santo Avigat Se Hum Chaley Aaye.
Koi Bheid Maram Na paye.
He says that he has come from a place that is far
from the 3 Lok’s (Universe).
Na Hum Rehle Garabh Vaas Mein, Balak Hoey Dikhlaye.
Kashi Tatt Sarovar Oopar Tahan Julaha Paye.
Na Hamare Bhayi Bandhu Hain, Na Sang Girhi Dassi.
Neeru Ke Ghar Naam Dhraye, Jag Mein Ho Gayi Hansi.
Aane Takiya Ang Hamari, Ajar Amar Pur Dera.
Hukam Haisiyat Se Chal Aaye, Katan Yum Ka Phera.
Kashi Mein Hum Prakat Bhaye, Rama Nand Par Dhaye.
Kahey Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Hans Chetavan Aaye.
He says, “I didn’t stay in the womb. From the bank of a
sarovar at Kashi, the weaver lady sighted me. My Naam-
Karan (giving Name to the child) was performed in the
house of weaver Neeru and it made me a laughing stock
in the whole world. Neither I have any brother nor any
wife nor some maid servant. My abode is Amarlok and I
**59**


60 Sahib Bandgi
have come from that very place in the guise of human
form to liberate the Hansas from the grip of Kaalpurush
(God of death) as per the desire of Param Purush.
Appearing at Kashi, I sought the shelter of Swami Rama
Nand ji. O Saints! listen to what I say. I have come to
create awakening among the Hansas and to take them
back to Amarlok.”
The word Kabir means one who is without any material
body and is far away from the five material elements.
Just see the activities of the hypocrites. They created
unreal and misleading stories related to his birth simply to
prevent the people from going to him. It is they who have
coined the stories that he was born in the house of a weaver
and was either a Muslim or a Harijan. On the contrary, the
saints have said–
Gagan Mandal Se Utre, Satguru Satya Kabir.
Jag Mahin Paudan Kiya, Sab Peeron Ke Peer.
Satguru Satya Kabir descended on the earth from across
the skies. He was called as the peer of all the peers.
Kabir Sahib classified the worship in 3 parts–Sargun,
Nirgun and Pra.
Sargun Bhakti Karey Sansara, Nirgun Yogeshvar Anusara.
The worldly people perform the Sargun worship while
the yogeshvars perform the Nirgun worship.
Pra worship is the mode of worship that is far away
from that of the Sargun as well as the Nirgun. Dadu Dayal ji
has said–
Koi Sargun Mein Reejh Raha, Koi Nirgun Theraye.
Dadu Chaal Kabir Ki, Mosey Kahi Na Jaye.
Some are engaged in Sargun worship while others are
engaged in Nirgun worship. But it is not within my


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 61
power to say something about the moves of Kabir Sahib.
Guru Nanak Dev ji has said–
Avval Sant Kabir Hain, Dujhe Rama Nand.
Ta Se Bhakti Prakat Bhayi, Saat Deep Nav Khand.
Kabir Sahib is the fist saint while Rama Nand ji occupies
the second place. It is from them that the real mode of
worship spread in all the 7 continents and 9 regions.
Hakka Kabir Karim Tu, Be Aib Parvardigaar.
O Kabir, you are the flawless God.
Saint Garib Dass ji has said–
Anant Koti Brahmaand Mein, Bandi Chhod Kahaye.
So To Purush Kabir Hai, Janni Jana Na Maae.
In the innumerable universes, it is Kabir Sahib who is
considered as the liberator from bondages. No woman
gave birth to him and as such, he had no mother.
Sahib Purush Kabir Ne, Deh Dhari Na Koye.
Shabd Swaroopi Roop Hai, Ghat Ghat Boley Soye.
Kabir Sahib didn’t have any physical body. He is in the
form of formless word that speaks within everyone.
He is, in fact, the perfect Guru and God. The words
of the saints clearly show that Kabir Sahib was not a human
being. Think in a rational and impartial way and you will agree
to what I have been saying.
In 1398, on the eve of Chet Shudhi Purnima, Kabir
Sahib appeared in the morning, on a lotus flower at lahartara
pond in Kashi. A rare and dazzling light descended down on a
lotus flower and assumed the form of a child. At that time,
Ashtanand Ji, the disciple of Swami Ramanand Ji, was
meditating on the one side of the pond. He saw this light
descending. He rushed to his Guru and told him all about it.
Rama Nandji said that whole of the world will come to know


62 Sahib Bandgi
of it in due course of time. Neema, while returning alongwith
her husband from her parent’s house, passed that way. Neema
felt thirsty and went to the pond to quench her thirst. She
sighted a beautiful child moving about its hands and feet on a
lotus flower. She was attracted to it and brought it from there.
She told Neeru that she wanted to take it home. Neeru asked
her to leave it there as the village people would make fun of
them saying the girl had a child at the very time of Gaune (the
second visit to the house of in-laws). But Neema showed her
reluctance to leave such a beautiful child. Neeru began to beat
her at her refusal to leave the child. Unwillingly, she was going
to leave it when it said, “O Neema! out of love and devotion
I had met you in the previous births, I have now again come
to meet you. Take me alongwith you. I shall tell you the path
to salvation.”
What was the reason behind the worship and love of
the previous births? Let’s have a talk about it. In Dwapar yug,
there was a devotee of Kabir Sahib, Supach Sudarshan. He was
born in the family of a sweeper. Kabir Sahib had blessed him
with Naam. Kabir Sahib came to the world in all the four
yugas. He was called as Satya Sukrit in Sat yug, Muninder in
Treta yug, Karunamay in Dwapar and Kabir in Kal yug. Kabir
Sahib said–
Yugan Yugan Hum Yahan Chaley Aaye.
Jo Cheenha Tahan Lok Pathaye.
I have been coming to this mortal world since
yugas together and have been taking such jivas
to Amarlok who recognise me.
Supach Sudarshan had prayed to Kabir Sahib to bless
his parents as well with ‘Naam’ but they didn’t show any
interest. In the next birth, they were born as Brahmans but


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 63
still they didn’t believe in the mode of worship shown by
Kabir Sahib. In the 3rd birth as well, they did the same. In
the 4th birth, the parents of Supach were born as Neeru and
Neema. Kabir Sahib told them all that and said that out of that
very love for them, he had come to them and had asked them
to take him to their home. Both were astonished to listen a
small child talking like that.
When Neeru and Neema reached home alongwith
Kabir Sahib, they called in the Qazi and the Pandit for giving
the child a Name. The villagers made a fun of them though
they tried to convince them as to how they had found the
child. Both–the Qazi and the Pandit–were called as they didn’t
know whether the child was a Hindu or a Muslim. Before any
of them could say anything, Kabir Sahib himself said that his
Name is Kabir and that there is no need to give him any other
Name. Kabir means having no physical body. The Qazi said
that the Name Kabir is that of God and so asked Neeru to
kill the child who, according to them, is a Kafir. Obeying the
order, Neeru took the child inside and attacked him with a
dagger. Every time the dagger went across his body but
nothing happened to it. Neeru felt afraid. Kabir Sahib said,
“O Neeru! neither I have mother nor father or sister. I am
never born. My body is not made out of blood and semen.”
From the early childhood, Kabir Sahib began to talk
about ‘Amarlok’. Then, the people asked him who is your
Guru? They said that one couldn’t achieve any spiritual
knowledge without seeking the shelter of a Guru. Kabir Sahib
thought that the people were saying right. But whom should
he take as his Guru? At that time Guru Ramanand was
considered as the greatest authority on knowledge related to


64 Sahib Bandgi
religion and God. But, Ramanand Ji didn’t see or touch any
Harijan. He even talked to them from behind a curtain. He
used to go to the Ganga Ghaat daily to have a bath. Kabir Sahib
disguised himself as a small child and laid himself on the steps
leading to the Ghaat. When Ramanand Ji passed that way, his
wooden shoe struck against its (Kabir Sahib’s) head.
He began to weep. Ramananad Ji kept his hand on his
head and told him it not to weep but to say Ram-Ram. His
necklace also fell round the neck of Kabir Sahib. The latter
applied Tilak on his forehead and made his appearance like
that of his Guru who was a vaishnav. The photo of Kabir Sahib
reflects all this.
He gave the spiritual knowledge to mankind for a
period of 120 years. Before his departure from the world,
he declared that he would depart on the day of Magh Shudha
Ekadasi. In his life time, he had blessed 52 Lac people with
‘Naam’. He chose Maghar as the place of his departure. Why
was it so? This is because at that time it was a common belief
that death at Kashi gave one salvation while death at Magghar
made one reborn as a donkey. He said that he was not
denouncing Kashi. He only wanted to expose the hypocrites.
He said–
Jo Kabira Kashi Marey To Ram Hi Kaun Niharey.
If death at Kashi can give salvation, there is no need of
worshipping Ram.
He removed the misconceptions of the people.
Otherwise, the people at the instance of the hypocrites, used
to embrace death at Kashi. They were of the view that doing
so they would be able to attain salvation. Kabir Sahib wanted


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 65
to remove this wrong misconception and thereby save the
people from getting their neck cut off with a specially
designed machine at the hands of the hypocrites.
The dying persons used to donate money or property
even to the killers. Afterwards, the English Government
banned it. On hearing the news of Kabir Sahib’s arrival at
Maghar, his disciples also reached there. His disciples, Nawab
Bijli Khan Pathan and Raja Bir Singh Baghel, the king of
Kashi, also reached at Maghar alongwith their armies. When
Kabir Sahib lay down in the hut, a sheet of cloth (chadar) was
put on him. Bir Singh Baghel told his army chief that after
the departure of Kabir Sahib, they would cremate his body at
Kashi as per the Hindu rites. Bijli Khan Pathan objected to it
and said that he would perform his last rites as per Islamic
tradition. Moreover, he also said that Kabir Sahib, as per his
desire, spent whole of his life at Kashi and he got blessed
with Naam at that very place but now he had come to Maghar
of his own accord and as such, whose claim was genuine? Bir
Singh Baghel said that there was some logic in what he said
but burying Kabir Sahib like a Muslim would prove harmful.
The Hindus won’t worship and in the method preached by
Kabir Sahib, eating meat is prohibited and the Muslims won’t
be able to act upon it. As such, you should let me perform
the last rites. As none of them was prepared to yield, they
decided to have a fight. The winner was to do so as he desired.
At that very moment there was a miracle. Kabir Sahib wanted
to tell them about his real identity. A loud word was heard
from the sky and with it there appeared a dazzling light.
Uthao Parda Nahin Hai Murda.
Aey Re Moorakh Nadana, Tum Ne Humey Nahin Pehchana.


66 Sahib Bandgi
O fools! you haven’t been able to recognise me. Lift the
cloth and see for yourself. There is no dead body
underneath.
When the cloth was removed, there was no dead body
to be found.
In the presence of lacs of people he performed this
miracle simply to give his message to mankind.
Maa Ka Raj Pita Ka Bindu, Kisko Kehta Turak Aur Hindu.
This body is made out of the blood of mother and semen
of father, so whom do you call as Turak (Muslim) or
Hindu.
Neither I am a Hindu nor a Muslim and have no
mother and father. The Muslims created a mausoleum taking
two flowers out of Sahib’s hut while the Hindus created a
Samadhi taking the other two flowers. All these are still
present in Maghar and are a proof of the fact that Kabir Sahib
didn’t have any physical body and was far away from the fold
of Muslims or the Hindus.
So the aim of Kabir Sahib was to take man on the path
of truth. He talked of the true spiritual element. From his
early childhood, he talked of the ultimate reality. Even today,
the people are doing research work and Ph.D on his sayings.
In England, the scientists are making a research on his
sayings. He has told the distances of the planets and other
universes.
The hypocrites awarded him death punishment for 52
times. These are called as Bawan Kasni. He spent whole of
his life in carrying out tasks for the welfare of mankind.
According to him, the 3 Lok’s are within certain limits and
as long as the soul doesn’t reach its destination, it can’t
achieve eternal peace and pleasures.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 67
There are huge potentials inherent in the human body
but we can’t arouse these without the supporting hand of a
Satguru. Yoga can help us maintain our physical power alone.
It can, in no way, awaken our spiritual powers. Such powers
can be awakened only after getting blessed with Naam from
some perfect Satguru. Kabir Sahib has talked about Sahaj Yog.
This yog will enable you to experience the miraculous powers
within you right on the very day you get blessed with ‘Naam’.
This power will guide you in every way in matters related to
your daily life.
Guru Sahib To Ek Hain, Dooja Sabhi Vikar.
Aapa Taj Ke Guru Bhaje, To Paye Deedar.
Guru and Sahib are one and everything else is useless.
Only a devotee who shuns his ego and worships the
Satguru, can have the vision of Param Purush.
You must be feeling some power with you. This is
called as ‘Naam’. In this Sehaj marg, the devotee begins to
have a clear understanding of mind and the interior world.
Many such nerves give us information about various activities
going on within us, begin to gain activeness. Without the
support of a Satguru, none can achieve the miraculous powers
lying within.
Bulle Shah has said in his sayings–
Na Rab Main Teerthan Deethiya, Na Roza Namaze.
Bulle Shah Nu Murshid Miliya, Andron Rab Lakhaya.
Bulle Shah says that neither visiting of holy places nor
observing of fasts or offering of Namaz (prayer) enabled
him have the vision of God. It was only after getting
blessed with the ‘Holy Naam’ that he was able to have a
vision of Him.
As Kabir Sahib, with appearance of a human body,
descended down on the earth from Amarlok, his Name is also


68 Sahib Bandgi
not related to the body. Some came to the world to save Hindu
religion, some came for the spread of Christianity while
others came to spread Islam but Kabir Sahib came to the
world to preach truth and the means to attain permanent
salvation from the endless cycle of birth and death.
He had to create awakening among the mankind as a
whole. The history bears witness to the fact that blind faith
and fundamentalism have done much harm to man. Today, we
find man killing man. All this can come to an end only when
everyone looks upon every other man as a being having the
same soul. At present, there are about 50 crore devotees of
Kabir Sahib. He didn’t establish any new religion. He only
created awareness among the people regarding the spiritual
knowledge. He told about the real abode of the soul and said
that all the creatures have the same soul. Narrow mindedness
in the field of religion has been created by those who try to
establish their particular religion. This has made the nature
of man cruel and blood thirsty.
I say with full confidence that in the time to come man will
have awareness to understand the value of humanity. He will
rise above the feelings of untouchability and narrow
mindedness. There is much belonging to the past that needs
to be retained and much that needs to be dropped as well.
Noble things of the past combined with the best possible ones
of the present should be our guiding force. Guru Nanak Devji
had two disciples–one, a Muslim (Mardana) and the other, a
Hindu (Bala). He could have easily found 2 Hindus or 2
Muslims but, he did so simply to give a message of unity to
mankind.
Avval Allah Noor Upaya, Kudrat De Sab Bandey.
Ek Noor Se Sab Jag Upja, Kaun Bhaley Kaun Mandey.
Whole of the mankind is the creation of the same God


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 69
and as such, none can be called as good or bad.
Among the disciples of Kabir Sahib, one was Bijli
Khan Pathan, a Muslim while the other was Raja Bir Sing
Baghel, a Hindu. He had to present before the world a picture
of true religion.
Everything that moves, has to perish. Nothing in the 3
lok’s is stable.
Jyon Sapna Aru Pekhna, Aaise Jag Kau Jaan
In Mein Kuch Saacho Nahin, Nanak Bin Bhagwan.
Guru Nanak Dev ji says that we should take the creation
of the world as a dream. It has no element of truth in it.
Param Purush, after churning Himself, created a
spiritually enlightened soul-Sukrit and sent him to the universe
to give relief to the Jivas, who were suffering tortures at the
hands of Kaal Purush, by blessing them with the hidden
‘Naam’.
Blessing Dharam Dass with the hidden ‘Naam’, Kabir
Sahib said, “I have made you enlightened with truth and have
destroyed all your Karmas from the net of Kaal. Be attentive,
attentatively listening to what I say. Perform worship with
concentration. Serve the Sadhus and the dear ones and shun
your ego. Leave aside the thought of family traditions in order
to perform worship in a fearless manner. Don’t worship
anyone else apart from your Guru. He who tries to cheat his
Guru, falls again in the worldly ocean. Never try to hide
anything from your Guru. Keep safe at heart all that the Guru
says and remain away from the worldly Maya and attachments.
Only such a devotee who lives as per the dictates of his Guru,
crosses the worldly ocean easily.”
In all the yugas, Kabir Sahib didn’t ask people to
worship some imaginary being. He categorically asked them


70 Sahib Bandgi
to have full faith in the Guru and worship him alone. He says–
Koti Janam Ka Path Tha, Guru Pal Mein Diya Lakhaye.
The journey of countless births can be covered within a
moment simply by the grace of a Satguru.
The Satguru enables you to sight your real God within
your body. The Rishi-Munies have described the status of a
Guru as being equal to that of God but it was Kabir Sahib who,
first of all, described the status of a Guru as higher than that
of God even. All the saints afterwards described the status
of a Guru in these very terms. Kabir Sahib says–
Guru Hain Badey Govind Se, Mann Mein Dekh Vichaar.
Hari Sumre So Vaar Hai, Guru Sumre So Paar.
Kabira Hari Ke Rooth-Te, Guru Ki Sharni Jaye.
Kahey Kabir Guru Roothte, Hari Na Hoat Sahaye.
The status of a Guru is higher than that of God. The
worship of a Guru and not that of Hari (God) can enable
one cross the worldly ocean. He further says that a
devotee can seek the shelter of a Guru if God gets
offended with him but even God won’t come to his rescue
if, on some account, the Guru gets offended.

```
Ek Rang Mein Jo Rahey Aisa Virla Koye,
Kabira Aisa Virla Koye.
Kabir Sahib says that it is only some rare person who
remain absorbed in one kind of thoughts for the whole
life.

## Kabir Sahib Awakened

## Every Soul

One day, I was listening to the religious discourses
being delivered by a Mahatma of great repute and fame. When
he raised his hand, I saw three rings in his fingers. Perhaps
these were meant to bring the ill-effect of the planets under
control. When the Mahatma himself is afraid of the effect
of the planets, how can he be expected to make his disciples
fearless and bold. But Kabir Sahib has said–
Nav Grahon Ka Vash Nahin Chalei,
Jra Maran Ka Beej Nasayi.
Maaran Maran Samohan Kar,
Mann He Mann Pachhtayi.
When the real power generated by the ‘Naam’ blessed
by the Satguru comes to you, the ill-effect of the planets
won’t cause any harm to you. The very thought of birth
and death will vanish from within you.
Even the effect of evil eyes, black magic etc. won’t
have any effect on you. The power of ‘Naam’ will protect you
like a security guard. The true ‘Naam’ gives pleasures and
comforts not only in this Lok but in the one beyond it as well.
Nanak Dukhiya Sab Sansaar.
So Sukhiya Jis Naam Adhaar.

```
71
```

72 Sahib Bandgi
Guru Nanak Devji says that whole of the world looks
miserable and sad. Only he who has the wealth of ‘Naam’
with him, possesses the real pleasures.
Kabir Sahib has cautioned the devotees about it. He
says–
Paet Ke Kaaran Karey Guruai, Peedi Sahit Narak Mein Jayi.
He who poses himself as a Guru simply to satisfy his
bodily needs, will go to hell alongwith his descendants.
The worldly people are badly entangled in the grip of
such Gurus. Today, lacs of sadhus are blessing the people with
Naam. But, ‘Naam’ is not such a cheap thing. Kabir Sahib says–
Bin Satguru Pavey Nahin, Koi Kotin Karey Upaye.
However hard one may try, one can’t get blessed with
true ‘Naam’ without seeking the shelter of a Satguru.
The Satguru awakens within you the power that is
already there. He has called the divine power itself as ‘Naam’.
Just as redness is already present in Mehndi (henna) but it
doesn’t appear without grounding it into a powder form, oil
is present within the Tils (sesame) but it doesn’t come out
without processing it and ghee is present within milk but it
doesn’t come out without processing it, likewise, the power
is already present within you but it can be experienced only
when some Satguru awakens it with the power of his
concentration. This act is called as the act of blessing with
‘Naam’. This ‘Naam’ will remove the vices and flaws from
within you and will enable you cross the worldly ocean. Our
soul is invisible and this is the reason behind man’s efforts
to realize it. The plain fact is that our soul is in bondage. It
has got absorbed in the five material elements and as a result,
it has been taking itself as the body. But, the fact is that the


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 73
mind and body have held it in bondage. Kabir Sahib has spoken
a lot about the Mind.
Tera Baeri Koi Nahin, Tera Baeri Mann.
Jeev Ke Sang Mann Kaal Rahayi, Agyani Narr Janat Nahin.
He says that none else but your mind is your enemy. The
ignorant man doesn’t know that it is present alongwith
the Soul in the guise of Kaal (Death).
Naturally, such a monstrous power doesn’t let soul
know of its original abode. Kabir Sahib says–
Chal Hansa Satlok, Chhodo Yeh Sansara.
Yeh Sansar Kaal Ka Desha, Karam Ka Jaal Pasara.
O Hansa! let’s leave this world and move to Satlok. This
world belongs to Kaal Purush who has spread the net of
Karmas. It means, this world doesn’t belong to us. All
of us are struggling here for providing one or the other
comfort to the body.
This body is perishable but the soul is unperishable.
Our struggle for the liberation of our soul is not proper. Darya
Sahib says–
Paar Lagan Ko Har Koyi Chahey,
Bin Satguru Koi Thah Na Paye.
Everyone wants to cross the worldly ocean but none can
do so without seeking the shelter of some Satguru.
Kabir Sahib says–
Vastu Kahin Dhundhe Kahin, Kehi Vidhi Aavey Haath.
Kahey Kabir Bhedi Liya, Pal Mein Daet Lakhaat.
If we make a search for a thing at some place other than
the one where it is lying, we can’t succeed in finding it
out. But the support of some true guide in this regard
will enable us find it out within a moment.
The only problem with the worldly people is that the ways


74 Sahib Bandgi
and means adopted by them for the soul realisation are not
right and effective.
Kabir Sahib, in order to create awakening among the
people, made use of simple and easy language.
Mo Ko Kahan Tu Dhundhe Re Bandey,
Main To Tere Pass Mein.
Na Main Japp Mein Na Main Tapp Mein,
Na Main Yog Sanyas Mein.
O man! where are you searching me? I am alongwith
you. Neither I can be realized through worship or
austerity nor through yog or sanyas (renunciation).
Acts of charity, performance of yajyas, visiting of holy
places etc. are not the real means that can help one realise
God. The people are being misled and made to believe that
He resides somewhere outside.
The holy saints have cleared the picture–
Kasturi Kundal Basey, Mrig Khoje Ban Mahin.
Aise Ghat Ghat Saiyan, Moorakh Janat Nahin.
Musk is present within the deer but it makes a search of
it somewhere outside. Likewise, God is present within
every one, but the foolish persons don’t know of it.
Kabir Sahib didn’t awoke any particular caste,
community or race. He awakened every soul. The teachings
of the holy saints are creating awareness in every man. Due
to the misconceptions created by the hypocrites, the spiritual
element has been lost in-between mind and body.
What is the identity of the soul and which is its abode?
Kabir Sahib hasn’t denounced any person or any religious
scripture.
Ko Kahey Ved Ko Jhootha, Vo Jhootha Jo Ved Na Vichara.
Who can call the Vedas as unreal? In fact, he who doesn’t
think over the contents of the Vedas, is a liar.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 75
He simply pointed out the limit to which each mode
of worship can take us. He tells us about that country.
Santo So Nij Desh Hamara.
Jahan Jaye Phir Hans Na Aaye, Bhav Sagar Ki Dhara.
O saints! I have come from the Loka wherefrom the
Hansas don’t return back to the worldly ocean of Kaal
Niranjan.
There is no mention of any such thing in Sargun as
well as Nirgun kinds of worship. These only speak about
rebirth. It is true that one can attain any of the four kinds of
salvation by following these modes of worship but these
salvations are not of permanent nature and the Soul will have
to come back to the world again. On the other hand, there is
nothing like rebirth for those who follow the mode of
worship preached by Kabir Sahib. About the real abode of
soul, he says–
Surya Chandr Nahin Tahan Prakashat,
Nahin Nav Mandal Tara.
There are neither sun or moon nor any solar
system, stars, planets etc.
Uday Ast Divas Nahin Rajni.
There are no days and nights.
Paanch Tattav Gun Teen Tahan Nahin,
Nahin Tahan Srishti Pasara.
Even the five elements and the world created out of these
are not to be found there.
This is because wherever there are five elements there
is dissolution. There is no contradiction in his sayings. In the
same simple and straightforward way he has talked about the
4th Lok.
Teen Lok Parlay Tar Aai, Chautha Lok Amar Hai Bhai.
There is dissolution up to 3 Lok’s whereas the 4th Lok
is beyond any dissolution.


76 Sahib Bandgi
He says that nothing like hunger, thirst, birth, death,
mind, colour etc. is to be found there. Everything like colour,
taste, hunger, thirst, indriyas etc. including the body itself,
owe their existence to the five elements. All the relations we
find in the world are related to the physical body alone. Since
there are no physical bodies and indriyas in Amarlok, there
is nothing like these worldly relations. In fact, the attainment
of physical body is, in itself, a great painful thing.
In Amarlok, there are no diseases, winter, summer,
desires, distinctions between high and low, males, females,
Brahmans, Kshatriyas etc.
As there is no Mind, there is nothing like sin or noble
deeds etc., that are directly related to Mind, to be found there.
Fulfillment of some desire brings joy to mind while its non-
fulfillment makes it sad. As there is no mind to be found
there, the joys and sorrows also are non-existent there. The
soul has nothing to do with these.
The spiritual element is not visible as it is not made
of the 5 material elements. All that we see in man is the
activities related to body and mind. None can say anything
about the appearance of soul.
All the 3 Lok’s are expanding and they are bound to
perish in a likewise manner. But, no expansion in Amarlok
takes place. As such, it is unperishable. Probably, our
ancestors had made a search of this universe and the interior
world. In the beginning, man must have felt tired after his
failure to know about God. That is why some began to take
the five elements themselves as God. Afterwards, man must
have fixed his concentration within his body. He seems to
have fixed his concentration at five places within his body.
These are the five postures that have been mentioned in the


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 77
Vedas, the Puranas and the Shastras. Kabir Sahib has explained
the limits up to which man could reach with the help of these
five Mudras (Khechri, Bhuchri, Chachri, Unmuni and
Agochari). Anyone of you can make use of these Mudras and
gain the particular experiences related to each of them.
Kabir Sahib says that the five elements have been
produced by the utterance of five words. He has called the
Dhuns (musical notes) that one hears from within, as
perishable. But, it sounds very strange when we find the
modern sages reciting the sayings of Kabir Sahib but still
taking these Dhuns (jinglement of words) as God.
Do Bin Hoye Na Adhar Avaja.
There can be no sound without the presence of 2 things.
The sound is produced only when two things strike with
each other.
The worldly people die after taking birth but Satguru
has revealed to me the secret regarding dying even while
living. Kabir Sahib says–
Martey Martey, Jag Mua, Maran Na Jana Koye.
Aisi Marni Na Mara, Jo Bahur Na Marna Hoye.
Worldly people are seen dying but none knows the real
state of dying. The real death implies not to suffer death
again and again.
All the four kinds of salvation are related to the 3
Lok’s and are, hence, of short duration only.
The ideology of Kabir Sahib is scientific and is based
on logic but the worldly people use it as per their vested
interests.
In Shastras like Yog Vashishath, one can find a mention
of the interior body. A devotee can see many universes within
him. For such a devotee, the worldly people will appear like


78 Sahib Bandgi
ignorants. Just as an educated man considers the uneducated
ones as fools, the educated ones appear as ignorant to one
who has with him the experiences related to the inner world.
Kabir Sahib has said–
Santo Ye Jag Baurana.
Saach Kaho To Maaran Dhaye, Jhoothe Jag Patiana.
O saints! this universe is an abode of fools. If someone
speaks the truth, they run to attack him.
Kisko Samjhaun Sab Jag Andha.
Whom should he admonish when all the people
are blind of the inner eyes.
Fixing of concentration at the 10th aperture is not a
child’s play. But he has said that even such a devotee must be
considered as an imperfect one. To become a perfect devotee,
one has to move beyond all this.
R-Rankar Khechri Mudra, Dusvan Dwaar Thikana.
Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh Aadi Ne, R-Rankar Ko Jana.
Reciting the word R-Rankar and making use of the
khechri mudra, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh and others
could move out of the 10th aperture.
Paanch Shabd Aur Paanchon Mudra,
Soyi Nishchay Kar Mana.
Us Ke Aage Purush Puratan,
Tiski Khabar Na Jana.
Those who remained within the limits of 5 words and 5
mudras, couldn’t have any knowledge of Param Purush
whose abode is far away from all these.
Just as continuous study enables one have some
knowledge of the depth, the continuous attending of satsangs
enables a devotee have a deep knowledge of the inner world.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 79
Kabir Sahib says that all the sages, Tridevas etc.
remained entangled within the limit of 5 words. Even after
practising the Mudras, they had, once again, to take birth. He
says that levelling charges against someone is just like an act
of denouncing but telling someone the crime he has
committed, can not be called as an act of denunciation. He
has spoken a lot about the high status and glory of a Guru.
He says–
Guru Paaras Guru Paras Hai, Guru Amrit Ki Khaan.
Sheesh Diye Jo Guru Miley, To Bhi Sasta jaan.
A Guru is an unending source of nectar. Just as a Paaras
stone has the property of changing iron into gold, the
Satguru has the power to change the disciple like his
ownself. The bargain is very profiting if one seeks the
shelter of some Satguru even at the cost of one’s ego.
He also says that just as there is a Mason as well as a
head mason, there is a Guru as well as a Satguru. A Guru can
tell you the way to awake the powers hidden within you. On
the other hand, a Satguru can produce such powers within you.
The enemies within are so powerful that even after the
opening of the 10th aperture awake, one can’t cross the limit
of Maya (illusion). As a Satguru has the power to awake the
rare power at the very time of blessing with ‘Naam’, he has
been called as an ocean of Surti. None but, a Satguru can awake
the spiritual power lying hidden within you within a moment.
With the awakening of this power, you will be able to know
all the vices and enemies. Remaining in the company of a
Satguru means remaining in a huge ocean of light. Fixing
concentration at him ensures the regular supply of such powers.
Why does a child call out to its mother? This is
because he knows that his sound will reach her. Why does a


80 Sahib Bandgi
man calls out to God at the time of misforture? This is
because he knows that somehow or other his sound will reach
Him and He will come to his rescue. It also shows that your
soul, knowingly or unknowingly, has the knowledge about the
spiritual power.
It is in the light of above that the holy saints have
accorded the Satguru a status higher than that of God even.
I asked a doctor how long does a child remain in the
womb of the mother. He replied that normally a child remains
there for 9 months but some children take birth after 7 or 8
months as well. But, the fact is that a girl takes more time
than a male child. Kabir Sahib hasn’t described 9 months as
the period for the birth of a child. He says–
Nau Dus Maah Bunan Ko Lagey.
It took about 9-10 months for the child to
develop in the womb of his mother.
He has used only clear cut and meaningful words. The
people often make use of meaningless words like roti-soti.
Roti means food but what do they mean by the word ‘Soti’?
Kabir Sahib and other saints have never used any purposeless
words. Kabir Sahib says–
Guru Milne Se Jhagda Khatam Ho Gaya.
After seeking the shelter of a Guru, there
remains no misconception related to the
spiritual knowledge.
This is because the flow of spiritual power
automatically begins to take place. A disciple came to me and
said, “Our business is not running well. People say that this
is the result of severing ties with gods and the goddesses.
What has your Guru ji given to you?” sometimes, people feel
perturbed even by the ailments of one kind or the other. This


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 81
is nothing but an act of ignorance. Now your sorrows and
pleasures have become that of your Guru. So you needn’t
worry about these. This body is made of 5 material elements
and sufferings and problems of one kind or the other are
bound to appear. Always ask for spiritual powers from your
Satguru instead of asking for comforts and pleasures.
Remember! both sorrows and pleasures are important for a
real happy life.
There are certain nerves in our body that become
active only at the time of some misfortune. All of us pray to
God to save us from sufferings and sorrows. We want peace
and pleasures only. In such a state, who would like to depart
from the world.
Sukh Mein Tujhe Na Bhoolun, Dukh Mein Haar Na Maanun.
O Sahib! I would never like to forget you in the time of
comfort and joy and would face the sorrows and
sufferings boldly and courageously.
This is what you should ask from God. You should ask
your Satguru to give you the power to stick to the path shown
by him.
I would like to cite an instance of Socrates. He was
awarded death punishment. He was not a dacoit or a murderer.
He was simply speaking that which appeared to him to be
true. The judges felt that the punishment given to him by the
king, under the pressure of the persons at the helms of
religious affairs, was a very cruel one as he hadn’t committed
any crime against anyone. They said that they would pardon
him if he agreed to leave Athens for some other place.
Socrates asked if he would become immortal then. The judges
said that he would have to meet death one day or the other.


82 Sahib Bandgi
Socrates said that if death was certain, it was meaningless to
think when it comes. He refused to flee like a coward.
The judges again thought a way out. They told him that
he would remain in Athens and could escape death punishment
if he agreed to stop preaching his views. Socrates replied that
that was a somewhat more difficult problem than that of
leaving Athens. He had to speak all that was true as God had
sent him to the earth to preach the truth and that if he didn’t
do so, he would be taken as a defaulter in the court of God.
So, Socrates preferred to die than to refrain from speaking
the truth.

Paltoo ji says that everything including liberation can
be achieved through satsang alone. Without satsang a
devotee can’t achieve the higher targets of life.

## Whole Of The World

## Has Been Lost In The

## Waves Of Mind

Regarding mind, Kabir Sahib says–
Mann Hi Saroopi Dev Niranjan, Tohi Raakh Bharmayi.
Hey Hansa Tu Amarlok Ka, Padda Kaal Bus Aayi.
This mind itself is Niranjan. O Hansa! you belong to
Amarlok but have fallen in the hands of Kaal.
One thing that one finds in all the human beings is the
desire to have a union with God. As the soul is a part of God,
so it wants to attain God. In fact, everything moves around
the one of which it is a part. Our earth, being a part of the
sun, has been revolving around it. The fire is a part of the sun,
so it moves upward towards it. The water, being a part of the
ocean, ultimately flows down to it.
But the soul has been held in a powerful bondage so
as to prevent it from reaching its original abode. Nothing in
this material world is of any use to the soul. But, being a part
of God, it must be in possession of God-like powers. Kabir
Sahib says–
Hansa Tu To Sabal Tha, Atpat Teri Chaal.
Rang Kurang Te Rang Liya, Ab Kyun Phirat Behaal.
O Hansa! you were strong and your movements were of

```

```

84 Sahib Bandgi
rare kind. You have added worldly dirt and filth to
yourself and have now been wandering like one who is
in distress.
This soul has fallen in the hands of clever and devil
forces and its powers have got subdued. But these haven’t died
out. This mind is a great enemy of the soul. The vices like
lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego, alongwith 25 natures
related to the 5 elements like air, water, fire etc., are the
powers of mind and are called as Maya. This Mind has an
unlimited manifestation. Kabir Sahib has cautioned us against
it.
Mann Jeev Ko Bharmave Soyi, Mann Ka Kaha Na Keejai Koyi.
Mann Hi Aaey Kaal Karala, Jeev Nachaye Karey Behala.
None should obey the Mind as it misleads Jiva
continuously. This Mind itself is Kaal that tortures the
Jiva.
Tera Baeri Koi Nahin, Tera Baeri Mann.
He further says that none else but, your mind is your
enemy.
All the activities being performed by mind are totally
unrelated to the soul.
Mann He Niranjan Mann He Onkaar Mann He Hai Kartara.
Mind itself is Niranjan, Onkaar and the Doer.
It is so powerful that it can take the soul in any
direction it likes. It makes it dance to its tune in a manner a
juggler makes the monkey dance to his tune.
Every body in this universe has been living a life devoid of
spiritualism. Man takes the physical body as a reality. Further,
this body has 25 kinds of nature. Hunger, thirst, laziness, sleep
and yawning reflect the nature of fire. The bones, muscles,
skin, pores and nerves reflect the nature of the earth.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 85
Contraction, expansion, hearing, speaking and applying force
reflect the nature of air. The word, appearance, juice, smell
and touch reflect the nature of the sky whereas blood,
perspiration, spittle, urine and semen reflect the nature of
water. All of us have these 25 kinds of nature. Moreover, man
has five Karam Indriyas and five Gyan Indriyas. Everyone is
living a life without knowing that this body is perishable.
Yeh Pinjra Nahin Tera Hansa, Yeh Pinjra Nahin Tera.
O Hansa! this bodily cage doesn’t belong to you.
This body is born out of lustful activities, is full of
lustful thoughts and has 10 apertures. Many enemies are
residing within it. The soul has nothing to do with all this.
The job of smelling has to be performed by nose. The ears
can’t do so. Act of hearing is performed by ears. Our mouth
can’t do so. The act of chewing food is done by the teeth.
No other organ can do it. Likewise, all the pleasures and the
things we enjoy are related to the body, not to the soul. Then
why is our soul turning to such pleasures. The soul is a source
of unending pleasures and as such, needs no support. Its
unique property lies in its being eternal. When all the things
made out of the five material elements are perishable, why
has man been engaged in making a search of God in these
things?
Kasturi Kundal Basey, Mrigh Dhoonde Ban Mahin.
Aise Ghat Ghat Saiyan, Moorakh Janat Nahin.
The musk is present within the body of a deer but it
makes a search of it in the forest. Likewise, God is
present in every human body but the fools don’t have a
knowledge of it.
The greatest wonder in the spiritual world is that the
soul has been taking the sorrows and pleasures related to the


86 Sahib Bandgi
body as its own ones though it is totally unrelated to these.
Man hasn’t been able to know the secrets hidden within this
human body.
Shiv Gorakh So Pach Pach Haare.
Kaya Ka Koi Bheid Na Paye.
Even, Shiv and Gorakh Nath failed to know the secrets
related to the body.
In such circumstances, how can common man know
about these.
Santon Ghar Mein Jhagda Bhari.
Kabir Sahib says that a lot of troubles and
conflicts are to be found within this body.
All sorts of plays are being enacted there. If the soul
has no role in all these, which is the power at whose directions
all this is happening.
Ek Na Bhoola, Doyi Na Bhoola, Jo Hai Snatan Sohi Bhoola.
He says that not only 1 or 2 persons but the whole of
mankind seems to have got misled.
Kahey Kabir Kis Ko Samjhaun, Sab Jag Andha.
Sab Ko Laga Hai, Pituva Ka Dhanda.
He says whom should he make the idea clear. All are
engaged in providing all sorts of comforts to the body.
Ja Se Kahiye Bheid Ko, So Narr Baeri Hoye.
After all, why is it so that anybody whom he tries to
explain the truth about God, turns hostile.
The rival and opposing forces within have marred the
thinking power of all. That is why all are leading the same
kind of life.
There is need to think as to why the vices like lust,
anger, greed, attachment and ego are to be found in all. For
the comforts of the body, Man has been adopting all sorts of


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 87
evil acts like that of forgery, cheating, violence etc. but it is
the soul that is providing the needed energy for all such acts.
It is on account of the misguidance of Mind that the soul has
been taking itself as a body. In fact, the Mind is all powerful.
It is full of negative power. Man can never hope to attain real
peace as long as his soul is under the control of Mind. The
Shastras and the Puranas describe different measures to
control mind but these have less utility.
We read the stories about Parashar Rishi, Inder and
others who were overpowered by mind and its evil forces.
Mind has four different appearances. These are–mind,
intellect, remembrance and action. Water has 3 states–solid,
liquid and gas. All these states have the same element.
There is a difference of form only. Likewise, when the
Mind makes a desire, it is called as Mind. When it makes a
planning for the fulfillment of the desire, it is called as
intellect. When it remembers something, it is called as
remembrance and when it actually performs the job, it is
called as action. None of these four forms works for the
welfare of the soul. Mind never shows a desire to have a
union with God. All its desires are related to the soul. The
intellect also doesn’t make a planning for the liberation of
the soul. It will turn your attention towards the material
objects of the world that can bring material wealth. All its
activities mislead man in one way or the other. These are
concerned with finding the ways and means that can give more
and more comforts to the body. So this intellect as well, is
our enemy. You will feel confused at what I am saying because
all of us believe that intellect is helpful for man.
Kabir Sahib has cautioned–


88 Sahib Bandgi
Paap Punya Ye Donon Beddi, Ik Loha Ik Kanchan Kaeri.
Both, sin as well as noble deeds are a sort of bondage.
While one is that of iron, the other one is that of gold.
The noble deeds performed at the instance of intellect
are a cause of bondage. It is not within the power of man to
understand the different tasks being performed by the
different states of mind. The possession of material wealth
has made man egotist. Kabir Sahib says–
Kya Hua Vedon Ko Padne Se, Jo Na Jana Bheid Ko.
Aatma Janey Bina Koi, Gyani Kehlata Nahin.
The study of the Vedas is useless if we fail to know the
secret that without soul realisation none can be called
as a spiritually enlightened fellow.
The 3rd state of mind is called as Remembrance
(memory). It is no less dangerous than the first two. Whenever
you sit in meditation, it will remind you of one or the other
happening and will thus create hurdles. It is not easy to get
control over mind. Lord Krishan also said to Arjun, “It is
difficult to control mind. To attain the target of life, you will
have to fix your concentration at a place in-between the eye
brows. The knowledge of love and truth alone is not going to
pay.” Arjun said, “Please don’t ask me to make efforts to
control my mind. Though it is impossible to tie the air into a
knot, to churn the ocean and to pierce the sky, yet I can make
an attempt in this regard. This mind doesn’t remain stable at
any moment. As such, I don’t want to make an attempt even
in this regard.”
My disciples also say, “O Gurudev! the mind deosn’t
remain stable. It wanders about.” This mind from within acts
as per its own desires.
Kabir Sahib has rightly said–


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 89
Mann Mureed Sansaar Hai, Guru Mureed Koi Ek.
Mann Par Jo Asvar Hai, Aisa Birla Koi.
Kabira Aisa Birla Koi.
Whole of the world is a devotee of mind whereas there
is some rare one who is a devotee of Guru. There is some
rare fellow, indeed, who makes the mind act as per his
desires.
Everyone wants to fix his concentration. What is
concentration? Even those who fix concentration don’t know
why they are doing so. Likewise, the people hold satsangs but
none pays any heed to the purpose that these satsangs fulfil.
Kabir Sahib has suggested an easy way for recitation–
Mann Ki Tarang Maar De, Bas Ho Gaya Bhajan.
Aadat Buri Sudhar Le, To Ho Gaya Bhajan.
Aaya Hai Tu Kahan Se, Aur Jana Hai Kahan.
Itna Sa Bas Vichar Le, To Ho Gaya Bhajan.
Worship lies in ignoring the waves of mind, in mending
bad habits and in knowing wherefrom one has come and
where one has to go.
It means, simply ignoring the dictates of Mind,
intellect, memory and action is the real form of worship.
Apart from all this, all that remains behind is concentration
or the spiritual element. If you try to control your mind, the
intellect will become active. If you try to control your
intellect, your memory will begin to play its role and will
present before you such incidents or things which are of no
avail to you. These can only arise feelings of hatred within
you. So these unique actors within you will waste your
precious time and will foil your desire to sit in meditation.
Kitne Tapsi Tapp Kar Darey, Kaya Dari Gara.
Grah Chhod Bhaye Sanyasi, Koi Na Pavat Para.


90 Sahib Bandgi
Kabir Sahib says that many worshippers worshipped
hard and even turned their bodies into skeletons while
many others renounced their homes and took Sanyas.
But, strange to say, that none could succeed in crossing
the worldly ocean of birth and death.
Your Surat as well as Nirat (the two forms of soul)
are providing the needed energy to the activities of mind. It
is in this context that the holy saints say that your soul has
taken itself as the body and has been associating itself in all
its activities. Like Sheikh Chilli, this mind will begin to make
schemes for the fulfillment of tasks that have to be
performed at some later stage. If you have to marry your
daughter, it will keep you entangled in devising the ways and
means to procure money and to collect all the needed
material for the purpose.
Kabir Sahib is amazed at this thinking of the worldly
people. He says–
Panv Palak Ki Sudh Nahin, Karey Kalp Ki Aas.
Pani Manhi Ghar Kiya, So Kas Marey Pyas.
None knows what will happen the next moment but still
the mind keeps us busy with the desires related to future.
Living in water and dying of thirst carries no sense in
it.
Some are emotional and get swayed along the waves
of mind. There is a great need to think over the activities of
mind. There is none to be found who turns inward and watches
the different departments being run by the mind.
Many people, after returning from the satsangs of
some sages, indulge in their usual acts of forgery, cheating
etc. There is no virtue of soul to be seen in them. At a
Bhandara, organised in an Ashram of Bhopal on the eve of


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 91
the auspicious day of incarnation of Kabir Sahib, some press
reporters asked me many questions. One said, “Maharaj!
wherever we see, we find the yajyas, satsangs etc. being
organised. Even through the medium of T.V, live programmes
related to worship are being telecast. Many religious books
and articles etc. are also being published. More and more
places of worship meet our eyes. There appears to be a sort
of new movement in the field of worship. But, still the people
seem to be devoid of any virtue related to worship. What is
the reason thereof?”
I told him that he had asked a very good question. This
is the main topic on which I often speak. At present, three
kinds of people seem to have infiltrated in the field of
worship. The first kind of people belong to the category are
the culprits; the second kind of people are those who have
adopted religion as a means of amassing wealth while the
politicians are the 3rd kind of people. All of them have
polluted the entire religious atmosphere. The culprits have
found a shelter in this field. If people see a stranger in some
village, they will cast a doubt on his identity. If one moves in
the dress of a sage, none will be there to cast a doubt.
Next, those who have taken it as a profession, possess
huge wealth. They enjoy the facilities that surpass even those
enjoyed by the prime minister or some other
multimillionaire. Their life-style is also altogether different
from that of the real sages. Kabir Sahib spent whole of his
life in a simple cottage though he had among his disciples,
Bir Singh Baghel, the king of Kashi and Nawab Bijli Khan
Pathan, the ruler of Avadh. In Banaras, his cottage was even
burnt down. There was only one reason behind it. There was
a grand building of a prostitute near the cottage of Kabir Sahib.


92 Sahib Bandgi
She was a very beautiful lady. Many kings, rich and influential
men used to come to her. The commander-in-chief of Kashi
was also fascinated towards her. He asked her if she had any
problem. She said, “I have to face a problem. When, after
entertaining all of you, I go to sleep, at that very time, Kabir
begins to sing Bhajans (devotional songs) in the glory of
God.” Normally, the prostitutes don’t find time to sleep at
night and have nothing to do with the worship of God whereas
the saints and the sages wake up early in the morning and get
engaged in their normal worship of God. Many sages used to
come to Kabir Sahib to have religious discourses with him
and to sing bhajans in the glory of God. She also said that
she had repeatedly requested him to refrain from creating
noise at night as it caused disturbance in her sleep but he
didn’t care for it. The commander-in-chief asked her not to
worry and assured her that the cottage of Kabir would be no
more there tomorrow. He ordered some strong fellows to
burn down the cottage of Kabir. They came and set fire to
the cottage. Kabir Sahib came out and congratulated them for
their courageous task. As per God’s will, a big cinder entered
into the palace-like building of the prostitute through a
window with the force of wind. It fell on a velvet cushion. It
caught fire at once and the fire spread in the whole of palace.
Everything, including the precious stones and jewellery were
burnt to ashes. There were no fire brigades like the modern
times that could come forward to extinguish the fire.
The prostitute came out running and catching hold of
Kabir Sahib said that he had burnt down her palace. Kabir
Sahib said, “O fool! listen to me. What are you worrying
about? It is the quarrel between our beloved and not between
you and me. Your beloved burnt down my cottage for your


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 93
sake. My beloved who loves me a lot, couldn’t tolerate it and
he burnt down your palace. When the fight is between our
beloveds why should we fight with each other. Let’s enjoy the
fight between them.”
So, such a simple was the life-style of the holy saints.
Today, you can’t even talk to the sages. They move in the
company of armed gun-men. Once a man came to me for
getting blessed with Naam. I asked him to first attend some
satsangs so that he might be able to assay well.
Pani Peejai Chhan Ke, Guru Keejai Jaan Ke.
It is wise to drink well filtered water and to seek the
shelter of a Guru after assaying him well.
He said, “Maharaj! I have done that. I want to seek
shelter at your holy feet.” I asked him how he had assayed.
He said, “First I went to a great sage. I remained there for
10-15 days. He is a very famous sage. 10-15 armed gun-men
guard him at all the times. I thought, if he is afraid of his own
life, how will he protect us?”
These days, many religious institutions are registered
ones but the sages are lavishly spending the money for their
own comforts.
Guru Nanak Dev ji lived a hard life. He was a great
saint. He visited Baghdad, Macca, Madina and many other
places but didn’t get his own house constructed. He had two
sons–Baba Shrichand and Baba Lakshmi Chand. He was
impartial and so didn’t nominate any of them as his successor.
It was Bhai Lehna ji, his disciple, whom he chose as his
successor.
Kabir Sahib has said–
Kabir Kalyug Aa Gaya, Sant Na Pooje Koye.
Kaami Krodhi Lalchi, Inki Pooja Hoye.


94 Sahib Bandgi
He says that Kalyug has made its appearance. Instead of
worshipping the saints, the people worship such sages
who have the vices like lust, anger and attachment.
Like the politicians, the modern sages as well have
begun to nominate one of their own family members as the
next successor. Even his photos begin to find a place
alongwith that of Guruji. This is done to give a clear message
to the devotees regarding the would-be Guruji.
Kabir Sahib says–
Andhey Ko Andha Miley, To Raah Bataey Kaun.
Bandhey Ko Bandha Miley, To Ganth Chhudavey Kaun.
Just as a blind man can’t be expected to show the path
to some other blind man, a Guru who himself is held in
one or the other kind of bondage, can’t be expected to
free his disciples from their bondages.
Kabir Sahib hadn’t married. He had no wife. ‘Loyi’
wasn’t his wife. He called worship as Loyi. Kamaal was not
his son. A dead body of some youth was floating down a river.
Sheikh Takki, the Guru of Sikander Lodhi, wanted to test the
spiritual power of Kabir Sahib. He had asked him to make the
dead body alive if he considered himself as a true worshipper
of God. Kabir Sahib had said, “Utth kudrat ke kamaal se (get
up by the miraculous power of Sahib).” The dead body had
become alive. Sheikh Takki, in utter surprise, had said,
“Kamaal hai (it is a wonder).” Sahib had named the youth as
Kamaal. He remained with Kabir Sahib for the rest of his life
but, before departing from the world, Kabir Sahib nominated
Dharam Dass ji as his successor to Guru Gaddi (seat of a
Guru).
The holy saints had full control over the vices like lust,
anger, greed, attachment and ego. Ravi Dass ji was a great saint.
He made two pairs of shoes daily. He gave one in charity and


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 95
lived on the earnings by selling the other one. Though, among
his disciples were great men like the king Peepa and Meera
Bai, yet he lived on his own earnings. He is still honoured as
a great saint all over India.
Saint Tuka Ram lived on the earnings he made by
selling woods. Though he had among his disciples such great
men as Chhatar Pati Shivaji, yet he didn’t give up his simple
and saint like life-style. The present saints seem to be more
interested in amassing wealth and in living luxurious lives.
Then the fellow who had come to me for getting
blessed with Naam, said, “I went to another place for getting
blessed with Naam. I found 3 kinds of categories there. There
were special arrangements for the rich and for those
belonging to the middle class but there was no such
arrangement for the simple and normal fellows. I stayed there
for 15-20 days and then came back. When I reached here, I
watched your activities for 15-20 days. I found in you the
glimpse of a fearless and courageous man. Moreover, there
is no special arrangement for anyone. All are treated alike.”
All I mean to say is that the religious atmosphere has
got polluted. Distinctions on one or the other basis have
surfaced everywhere. The real sages judge a person from the
degree of devotion and faith one has for worship.
The 3rd vice that has crept into the field of worship
is the entry of politicians. This is because they are concerned
with votes. As a result, a deep love has developed between
the politicians and the modern sages. Both speak from the
same stage and often one finds it difficult to judge as to
whether the sage is a politician or the politician is a sage.
Both of them gain from the support of each other. While the
politicians gain the support of lacs of followers of Mahatmaji,
the latter gets land worth crores and crores of rupees as
charity. All this has spoiled the charm of worship in society


96 Sahib Bandgi
and has prevented the people from knowing the real mode of
worship.
I was talking about the waves of mind. Kabir Sahib
says–
Tera Baeri Koi Nahin, Tera Baeri Mann.
None else but, your mind is your enemy.
There is a need to be alert from the evil designs of
Mind as it doesn’t leave you alone for a moment even. We
ourselves have given a long rope to the mind and are dancing
to its tune. Instead of trying to understand it, we have taken
it as the light of learning.
It is not the speech or way of talking alone that can help us
know whether a person is good or bad. Instead, it is the
degree of control over the vices like lust, anger, greed etc.
that determine the extent to which a person can be called as
good. The more a person has control over his nature, organs
and mind, the nobler he will be.
There are two states of mind–the gross as well as the subtle.
The organs represent the gross state. A man with less control
over his organs should be taken as one having an unstable
mind. There are definite measures to judge the mind. Try to
watch it without getting swayed alongwith its waves. If you
find yourself swaying alongwith these waves, you should try
to control your Chakshu (eyes) organs.
Sundar Roop Chakshu Ki Pooja.
The beautiful objects are, so to say, the food for
the eyes.
If the eyes move again and again in search of beautiful
things, you should know that the mind is making you do so.
Search to, for beautiful things is the food for eyes. If
a person has no control over his mind in gross state, take it
for granted, that he can’t have any control in the subtle state
as well.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 97
It is the organs that determine whether a person has
control over his mind or not. If someone says his mind
became pure after hearing some religious discourse or after
taking a bath in some holy water, he is not right in saying so.
If some dips in some water can make the mind pure, how can
those living at such places, perform acts of forgery, cheating
etc. All this shows that the mind is not a thing to be brought
under control so easily. There are two aspects related to the
teachings of Kabir Sahib. One is related to the material world
while the other is related to spiritualism. In the sphere of
material world, he cautioned the people about the ways man
is misleading others for his own selfish motives. About 600
years back, Kabir Sahib openly exposed the acts of hypocrisy
and blind devotion in the field of religion. He did it in such a
forceful manner as none would dare to do in the modern times
even.
In those times, there were no courts to give justice.
If the king ordered for the execution of someone, the fellow
had to be hanged. You will be surprised to know that Kabir
Sahib was awarded with death punishment for 52 times. These
are called as Bawan Kasni (severe trials/attempts to kill) or
Bawan Zanjeer. Every time the attempt failed, as his body was
not made of the 5 material elements. Moreover, he had been
created by Param Purush Himself after churning His ownself.
Kabir Sahib revealed the secrets related to the inner world.
A coal can’t be turned white even after washing it with a large
quantity of soap. None would believe if someone claims to
have done so. Likewise, we would never believe if some
devotee makes a claim of having turned the mind pure.
Mann Par Jo Aswaar Hai, Aisa Birla Koye.
Kabira Aisa Birla Koye.
Kabir Sahib says that only some rare fellow can
succeed in bringing the mind under control.


98 Sahib Bandgi
Whenever two wrestlers fight, they try to control each
other’s arms first. Likewise, the indriyas (senses) and the
vices like sex, anger, greed, attachment and ego are the arms
of mind. It uses its power and tactics through these arms. First
of all, the devotees should see whether the Guru whose
shelter they want to seek, has control over his mind or not.
You will find the worldly people engaged in the worship of
Mind. The indriyas are the gross form of this Mind. If these
remain under control, Mind will also remain under control.
This is because mind receives the energy from the soul itself.
You should love your children but should neither
frighten them. Don’t obey them as their intellect takes time
to develop to the needed extent.
As such, they aren’t in a position to take the right
decisions. With love and proper care, you should cultivate
among your children the habit of obeying you. Likewise, you
shouldn’t obey your mind. Anyone who is a slave to mind,
can’t be considered as good.
Ik Aape Ko Daar Tu, To Preet Karey Sab Koye.
Kabir Sahib says that everyone will love a fellow who
shuns his ego.
There are countless micro-organisms in the
environment. There are 9 lac kinds of species in water. Out
of these, 1 to 2 lac can be seen with the open eyes while the
remaining ones remain invisible. Likewise, none can see the
Mind. It is very difficult to have some knowledge about it.
You can understand it only when a Satguru shows you the path.
The gross organs of mind like the eyes, mouth, nose, ears,
hands etc., are misleading the soul. All of these together have
held the soul in bondage. Your egotist-like feelings of being
a post-graduate, a doctor etc. are nothing but a deception.
These have nothing to do with your soul. Likewise, you are
making every possible effort to fulfill its desires. You sleep,


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 99
you wake up, you eat and you do all such like acts as per the
dictates of Mind. Willingly or unwillingly, it makes you do
that what it likes.
Stories from Puranas tell us how this Mind spoiled
the worships of thousands of years of the Rishi-Munies by
arousing in them anger or lust. The rishi Parashar worshipped
for many years but being swayed by the feelings of lust, raped
the daughter of a sailor. Devraj Inder earned the status of a
king of the gods but molested Ahalya, the wife of Gautam
Rishi. Durvasa Rishi, the Guru of Lord Krishan, hurled a curse
on 56 koti Yadavs in a fit of anger. Kapil Muni, in a fit of
anger, turned the 60 thousand sons of the king Saggar into
stones by hurling a curse on them. Bhagirath had to worship
hard for their salvation. All the devotees listen to these stories
with great enthusiasm but none tries to go deep to know the
fruit of such a kind of worship.
Salvation means to escape from the grip of lust, anger,
greed, attachment and ego that are our powerful enemies.
Offering some coins to God or bowing before his idol are
not going to pay. We are not against it. Doing so is better than
doing no kind of worship. We simply want to say that it is
not easy to control such a great enemy (Mind).
Naam Hoye To Maath Navaye,
Nahin To Ye Jag Baandh Nachaye.
It will bow only before a devotee who has got blessed
with ‘Naam’ while it will make all others dance to its
tune.

## Only Some Rare Devotee

## Can Get Blessed With

## The Bodiless Naam

In the present times the practice of blessing the
devotees with Naam is in vogue. The people seem to be
attracted to it. After all, what sort of a ‘Naam’ it is!
Our holy Shastras and even the Ramayana say–
Kali Mein Kewal Naam Adhara.
Sumar Sumar Bhav Utro Para.
In Kalyug, it is only the Naam that has the power to take
one across the worldly ocean.
Guru Nanak ji also says–
Nanak Naam Jahaj Hai, Jo Chadde So Utre Paar.
‘Naam’ is like a ship that can take the devotees across
the worldly ocean of birth and death.
Kabir Sahib says–
Bhav Sagar Ka Paar, Naam Bina Pavey Nahin.
Koi Kotin Karey Upaye.
Even crores of techniques can’t enable a devotee
to cross the worldly ocean. He can do so only if
he gets blessed with ‘Naam’.
But, he makes the people cautious about this bodiless
Naam–
Kaya Naam Sabhi Gauhrawey.
Videh Naam Koi Birla Pavey.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 101
Jab Lag Saar Naam Na Paye.
Tab Lag Jeev Bhav Bhatka Khaye.
All are talking about the Naam related to the body but
it is some rare fellow who gets blessed with the bodiless
Naam. Without getting blessed with the real bodiless
Naam, Soul can’t cross the worldly ocean.
Akaeh Naam Jo Kaha Na Jayi, Likha Na Jayi, Padda Na Jayi.
Bin Satguru Koi Naahin Payi.
The real bodiless Naam can neither be spoken nor
reduced to writing. None can read it and none can get
blessed with it without seeking the shelter of a Satguru.
This Naam is not an ordinary one that the people
normally think. If this ‘Naam’ falls within the limit of 52
letters, even the children can be able to speak it. It is totally
wrong to think that any Guru, competent or incompetent, can
bless the devotees with ‘Naam’.
The real Naam is a rare one and an alive one.
Goswami Tulsi Dass Ji says that the real ‘Naam’ is
even greater than Brahma and Ram. Even if one attains a status
equivalent to that of Brahma and Shiv, one can’t cross the
worldly ocean without getting blessed with the bodiless Naam
(Alive Holy Name).
Kabir Sahib cautions us saying–
Koti Naam Sansaar Mein, Tinte Mukti Na Hoye.
Mool Naam Jo Gupt Hai, Janey Birla Koye.
Countless Naams are prevalent in the world but these
can’t help a devotee seek salvation. The real Naam is a
hidden one and only some rare fellow is in the knows
about it.
In fact, the real ‘Naam’ itself is Param Purush. While
blessing with Naam, the Satguru makes the power of Param


102 Sahib Bandgi
Purush active within the disciple. That is why the Guru has
been accorded a status higher than that of God.
Kabira Hari Ke Roothte, Guru Ki Sharni Jaye.
Kahey Kabir Guru Roothte, Hari Na Hoat Sahaye.
Kabir Sahib says that a devotee can seek the shelter of a
Guru if God gets offended with him but if, on any
account, the Guru gets offended with him, even God
can’t come to his rescue.
This Saar Naam is very powerful as it can help a
devotee to know the real identity of Mind and keep it under
control. So to say that the enemies within you begin to lose
their power.
Ja Ghat Naam Na Sancharae, Ta Ko Jaan Masan.
Jaise Khaal Lohar Ki, Shavans Lait Bin Praan.
You should take the body of a person who hasn’t got
blessed with Naam, as just like a graveyard.
Such a body is, so to say, like the dead skin of a
blacksmith that breathes even without the vital force.
Guru Nanak Devji has said–
Naam Bina Vishte Ka Keeda.
Without Naam, a man is just like the insect that
feeds on filth.
Ooncha Vahi Jo Naam Hin Jana,
Bina Naam Sab Neech Bakhana.
Only he who has got blessed with Naam, can be taken as
one with a high status while all those who haven’t got
blessed with Naam, are of a low status.
Even the study of holy books and performance of
noble deeds can’t help man gain a victory over Mind. Even
austerities can’t help in this regard.
We can’t see a thing clearly in darkness. As soon as


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 103
we switch on the light, the thing becomes visible. In the field
of worship, it is only the spiritual power of Naam that can
create the needed light and awareness in a devotee thereby
enabling him to understand his mind clearly. A Satguru helps
the devotee in fixing concentration.
At present, your Mind is the master while after getting
blessed with Sajeevan Naam, it begins to behave like a slave
and loses its power to mislead you. If you see a stone coming
to you, you can save yourself by moving aside. But, if you
fail to see it, it can hit you. Likewise, a devotee who has been
blessed with Naam, can save himself from being hit by the
stones of Mind (in the form of anger, lust etc.) with the power
that has become active within him. Bodiless Naam awakens
the soul that has the power like that of God.
In fact, all the problems come to an end after getting
blessed with ‘Naam’ that has the power to put brakes on the
hitherto uncontrolled activities of Mind.
One day, on our way, we saw two bullocks being driven by a
small girl. My driver said what would happen if the bullocks
turned restless. I told him not to worry and told him that small
girl had full control over them. She had in her hands the rope
tied to their nostrils and with its help she could turn them in
the direction of her liking. Likewise, even an ordinary man
can gain control over Mind when the Satguru prepares the
ground for it by blessing him with Sajeevan Naam. Kabir Sahib
spoke in Hindi that was a pure Hindustani one. But Hindi, that
we make use of in it present times, has been developed from
the combination of 4 languages–Bhoj puri, Avadhi, Brij and
Urdu. As such, he who has the knowledge of these 4
languages, can understand it easily. Kabir Sahib had full
knowledge of these four languages. His sayings create a
strange awareness in man. For instance–


104 Sahib Bandgi
Kasturi Kundal Basey, Mrigh Dhoodhe Ban Maahin.
Aise Ghat Ghat Saiyan, Moorakh Jaanat Naahin.
The musk lies within the Naval of deer but it wanders
about in the forest in search of it. Likewise, God is
present within every human being but the fools have no
knowledge of it.
In fact, a Guru removes the veil of Maya (illusion)
through ‘Naam’.
Jabhin Naam Hriday Dhara, Hua Paap Ka Naash.
Jaise Chingi Aag Ki, Paddi Purani Ghaas.
Naam destroys the evils from within in a manner a cinder
burns down the dry grass.
Redness is present in the Mehndi leaves but makes its
appearance only when it is ground and applied to the skin.
Without coming in contact with the skin, the redness can’t
make its full appearance. Likewise, the powers inherent in us
will make their appearance only when we get blessed with
bodiless Naam.
Guru Aagya Te Aavhi, Guru Aagya Te Jaey.
Kahey Kabir Ta Dass Ko, Teen Lok Darr Naahey.
A disciple, who acts as per the dictates of his Guru,
needn’t fear anything in all the 3 Lok’s.
In fact, under the protection of a perfect Guru, the
disciple doesn’t suffer from anything. Miraculous powers
remain with him and his salvation is guaranteed.
The power of ‘Naam’ will reveal to you that none else but your
Mind is your greatest enemy. Kabir Sahib says–
Mann Jeev Ko Bharmae Soyi, Mann Ka Kaha Na Keejai Koyi.
Mann Hi Aahe Kaal Karala, Jeev Nachaye Karey Behala.
Don’t obey the dictates of Mind as it misleads everyone
at each step. It is Kaal itself and makes the Soul dance
to its tune.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 105
Usko Kaal Kya Karey, Jo Aath Paher Hoshiyar.
Kaal can do no harm to one who is alert for all the eight
Pehars. You should remember that it is the Mind that
robs the soul from its charming pleasures.
If you keep a basket of rose flowers, you will enjoy
the fragrance of rose that spreads all around but if you place
a basket of filth near by, you won’t be able to enjoy the
fragrance of rose flowers. The foul smell subdues the
fragrance. Likewise, the fragrance of the soul has been
subdued by the ill-effect of Mind that remains in its company.
The fragrance of the rose flowers can be enjoyed only when
we remove the basket of filth. Just as the clouds can’t stop
the light and rays of the sun from reaching the earth for ever,
Mind-Body also can’t destroy the fragrance of the Soul. At
the most, they can eclipse it for some time like the clouds.
The Guru, by blessing with the power of Naam, creates
awareness within the disciple that removes the clouds of
ignorance created by Mind-Body.
Fix your concentration at your Guru. The Vedas also
say so. Even Vasudev Krishan said to Arjun, “He who worships
the gods, attains the dev lok. Likewise, the worshipper of
Pitars attains the Pitar Lok and the worshipper of the evil
spirits attain the Praet lok. You should leave aside the worship
of all and should remain absorbed in me.” Lord Krishan was
the Guru of Arjun and clearly the Gita also speaks about the
high status of a Guru.
In fact, a true Guru is the treasure-house of Spiritual
powers. He always remain absorbed in Supreme Lord, and
fixing concentration at Him makes your soul become more
and more awakened. Fixing of concentration at the Satguru
does the task of charging your concentration. But, his holy
vision has its own significance. Kabir Sahib says–
Guru Ka Darshan Kijiye, Din Mein Kai Kai Bar.
Aasuya Ka Meh Jyoun, Bahut Karey Upkar.


106 Sahib Bandgi
Try to have the vision of your Guru as many times a day
as you can. It is as beneficial as the rain water of the
Aasuya month.
This water has the power to change into camphor, when
drop down on a banana tree and into Banslochan when drop
down on a bamboo tree and this rain of the Ashivan (Assu)
month, no doubt, works wonders at the time of Swati
Nakshattar (a sign of Zodaic). Likewise, the holy vision of a
Satguru can work wonders. So the devotees should have this
holy vision as many times a day as they can.
So to say, it charges your concentration and weakens
the power of your Mind which, otherwise, keeps you
entangled in the outer world.
Mann Par Jo Asvaar Hai, Aisa Birla Koye.
It is only some rare devotee who can have a control over
his mind.
None in the entire universe can even dream of any
other ‘Naam’ that can help him do so. After getting blessed
with bodiless Naam, your concentration will become charged
and awakened. It will help you watch the entire game being
enacted by the Mind. That is to say, the power of your
awakened concentration is far superior to that of your Mind.
Saat Dweep Prithvi Parikarma,
Saar Shabd Boojhe Na Brahma.
Saar Shabd Jab Aave Hatha,
Tab He Mann Navaye Matha.
Kabir Sahib says that even Brahma, who toured the
entire 7 continents, couldn’t have any knowledge of Saar-
Naam. This Munn bows only before one who gets blessed
with this Saar Naam (Alive Holy Name).
Let me tell you the nature of Mind. The children play
in the dust as they have a liking for it. They throw it on one
another and feel pleasure in it. This is their nature. You have
grown old so you try to keep yourself away from this dust. A
buffalo has love for mud. This is a reflection of its nature.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 107
Likewise, other insects, animals, birds have their own
different natures. In the same manner, the mind also has its
own peculiar nature. The different states of Mind can be
controlled by bringing the mind itself under control. With this
control over mind, you will feel yourself as the master of
everything you find in the world.
Also, control over mind implies not to act as per its
dictates. Whenever you sit in meditation, the mind diverts
your attention to other worldly things. After getting blessed
with Naam, you will become alert and will save yourself from
being swayed by it.
In fact, the soul can enjoy its eternal and nectarrean
pleasures only when the mind is brought under control. The
treasure of everlasting pleasures lies within you. It hasn’t to
be imported from anywhere. It has only been veiled by the
waves of mind. In Yog Vashisht Maha Ramayana, Ramji said
to his Guru, “This world is full of sorrows and sufferings.”
Vashisht ji said, “O Ram! which world are you talking about?
There is no such world.” Ramji said, “Then what do all these
things like you, me, the relations, the sun and the moon
signify?” Vashisht ji said, “O Ram! all this is nothing but a
play of your remembrance (memory). Control this memory
and you will find no trace of this world.”
Kabir Sahib also says–
Kehat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Jagat Bana Hai Mann Se.
The existence of this world is due to Mind alone.
So you should try to bring this mind under control. In
Yog Vashishatha, Vashisht ji has imparted all the possible
knowledge to Ramji about the material world but, Kabir Sahib
is the unparallelled master of the knowledge related to Mind.
The power within you is decentralized but the Guru
centralizes it through the power of Naam. After this, your
interior (heart) becomes enlightened and awakened.


108 Sahib Bandgi
If there is everything in the room like a match stick, a
lamp with oil and wick and still you find a fellow sitting in
darkness, it clearly reflects the ignorance of that fellow. This
ignorance and darkness can be removed only when someone
tells him how to light the lamp that is available in that very room.
There are many hidden powers within you as well.
There is no need to obtain any power from outside. None can
stop the soul from going back to its original abode. All that
is needed is to help it to know its real identity.
A certain Princess had been wearing a necklace of
pearls. It got entangled in her clothes. She thought she had
lost it. She tried to find it out but couldn’t do so. Then her
friend came to her and told her that the necklace was very
much there in her neck. The confusion of the princess was
the result of her ignorance alone. Likewise, God as well is
not far away from you.
Priyatam Ko Pattiyan Likhun, Jo Kahin Basey Videsh.
Tann Mein Mann Mein Nayan Mein, Ta Ko Kaun Sandesh.
The need to write a letter to the beloved, one can arise
only if he lives in some foreign country.
There is no need to send any message to the one who
is present within the body, mind and eyes.
In a dream, a lady found that her child had been lost.
She was very much perturbed. When she woke up, she found
that the child was sleeping with her.
Likewise, Supreme Lord is hidden from our sight.
None can see Him with external eyes. He can be found only
through the bodiless Naam (soundless sound). The worldly
Naams can’t help in this regard. A Satguru helps the soul unite
with Supreme Lord through the power of Naam.

### The Rare Powers Hidden

### Within The Human Body

The wonders man has performed in the materialistic
field clearly show his superiority over other living creatures.
Even the gods aspire to have this human form. There is some
definite reason behind calling this body as a rare one and an
abode of God. But man hasn’t been able to make use of all
of his powers–be they related to the physical world or to the
inner spiritual world. Man has made grand multi-storied
buildings, aeroplanes, trains, satellites and a lot of other
things that no other creature can even dream of.
So to say, man has an inexhaustible treasure of
material power. The other kinds of rare powers possessed by
him are related to the inner world. But, he has not been able
to make use of his inner powers to the extent he ought to have
done. In Dwapar yug, there were no towers or televisions like
today. But still, Sanjay, sitting in Hastinapur, told every detail
of the happenings in Kurukshetra to Dhritarashtra. It shows
that India had made much advancement in the field related to
the inner spiritual world.
Let’s have a look at the nature of these miraculous
powers which are present within every human being. These
miraculous powers can enable man to know about his past as
well as the future. He can also know about the happenings that
are taking place all over the world. These inner powers can


110 Sahib Bandgi
enable him to make trips in the whole of universe as well.
All that is needed is to awaken the related tissues.
Man lives his life in four states. These are–Jagrat,
Swapna, Sushupti and Turiya. Other creatures don’t possess
these states.
Jagrat Awastha (Waking state) : This is the first
state. In this state, our soul resides in eyes. As our
concentration has its place in the eyes, we see the world made
out of 5 material elements. Particular tissues of the body
remain active during this state. But, the fact is that the
existence of the universe we experience for the time being
is nothing but the imagination of our Chitt (remembrance).
Jyoun Supna Aur Pekhna Aise Jag Ko Jaan,
In Mein Kachhu Sacho Nahin Nanak Bin Bhagwaan.
Guru Nanak Dev ji says that the creation of the universe
is just like that of seeing a dream. There is nothing but
truth and truth alone other than God.
All the sorrows and pleasures that we experience are
nothing but the imagination of our Mind.
Swapna Awastha (Dream state) : This is the 2nd
state. Every man see dreams during sleep. It is really a
miracle that we move out of this body and attain another body
that performs all sorts of activities for us. In this state, our
soul resides in a nerve that lies on the left side of our throat.
This nerve is hundred times thinner than even the pore of the
body. It lies at a safe place on the left side of our throat and
it is the only nerve that makes us see all the dreams.
Sometimes, when some defect develops in this nerve, man
fails to see any dream. Man spends a great part of his life in
this dream state. The world we see in our dream state is a
very strange one but the existence of this world vanishes


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 111
when we wake up from sleep. The dreams appear as an
imagination alone.
Sushupti Awastha (Deep sleep): This is the 3rd state.
It provides complete rest to your body. The navel region is
the main centre for fixing concentration. All sorts of thoughts
will stop bothering you and your brain will get complete rest.
The spinal cord helps one attain this state that is also called
as the state of deep and sound sleep. After getting up, you
fail to remember and recollect anything for some time. Then
your concentration reaches the eyes and you are able to know
where you are.
The yogis reach this state where the feelings of
pleasures or pain vanish. They take it as a state full of
pleasures. In this state, mind remains inactive.
Turiya Awastha : This is the 4th state in which we see
the inner world in an awakened manner. In this state, our soul
has its abode in Sushumna nerve and it enables us to have a
vision of the entire universe. In this state, the world appears
exactly in a manner one sees it in the dream state. Even the
state of waking appears like a farce. Only the yogis attain this
state that is also called as Pragya state.
The yogic states of man : There are six bodies within
the physical body of every human being. The first one is the
Sthool Shareer that is perishable. All the creatures have been
carrying on their activities with this gross body. All of us know
this body. Rare yogic powers are inherent within the organs
of the body. The Second one is the Sukshma Shareer that
we attain in our sleep. The Jiva sees many abodes–big and
small–in its dream state through this body. The activities of
this subtle body are very strange, indeed. All that we see in
our dream state appears to be true. Man spends about 1/3 of
his life in sleep. We have a deep relation with this body. The


112 Sahib Bandgi
pleasures and pains we experience in this state seem to be
exactly like the ones we experience in the waking state.
The Third one is the Kaaran Shareer. It is also a very
wonderful body. This body has a great wisdom. For instance,
if you are attending a satsang and are listening to me and
looking at me, you won’t be able to either look at me or listen
to me if, even for a while, your concentration gets diverted.
You won’t be able to understand as to what I said even though
your eyes will remain open. It means, this body has the power
to see, to hear and understand. It also means that we can send
this body to any place we like and can know about the
happenings taking place over there. It is very subtle. Vashishat
Muni had a complete knowledge of it. Everyone makes use
of this body. While making plans about the future or thinking
about the past happenings, we find ourselves at that very
place.
The fourth one is the Maha-Kaaran Shareer. It is
really a very wonderful body full of all sorts of experiences.
The yogis and great worshippers use it to undertake trips to
other universes. This body can help us have a complete
knowledge of our real identity. Through yoga, this body can
be separated from our gross body in a manner the butter is
separated from the curd by churning it.
The fifth one is the Gyandehi Shareer. After attaining
this body, the devotee becomes Brahm like and attains the
power to create a universe. It was the possession of great such
like powers that made even the gods feel afraid of devotees
like the king Bali, Vishwa Mittar and Vashishat Muni. This
body is present within each one of us and it can enable us
not only to make trips upto 3 Lok’s but also to see the various
abodes—big and small—that are to be found there.


The Whole Play Is That Of Concentration 113
We can run on the earth with the help of vehicles like
motorcycle, car etc. but we can’t use them in water. This is
because these are not fitted with any such system that can
make them run in water. So this body can help us have anything
we desire. So to say, it can give us all the miraculous powers
but it can’t help us go beyond the 3 Lok’s.
The sixth one is the Vigyandehi Shareer. It can help
us attain all that can be found upto Maha Shunya. Though in
this state, the soul remains very much awakened, yet the
existence of Mind also remains there. This body is so subtle
that it can even pass through a rock. Guru Nanak Devji and
Kabir Sahib have made a mention of this body. Guru Nanak
Devji has said–
Akhan Bajhon Dekhna, Bin Kanni Sunna
Pairan Bajhon Chalna, Bin Hathin Karna
It can see without eyes and can hear without ears. It can
walk without feet and can work without hands.
‘Hathin Bajhon Karna.’
It can work without hands.
Lord Krishan has also made a mention of it. He says
to Arjun, “This soul has no eyes but it can see in all the
directions. It has no feet but it has the power to move in all
the directions. It has no ears but can hear every sound coming
from any direction. Likewise, it can speak though it has no
mouth. Finally, it doesn’t get destroyed in any set of
circumstances.”
Goswami Tulsi Dass ji as well has expressed similar
views about this body. He says that it is not easy to describe
the glory of this body.


114 Sahib Bandgi
Kabir Sahib has described this body in a beautiful
manner.
Paer Bin Chal Gaya Shehar Begum Pura.
Tahan Bain Bin Bolna Nain Bin Boojhai.
Aap Ka Khel Kaho Kaun Janey.
The soul needs no feet to reach Amarlok. It can hear
without ears. Can do different kinds of works without
hands.
Our physical feet have a limited power to move it but
the soul possesses the feet that can move with unlimited
power. Shivli (an enlightened soul) was given very hard
punishment. His hands were cut off as per the orders of the
king but he said that he possessed such hands who could help
him to reach upto God. Then the king ordered for the removal
of his eyes. He said that he had no need for these eyes as he
possessed such eyes who could see God. Again, when his feet
were cut off, he said that he possessed the rare feet one of
which reaches the Kingdom of God. Then the king ordered
the executioners to cut off his tongue as well. But, he asked
them to stop a bit. He offered his thanks to God for giving
him the power to pass all these severe tests. Then, he asked
the executioners to cut off his tongue as well because it didn’t
have the power to talk to God. He was in possession of such
a tongue which had the power to talk to God.
I want to make you understand that, apart from man,
there is no other living creature in the whole of universe who
is in possession of these six inner bodies.
It is really strange to see a man, even inspite of
possessing such miraculous bodies, has been wandering like
a perturbed and worried being.

##### True Sayings of Sahib Ji

Tann Ki Jaaney Mann Ki Jaaney Ghatt Ki Jaaney Chori,

Uss ‘Sahib’ Se Kya Chhipa Hai Jiskey Haath Mein Dori.

Sahib Ji says that ‘Sahib’ who is the Supreme Lord of
souls knows each and every movement of body, mind and
heart. He holds the life force of every living being. So, you
have nothing of your own which you can hide from the eyes
of ‘Sahib’.
Koti Naam Sansaar Mein, Tintey Mukti Na Hoey.
Mool Naam Joh Gupt Hai, Jaaney Virla Koey.
Sahib Ji says that there are crore over ‘Holy Names’
(Words) present in this mortal world, which all are unable to
provide us permanent salvation. Whereas, the true ‘Alive Holy
Name’ which holds the supreme power to provide us
permanent salvation is an absolute secret which is only known
to a rare being in this mortal world.
Mann Ki Tarang Maar Do, Toh Ho Gaya Bhajan.
Aadat Buri Sudhaar Lo, Toh Ho Gaya Bhajan.
Aaye Ho Tum Kahan Se, Aur Jana Hai Kahan.
Itna Sa Bas Vichaar, Lo Toh Ho Gaya Bhajan.
Sahib Ji says that by just killing the commands (comes
in form of vibrations to the brain) of mind and by leaving all
the bad habits, your worshippness to Supreme Lord is over.
‘Where have you come from and Where you have to go’; by
just giving a sincere thought to it, your worshippness to
Supreme Lord is over.
Teen Lok Hai Aawa Gamana,
Chautha Lok Hai Satguru Bhawana.
**115**


116 Sahib Bandgi
Sahib Ji says that all the three lok’s which is the territory
of ‘Kaal Niranjan’ (Mind) has no permanent exit for a soul
from the circle of birth and death. Every single soul will keep
on revolving in the continuous cycle of birth and death within
the creation of ‘Kaal Niranjan’.

Whereas, the true abode of a Satguru is the 4th loka
which exists beyond Kaal Niranjan’s territory and is the only
permanent exit available for a soul which leads back to origin.

Kabir Mann Toh Ek Hai, Bhavey Jahan Lagaey.
Bhavey Guru Ki Bhakti Kar, Bhavey Vishaey Kamaey.
Sahib Ji says that Mind is only one and can be involve
into any kind of activity in life. It’s upto you, that either you
involve mind in the worship of a true Guru or you involve
mind in lustful activities.

‘Amarlok’ Hai Sabse Nyara,
Mann Maya Na Pavey Para.
Sahib Ji says that ‘Amarlok’ which is the true origin of
all the souls is unique as in comparison to other abodes which
are present in this universe. Mind and Body cannot go beyond
the limits of universe, and does not have their reach upto
‘Amarlok’ which exists beyond universe.

Sabki Gathri Laal Hai,
Koi Nahin Kangaal.
Sahib Ji says that every single human being on earth is
filled up with equal miraculous powers and has no
differentiation of any type at all between a poor and a rich.
No individual being is empty from inside and has the presence
of same Soul which truly belongs to ‘Sahib’ (Supreme Lord).
