# A Few Words

Many devotees have experienced that whenever they
begin to indulge in some wrong act even unknowingly or
whenever they are about to meet some accident, some
hidden power comes to their rescue. This hidden power is
nothing but the power of "Naam" about which I have
repeatedly said—
Guru Sajeevan Naam Bataye.
Jakey Bal Hansa Ghar Jaye.
Kag Palat Hansa Ker Deena.
Aisa Purush Naam Main Deena.
Satguru reveals the rare Alive 'Naam' that has the
power to take a Hansa to its original abode Amarlok, and
it transform the crow like mind in to that of a celestial
Swan

"The Thing I possess is not to be found

anywhere else in this universe"

- Satguru Madhu Paramhans Sahib.

Kal Niranjan is the fifth son of Param Purush, born
out of word. He is known as Nirakar Niranjan, Adi
Narayan, Adi Shiv, Adi Brahman and Mind etc. This
world addresses him as Rama, Brahma, Shiva, and also
remaind him as Niranjan, Kadar, Kareem, Parameshwar,
Paramatma, Hari, Non dual and Alak Niranjan etc. This
Niranjan is given thousand names in Religious Scriptures.
_Duniya Jisko ‘Paramatma’ Maaney,
Sohi ‘Kaal’ Koi Bheid Na Jaaney._ Sant Kabir
The ‘Power’ who is ruling over the universe, whom
the whole world considers and worship, as ‘God’; is no
one else but ‘Kaal Purush’ (God of Death/Mind/Mann).
This secret is unknown to the whole of humanity.

## 1. The founder of Spiritualism

Sant Samraat Kabir Sahib (1398-1518)

In the year 1398, Sahib Kabir, the founder of
Spiritualism, appeared in the Lahar Tara pond of Kashi, in
the early hours of the full moon day of Monday. No other
sage has so many misconceptions attached to him as have
been attached to Sahib Kabir regarding his birth. Some
described him as the offspring of an unmarried lady; some
described him as the offspring of a low caste lady while
others coined other unbelievable stories about him. Even
today his birth has been a sort of riddle for the worldly
people although he has himself revealed the secret related
to his birth in his own words.
He has said—
Santo Avigat Se Hum Aye, Koyi Bhed Bharam Na Paye
Na Hum Rahle Garab Vas Mein, Balak Hoyi Dikhlaya
Kashi Tatt Srovar Bheetar, Tahan Julaha Paya
Na Hamre Bhai Bandhu Hain,Na Sung Girhi Dassi
Neeru Ke Ghar Nam Dharaye, Jug Mein Ho Geyi Hasi
Aane Takiya Ung Hamari,Ajaramar Pur Dera
Hukam Haisiyat Se Chaley Aye, Katan Yam Ka Phera
Kashi Mein Hum Prakat Huye,Ramanand Per Dhaya
Kahai Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Hans Chetavan Aya
I have come from an unknown place. None could
know the secret related to me. Without staying in the
womb of the mother, I appeared as a child. A weaver
found me in the pond of Kashi. Neither I have any
relations nor any wife.
Getting a name in the house of Neeru made me a
laughing stock in the world. My abode is in Amarlok. I
have come here to save the Jivas-Humans from the grip of
Yamas- Lord of death. I appeared in Kashi and got blessed
with Naam from Ramanand. Listen to me and think over
what I say. I have come to create awakening among the
Humen.


6 Sahib Bandgi
At many places Sahib Kabir has revealed many
secrets related to him. These leave no doubt in the minds
of the readers that he appeared on this earth not from the
womb of the mother but from the rare and dazzling light
of Param Purush of Amarlok. Dear readers, I don’t intend
to give rise to any unnecessary discussion or to create any
misconception in the minds of the people.
I have only tried to present before you a great truth.
The word Kabir has in it the entire truth about Sahib
Kabir.
'Kakka Kewal Nam Hai, Babba Baran Sharir'
R-Ra Sub Mein Rum Raha, Jis Ka Nam Kabir
Gagan Mandal Se Utre, Satguru Satya Kabir
Jagg Manhi Paudan Kiya, Sub Peeron Ke Peer
Jaap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mer Jaye
Surti Samani Shabad Mein, Usko Kaal Na Khaye
Recitation by mouth as well as the inward recitation
perish away. But it is the Surti (present in Naam itself)
that can’t be destroyed by Kaal.
Musical notes are present within us. Some get
absorbed in them. Some take these very notes as God
itself. But one can’t move beyond the limit of Turiateet (
State of Maha Yogeswars-Trinity) on the basis of these.
The notes perish away. Then what kind of word can we
call these? That is to say, we can’t take Dhunatmic
(Sounds) word as well as the Varanatmic (Syllable) word
as the real Naam.
Sahib Kabir says—
So To Shabad Vidhey.
That word is Muktatmic, that is to say, it is nothing
but a soundless sound.
Do Bin Hoye Na Awaz
Sound can be produced only when two objects strike
and where there is sound, there is Maya.
Hadd Tappe So Auliya, Be-Hadd Tappe To Peer.
Had Be-Hadd Dono Tappe, Tiska Nam Kabir.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 7
He who crosses the limit is taken as an Auliya and
he who crosses the limitless is taken as a peer (a great
sage) but one who goes beyond both of these is none else
but Sahib Kabir.
All the spiritually enlightened sages of the earlier
times agreed to his views in letter and spirit. He presented
in a simple way the means that could help the devotees
worship the real God (Param Purush) even while leading a
family life. He revealed in the language of the common
masses the ways and means to open the Sushumna nerve.
The holy Nam he has talked about has the power to
take the devotee in the pure spiritual world. A very high
place has been given to the sayings of Sahib Kabir in the
holy Granth Sahib. Dadu Dayal Ji has shown his regard
for Sahib Kabir in his own way. He says—
Kete Santa Koop Hai, Kete Sarita Neer
Dadu Agam Athah Hai, Dariya Satya Kabir
Satya Kabir Is Like A Limitless River.
He Resides Within The Hearts Of All.
Bani Arab Va Kharablaun,Granthan Koti Hazar
Karta Purush Kabir Hai, Nabhe Kiya Vichar
The Sant Nabha Ji says that one may study countless
sayings and thousands of religious scriptures but the fact
remains that it is Satya Kabir alone who is the doer.
Dadu Dayal Ji says—
Dadu Naam Kabir Ka, Jo Koyi Leve Oat
Usko Kabhi Na Lagsi, Kaal Bazar Ki Choat
He who gets blessed with the holy Naam of Sahib
Kabir, remains safe from the attack of Kaal.
Gareeb Dass Ji says—
Gagan Mandal Se Utre, Sahib Purush Kabir
Chola Dhara Khavas Ka, Torey Yam Janjeer
Sahib Kabir has descended on the earth in the guise
of a Sevak to free the Jivas from the chains of Yama.


8 Sahib Bandgi
Guru Nanak Dev Ji too held Kabir Sahib in high
esteem. He has described him as a flawless Sant Samrat
who is the real well wisher and savior of the humanity.
These words of the holy Sants leave no doubt in the
minds of the devotees about the fact that Sahib Kabir was
not a human being. Normally everyone sings the glory of
his own deity-God, but there is some reality and depth in
what I have said. You should think over it in an impartial
manner
All of you know that he appeared on this universe on
the Jyesht Sudhi Poornima of the year 1 398. After
spreading the message of true and real form of worship for
a period of 120 years, he decided to go to his real abode in
Amarlok.
As such, at the time of his departure he thought of
revealing to the world his real identity. He did so to
remove the misconceptions that had been created by the
vested interests regarding his birth. He declared that he
would depart from the world on Magh Sudhi Ekadsi (a
particular day of the particular month) of the year 15 18 at
Maggar ( near Gorakh Pur ). Hearing this declaration
Lakhs of people gathered there. Among them there were
Veer Singh Baghel, the king of Kashi and Nawab Bijli
khan of Awadh. Both of them were the disciples of Sahib
Kabir. They came along with their selected army men.
Apart from them, a large number of disciples of Sahib
Kabir and the common people came there. Many of them
had come there simply to watch the miraculous
happening.
Veer Singh Baghel ordered his army chief to be
prepared to take the dead body of Sahib Kabir to Kashi
where he would erect a Samadhi after performing the last
rites. When Bijli Khan came to know of it, he said that he
won’t allow such a thing to happen. Sahib Kabir was his
Guru and he would erect a Mazar (tomb) after performing
his last rites as per his religion. Veer Singh reminded him


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 9
that Sahib advocated vegetarianism, that it will send
wrong message.
Mansahari Manva, Pratayaksh Rakshas Jan.
Taki Sangat Na Karo, Hoye Bhakti Mein Hani.
Both of them drew their swords and were prepared
to have a fight. In the meantime, a miracle occurred. A
rare kind of light appeared in the sky and there was a word
which said —
Uthao Parda Nehin Hai Murda.
E-Murakh Nadana Tum Ne Hum Ko Nehin Pahchana
"O fools! You have failed to recognize me. Remove
the sheet of cloth and see for yourself, there is no dead
body underneath".
When the sheet was removed, there appeared no
dead body. Only some lotus flowers were found. Sahib
Kabir performed this miracle in the presence of Lakhs of
people. The Hindus took the flowers and erected a
Samadhi whereas the Muslims took the sheet of cloth and
erected a Mazar. These two memorials stand there even
today and bear witness to the fact that Sahib Kabir was not
a human being. He was , in fact, Param Purush Himself.
Give a serious thought to what I have said and see
how much truth is hidden in it. Prior to it, none in this
universe entered without a mother and departed without
leaving his body. This was the first and the last kind of
miracle that Sahib Kabir showed to the worldly people.
His sayings would continue to guide the people about the
ways and means that can help them in reaching their
original home, Amarlok. The eternal indestructible 4th
world.
His philosophy and Ideology can help a lot in
establishing peace all over the world now.
Satya Sahib Kabir They, Kah Gaye Sant Sabhi
All the Sants have declared in one voice that Sahib
Kabir was nothing but truth and truth alone.
Ravi Dass JI says—


10 Sahib Bandgi
Swami! Jo Tum Gavo So Hi Gavun, Tumhara Geyan Vicharun
Kahain Rai Dass Suno Ho Swami, Bharam Karam Sub Chadun
Leaving all kinds of rites and superstitions, I would
believe only in that which you say. Nabha Dass Ji says—
Pani Te Paida Nehin, Swasa Nehin Sharir
Ann Ahar Kerta Nehin, Tako Nam Kabir
He hasn’t been created out of water and doesn’t have
a body that breathes. He doesn’t take any food even. That
Sant Samrat is none else but Kabir.
Guru Nanak Dev Ji has described him as the first
ever Sant of the world who spread the real form of
worship ( related to Param Purush ) all over the world.
Amli Ho Ker Dharey Dheyan, Girhi Ho Ker Kathe Geyan
Sadhu Ho Ker Koote Bhagg, Kahe Kabir Yeh Teeno Thug
Sahib Kabir asks the devotees to take all the three —

1. One who consumes drugs and sits in meditation.
2. A family holder who recites Kathas ( religious
   discourses ). and
3. A sage who indulges in sexual activities —as
   cheats who misleads.

There are number of Sants in the world today, but none
talks of any other authority that lies beyond the Vedas &
the Scriptures. Sant Samrat Kabir Sahib has clearly said—
Ved Hamara Bheid Hain, Hum Vedan Ke Mahin.
Jaun Bheid Mein Main Bason, Vedbhi Janat Nahin.
Sant Kabir Sahib says that the Vedas &scriptures have in
them the secrets of all of us, but even they can’t tell about
the secret of my abode.
Iske Aage Bhed Hamara, Janey Ga Koyi Jananhara.
Kahein Kabir Janey Ga Soyi, Ja Per Daya Satguru Ki Hoyi.
Sant Kabir Sahib says that his mystery is far beyond the
limits of Niranjan. Only such a devotee as has the
blessings of a Satguru with him, can know it.

## 2. Questions and answers on Spiritualism


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 11
on Spiritualism
Q-1) You say the thing you possess is not to be
**found anywhere else in the Brahmand. Doesn’t it show**
your ego?
A.) Study carefully the words I say. I say the thing I
possess is not to be found anywhere else in the Brahmand.
This is because it belongs to the 4th Loka, also called as
Amarlok. These simple words create unnecessary
discussion.
There are 5 kinds of ego.

1. One related to strength.
2. The 2nd one related to beauty.
3. The 3rd one related to wealth.
4. The 4th one related to Education.
5. The 5th one related to Clan/caste/color/race.
   I am not an egotist. I visit the whole of India all
   alone. If I desire, I can have a body guard with me. I don’t
   decorate my body. I wear simple clothes. I mean to say,
   none can find in me any sign like that of an egotist.
   However, I say with a sense of full faith and confidence
   that the thing I possess is not to be found anywhere else in
   the entire Brahmand.
   Even if a poor person asks me to visit his house, I
   accompany him. I don’t let anyone massage my hands or
   feet. I move about like a Servent. If you judge my disciple
   closely, you will find them as rare ones from others. All
   this is due to the miracle of that thing.
   Sub Mein Tera Jalva Sma Raha Hai
   I see the same soul in all. So what is that I should
   boast of.
   You may have more bones and muscles while
   someone else may have less. On seeing such a weak
   fellow you may abuse and frighten him in every possible
   manner. If we do so, it is nothing but an ego related to the


12 Sahib Bandgi
bones and muscles. If we see the soul alone, we won’t feel
any sense of ego.
People boast of having unlimited wealth. When I
have no money, what is that I should boast of. People say
I have constructed so many Ashrams. I say none of these
stands in my name. All these have been constructed out of
the money contributed by the disciples.
You care for bones and wealth but ignore the soul
whereas we are concerned with the soul alone.
Sub Mein Atam Roop Pachhan
Try to see the soul in all.
Even if I get control over whole of the world, I shall
remain the same. Remember! It is only ignorance that
gives birth to ego. So ego means ignorance. Earlier I used
to hold satsang seating myself on the ground. I did so for 7
years. But the people had to stand up a bit to see me. As
such, I got a Takhat Posh ( a wooden, table- like platform,
used for sitting ) constructed for holding satsangs from
there. The people began to decorate it. I didn’t allow them
to keep even the flowers there. Some come with a
garlands in hand but I refuse to accept it. In short, I live in
complete simplicity. That which you take as ego is
nothing but my self confidence and faith. That is truth and
truth alone.
Sometimes a shopkeeper says the chilies he is selling
is of a special variety and is not to be found with other
shopkeepers. He tells the place from where he has brought
it. In the same manner, the thing I talk about is not to be
found in this world. It is to be found in the 4th Loka alone
.After getting it, a devotee achieves three things. I have
tried the effect of this thing not on one or two but on
Lakhs of devotees. There is no doubt about it. Three
things that one achieves are—

1. The Mind (Munn) and the Soul get separated.


```
Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 13
```
2. The attraction for the worldly objects begins to
   fade.
3. One attains a full security cover.
   Every Naami after getting blessed with Naam
   experiences changes within him.
   Every one seems to be dancing to the tune of Mind.
   After all, Mind is very powerful. But such a thing has
   stopped happening with my Naamis. This is because after
   getting blessed with Naam, the devotee becomes
   awakened. The Naamis (Initiates) belonging to other
   Panths will be found to have no control over their Mind.
   They are found to be spiritually not awakened. My
   Naamis find the activities of these Naamis just like those
   of disturbed persons. This is because there is no guarantee
   as to when they will behave as a good or a bad person.
   Secondly, my Naamis have control over their Mind.
   Their awakened soul enables them to understand the
   Mind. This is the most difficult job to perform.
   understanding the working of the Mind, the attraction for
   the worldly objects begins to fade. Thirdly, every Nami
   begins to feel the presence of an invisible power with him.
   In such circumstances why Shouldn’t I say that the
   thing I possess is not to be found anywhere else in the
   Brahmand. This thing enables the devotees to understand
   the true nature of their Soul.
   Why do we sit in meditation? We do so to know our
   real identity. None in the world can separate his Mind
   from the Soul. The Mind has entangled the soul in such a
   manner that it has lost its power to understand anything. If
   the Mind expresses the desire to take food, the Soul also
   expresses the same desire. All the activities being
   performed by man keep him entangled more and more in
   the Mayaic net. Even after satisfying their earnest desire,
   man finds it hard to free himself from the grip of Mind.


14 Sahib Bandgi
It is not easy to understand the games of Mind. It
will give wealth and other miraculous powers to man but
in no case it would allow him to escape from its clutches.
It is only the Satguru who can help man in attaining
freedom from its clutches and entanglements.
Ignorance is the first power of Mind. The Mind has
attaches itself on to the Soul in such a manner that the
latter has lost the power to know its real identity. However
hard one may try, one can’t cross the limit of Mind.
A Satguru alone has the power to enable a devotee
to know his Soul. Hansa has a wonderful property in its
beak. It takes only milk and leaves the water, if any, part
in it. None else can perform this wonder. Like the Hansa,
the Satguru as well has the power in his concentration (
Paras Surati) through which he can separate the Mind
from the Soul. He performs this job within a moment.
After this the Mind can’t reattach on to the Soul.
Doodh Ko Matth Grit Neyara Kiya
Palat Ker Phir Tahin Mein Nahin Smai
Once the ghee is extracted from the milk, it is not
possible to turn it back into milk. Likewise, if Butter is
obtained by churning the Curd, it is not possible to turn it
back into Curd.
In the same manner, Mind can’t attach again to the
Soul after Satguru separates it from the latter.
Koti Janam Ka Patth Tha|
Guru Pall Mein Diya Pahunchae||
The Satguru enabled the disciple cover within a
moment the path that couldn’t be covered even after
taking countless births.
When such a thing happens, the devotee feels a kind
of comfort as one feels when some thorn in his foot is
removed. After this the disciple won’t find it easy to feel
the same kind of attraction for the worldly objects.
Naam Paye Satya Jo Beera, Sung Rahun Main Dass Kabira


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 15
Sahib Kabir says that he remains with the devotee
who gets blessed with the true and real Naam.
Take it as true that the world will repent after my
departure from the world because there is truth and truth
in my statement that ‘The thing I possess is not to be
found anywhere else in the Brahmand’.
************************

Q-2) Can Jiva cross the worldly ocean of life and
Death on its own efforts?
A.) Certainly not, The Beings can’t escape from the
grip of Niranjan even after worshiping for crores of years,
Niranjan won’t allow the Jiva to even reach him. Even if
the beings manage to do so, it will forget its own identity.
Under no circumstances, the Jiva can hope to attain
permanent salvation. It is only Sant Satgurus who are in
possession of the 'Paras Surti'. with its miraculous power
they absorb the Jiva within them and take it to Amarlok. If
the Satgurus don’t do so, the powerful attraction of Mind
and Maya will bring the Jiva back to the earth.
Jeev Bechara Keya Karey, Jo Na Chhudave Peev
The poor and helpless Jiva can’t do anything on its
own. It is only the Satya Purush Himself who can save it.
Those who don’t believe it, ask their followers to do
charitable acts, prayers and pay visits to the holy places to
attain salvation. This is because they have no alternative
but to oppose the teachings of Sahib Kabir.
Sahib Kabir says that it is not possible for the Jiva to
escape from the clutches of Niranjan. In the Kathas (
recitations of stories from the holy books ) we hear about
the great Rishi Munies who worshiped hard for years
together but committed wrong acts under the sway of Lust
and anger. If this is the case with great worshipers, how
can a ordinary human being ever think of escaping from
the powerful net of Mind and Maya. Lust and anger are
only the hands of this Mind. That is why it is said—


16 Sahib Bandgi
Kitne Tapsi Tapp Ker Darey, Kaya Dari Gara
Grah Chhor Bhaye Sanyasi, Tau Na Pavat Para
Many worshipers worshiped hard. Some of them
even reduced their bodies to a skeleton. Some left their
homes and hearths even but still they failed to attain
salvation.
A sage asked as to how Guru would take the disciple
across the limit of three Lokas. He said that he was at a
loss to understand all this. No doubt, it is beyond the reach
of that sage. The simple reason, he is not equipped with
that power for the same. Sahib Kabir says—
Is Ke Aage Bheid Hamara, Janey Ga Koyi Janan Hara
The secret related to him lies beyond it. Only some
experienced person can have knowledge of it.
Those connected with other Panths ask their
disciples to perform all sorts of rites related to Yog. That
is why they don’t attach so much importance to the Guru.
But the Sants have accorded a very high place to the
Satguru. Sant Matt is altogether different from other
Panths. Earlier it was the word ’Yog’ that was prevalent.
The word ‘ Sant’ was nowhere to be found. In Sant Matt,
an easy path-Sahaj Marg for attaining salvation is
preached. The Sants say it with confidence that the
Satguru will help the disciple go across the worldly ocean
within moments. Has any Rishi Muni said so? Certainly
not will be the answer. The Sant Matt revolves round the
Satguru. It doesn’t talk of simply showing the path with
instructions. A Nirgun worshiper of Formless will talk of
one’s own earnings. This gives rise to misconceptions. We
are talking about two things—The sighting-Dharsan of
Satguru and service to him. So the lineage of Sants
revolves around these two things.
Hari Sewa Yug Char Hai, Guru Sewa Pal Ek
Even after serving God for 4 Yugas, one can’t attain
so much merit as one can attain by serving the Guru even
for a moment.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 17
Goswami Ji also said—
Yeh Sub Sadhan Se Na Hoyi, Tumhari Kripa Payey Koyi Koyi
Not with self efforts, but with the grace of Sahib,
one can attain salvation. Sahib Kabir has said—
Ada Ker Khud Khazane Se, Chhuda Le Apne Bande Ko
He asks the Guru to free the Jiva with Guru's own
power of grace.
That is to say, in this universe of Kaal (that is not the
real abode of the Jiva) the Hansa of Param Purush has got
entangled in many chains. It is impossible for it to free
itself from these chains on its own and reach Amarlok—
its real abode. Kabir Sahib said -
Pap Punya Ye Dono Beri, Ek Loha Ek Kanchan Keri.
Sahib is saying that both bad deeds and good, virtuous
deeds are like the links of a chain which is used to bind
the soul. The only difference is that one is made of iron
and the other is of gold.
Both kinds of worship—Sagun (With Form) as well
as Nirgun (Formless)—lay stress on making one’s own
earnings of merits. Here the Guru simply shows the path.
The devotee can rise only to the extent he makes the earn-
ings. This approach is limited to the 3 Lokas alone, where
the earnings and deeds bring fruit. Those who can’t afford
to make suitable arrangements for the same, waste away
their lives. However, in the true form of worship- Satya
Bhakti there is no importance attached to Karmic
earnings. This worship is related to Amarlok where there
is no requirements, whatsoever, of the Karmic earnings.
In Mahashunya, there are to be found many strong
kinds of magnetic attractions where the Jiva forgets itself.
At this time the Satguru brings it to senses and absorbing
it in himself, takes it safely to Amarlok.
Otherwise, the devotee can’t ever hope to cross those
places even after worshiping for crores of years.
Now Sant lineage got polluted with the passage of
time. The Vihangam (Bird) like moves began to disap-


18 Sahib Bandgi
pear. Only Meen and Papeel methods remains. Papeel
means an ant and Meen means a fish. Papeel Marg means
to visit the Brahmand with the speed of an ant whereas
Meen marg means to make upward and downward
movements like a fish. There are 5 Methods of Mudras
(postures). The first two kinds of Mudras are related to
Papeel whereas the other 3 Mudras are related to Meen
Marg. But it is only the Sants who adopt the Vihangam
like movements.
Kahain Kabir Vihangam Chaal Hamari
Sahib Kabir says that he adopts a Vihangam like
movement. During his visit to the Brahmand, the devotee
moves out of the body. He feels he is moving. It doesn’t
appear dream like to him. But the movement is somewhat
slow. He can see the 14 Lokas as well. This is not an
ordinary thing. Nevertheless, the visit to Amarlok can’t be
performed with one’s own effort. During the course of its
travel, it appears as if someone else is moving along with.
Mohammad Sahib says—
Chala Jab Lok Ko, Shok Sub Teyagya,
Hans Ka Roop Satguru Banai
Keet Jyun Bhring Ko, Palat Bhringi Karey
Aap Sung Rung Le, Le Udai
When the Satguru turned the Jiva into a Hansa, It left
all sorts of identities and set forth on its journey to Sat
Lok. This is just like the job of a Bhring that turns any
larvae of insect like itself and helps it in flying.When such
a situation arises, the devotee can see in all the ten
directions.
Wherever you fix your concentration, you feel
yourself attracted to that very object. All this is due to the
magnetic forces. But the devotee can’t talk to his Guru.
On the other hand, in the Vihangam chaal-Path of Flight,
the Disciple moves with the Satguru and also talks to him.
The Satguru goes on narrating him about all the places
they pass through. This journey depends on the will. Its


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 19
speed can be decreased or increased at will. Normally this
speed is, indeed, of a very rare kind. None can imagine it.
The devotee moves while visiting all the ten places. When
he reaches the end of the Brahmand, he loses his sense of
discrimination. He finds himself powerless to move ahead.
Beyond this none can go on the basis of his own power.
That is why it is said—
Ra-Rankar Khechri Mudra, Dasvan Dwar Thikana
Brahma Vishnu Mahesh Adi Ne, Ra-Rankar Ko Jana
Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh have a knowledge of
Khechri Mudra (posture). This Mudra has its place in the
10th Dwara (aperture).
None will tell you all these things. You can move
out of your body as and when you desire.
Koyi Koyi Pahuncha Brahm Lok Mein Dhar Maya Le Aayi
Remember! Though only some rare devotees reach
Brahm Lok, yet the Maya, once again, pulls them back.
When the devotee, moving at a fast speed, reaches
the abode of Niranjan, he finds there the light equivalent
to that of 4 crore Suns. This makes him forget himself.
The Mind changes his position in a manner it does so in
dreams. That is why all have said—
Bey Antt... Bey Antt.
There are such kind of pleasures that one loses one’s
sense of discrimination. That is why this abode is called as
Jyoti Swaroop. One can find its mention everywhere. Here
the Satguru absorbs the soul of the disciple within him and
moves ahead.
That body is transparent and the disciple is able to
see each and everything. After crossing the Shunya, the
Satguru separates the soul from him. The disciple asks the
Satguru as to why he had absorbed him within him when
they had travelled a great distance together. The Satguru
says that that the power of Niranjan at that place is so
strong that it could pull him back even though he was


20 Sahib Bandgi
accompanying him. Niranjan would have influenced him.
That is why he had absorbed him in himself.
Clearly, one who says that the devotee can reach
Amarlok based on one's own earnings is a big liar.
Sahib Kabir says—
Kitne Tapsi Tap Ker Darey, Kaya Dari Gara
Grah Chhor Bhaye Sanyasi, Kou Na Pavat Para
Many a worshippers tried hard and even reduced
their bodies to a skeleton. Many of them left their homes
and hearths but still none of them could know these
secrets. That is to say, they couldn’t have any knowledge
of Amarlok. Sahib Kabir says—
Ada Ker Khud Khazane Se, Chhuda Le Apne Bande Ko
O Param Purush! Help your worshiper cross the
worldly ocean.
Na Kuchh Kiya Na Ker Saka, Na Kerne Yog Sharir
Jo Kuchh Kiya So Sahib Kiya, Bheyya Kabir Kabir
Neither I have done anything nor is my body capable
of any such thing. It is Sahib Kabir who has done all for
me.
Next comes the ocean of Surti. It is the ocean of that
very concentration that has been working in our body.
You must think that every job in the universe is being
performed with the power of Surti alone and therein lies
its ocean. The soul is made to take a bath there. It is only
then that the Mind gets separate completely. It is not like
diving in the water. It is the source of indescribable lights.
Within a moment, it seems as if the Soul had emerged out
of it some millions of spins. And when that soul comes
before Param Purush, it gets in it the light of 16 suns.
Then it becomes fully awakened.
After this, whenever the Hansa has to visit there, the
same procedure need not to be followed. The middle paths
disappear. Just imagine the grace of the Satguru. Just
think! Can such a thing happen on the basis of one’s own
earnings. Certainly not, will be the answer.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 21
Q-3) You are talking about the worship of Guru.
**Isn’t it a kind of worship of man? Why shouldn’t we**
worship Param Purush directly?
A.) Rig Veda says—
Guru Brahma, Guru Vishnu, Guru Devo Maheshvar
Guru Sakshat Per Brahm, Tasme Shri Guru Ve Nama
Take the Guru himself as Brahma, Vishnu , Mahesh
and Parbrahm and bow to him.
Suppose, you don’t have faith in the Vedas as well.
and if you are not a disciple, you will naturally think as to
why should one worship a Guru. If you study the sayings
of the holy Sants, you will find that they have not taken
the Guru as God Himself. Had they said so, even then
your argument would have carried no logic and if they had
taken Him as Smaller in status than God, you would have
thought over a little. But they have described the Guru as
greater than God even. After all, there must be some
reason behind it.
' Guru Hain Badey Gobind Se, Mann Dekh Vichaar'
That Param Purush has nothing to do with the
universe. He has handed over the rule of this universe to
Niranjan. He is not in a position to free the Jivas from this
worldly bondage. That is why He has given this job to the
Sant Satgurus. This is a very difficult job that the Sant
Satguru has to perform. You can’t worship Param Purush
directly.
We can fix concentration and can worship one
whom we have seen. However, if we haven’t seen Him,
we won’t be able to worship Him. Such a job is just like
that of throwing stones at the moon. It is totally useless.
Moreover, how can we attain salvation in that case?
It is the Satguru alone who can perform such a job.
That is why he has not been considered as less than God.
Sahjo Bai has beautifully described this situation—
Hari Ko Tajoon, Guru Ko Na Bisaroon
Guru Ke Sum, Hari Ko Na Niharoon.


22 Sahib Bandgi
I am prepared to leave Hari but in no case I would
like to forget the Satguru.
Hari Ne Janam Diyo Jug Mahin,
Guru Ne Avagaman Chhudahin
Hari (God) sent me in this universe but it is the
Satguru who helped me cross the worldly ocean.
Hari Ne Kutumb Jaal Mein Gheri.
Guru Ne Kati Mamta Beri
Hari entangled me in the net of Maya whereas the
Satguru destroyed this net of attachment.
Hari Ne Paanch Chor Diye Satha,
Guru Ne Chhudae Liye Snatha
Hari put 5 thieves ( Lust, anger, attachment, greed
and ego ) with me whereas the Satguru saved me from
their clutches.
Hari Ne Mosey Aap Chhipayo,
Guru Deepak De Tahi Lakhayo
God had hid Himself from me, but the Satguru
helped me see Him with the power of Spiritual knowl-
edge. Sahib Kabir says —
Guru Gobind Donon Khare, Kake Lagoon Panv
Balihari Guru Aapne, Gobind Diyo Lakhae
If both Guru and Gobind are standing before me, I
would touch the holy feet of the Guru who helped me
have a vision of lord.
Let’s move to the basic question as to why we
should worship the Satguru. Should it be taken as the
worship of a human being? Not at all. We shouldn’t take
the Guru as a human being. In his appearance, we should
see the very appearance of Param Purush. I’ll explain to
you this secret.
When the Satguru moves with the Hansa, they first
meet the Sidh Puriyan (A place where there is a display of
miraculous powers). One comes to know as to how one
can kill or cause some other kind of harm to others. The
Soul gets attracted to these. It is just like the case of a


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 23
penniless person whose joy knows no bounds when he
happens to find a huge amount of wealth. However, the
Guru pulls the Soul out of this attraction in a very careful
manner. Travelling in this manner they reach Maha
shunya. Both of them move together. The Guru goes on
explaining everything to the Soul. After reaching the
Mahashunya, the Satguru absorbs the Soul in himself.
Many such Brahmands can be accommodated in that
Maha shunya. 70 kinds of dissolutions are to be found
there. Don’t take Sat Lok as an ordinary thing. Then he
separates the Soul. Still the Soul is far from becoming a
pure Hansa. Here the Soul asks as to why it had been
concealed. Then the Satguru tells it that other than him,
everyone else would be attracted by the powerful
magnetic force of Kaal Purush. That is why he had
absorbed it in himself.
Dear devotees, whatever I have been saying is
nothing but truth. In such circumstances, how can I agree
with the views of one who says that one can cross the
worldly ocean on one’s own. You won’t find all these
things anywhere else. All others are busy in narrating the
Kathas (events contained in the scriptures) but I am
presenting before you pure things only.
After this comes the ocean of Surti. The Guru leaves
the soul of the disciple in this ocean. It revolves at an
amazing speed of millions of times per second. It is just
like the case of devotees who wash their hands and feet
before entering into a temple or a mosque. When the Soul
comes out of this ocean, it becomes a pure Hansa. The
Mind is left behind. Don’t take this Mind as an ordinary
thing. None has the power to separate his Mind.
Next comes a point where the Guru as well as the
disciple appear as two in one. Both seem to possess the
same amount of power. They reach Param Purush. The
latter asks the disciple as to whether he needs Him or the


24 Sahib Bandgi
Guru. There the difference between Param Purush and the
Guru appears the same as that between a lamp and the
Sun. The Soul, as such, is attracted more towards Param
Purush. If the Soul opts for Param Purush, it will remain
for ever in Amarlok. He doesn’t let it absorb in Him. It
will be a quite different thing if the disciple opts for the
Satguru. It will happen only when he has always held the
faith that Satguru himself is Param Purush. Then Param
Purush feels much pleased and absorbs it in Himself.
I have revealed to you a great secret. On sighting
Param Purush the Hansa attains the light equivalent to that
of 16 suns. But when it gets absorbed in Him, it becomes
like Him.
Sab Se Todd Ek Se Jodi, Satguru Tiska Naam.
When it descends on the earth, it has the rare Paras
Surti with it.
Paras Surti Sant Ke Pasa.......
Param Purush asks such a Hansa to go to the earth
and create awakening among the Jivas. Niranjan can’t
even dare touch such a Paramhansa. When the Jivas are
awakened, they will also remain unaffected by the power
of Maya. Such a Paramhansa is called as Satguru.
Then what will the Satguru do? On being blessed
with Naam from such a Satguru, the whole play of Mind
will end. Satguru performs this wonder with the help of
his Paras Surti.
Now it is up to you to decide whether the Satguru
Worship is the same as the worship of a human being or
that of Param Purush Himself.

Q.-4) You oppose the acts of earnings but you
yourself say the devotees should recite the Naam and
should meditate. Those who talk about earnings
merits, also say the same. Then what remains the
difference?
A.) I have never said that the devotees should
perform rites, rituals and other kinds of deeds to the extent
they can, so that based on these they can cross the worldly
ocean.
I have 2 mobiles. I receive many phone calls. The
people phone me even during night hours.
I switch off my phones before going to bed. One
day, I forgot to switch off one mobile. At about 1:30, I
received a phone call. At first I thought of not attending to
it but then I thought it might be of some urgent nature.
When I attended it, the fellow on phone, after saying
Sahib Bandgi, said that he was Lakhvinder. I asked what a
time he had chosen. He said that he had been trying for
quite a long time but was not receiving any response. I
asked what he wanted to say. He said that he was an
employee in some factory and after reaching home he felt
so much tired that he found it difficult to sit in meditation.
I asked him to do so even while moving about. He said
that he couldn’t remember even that much as he had to
work for about 15 hours. He wanted to know whether he
would be able to cross the worldly ocean or would see his
precious life going waste. I advised him to follow the
principles laid down for the Naamis in right earnest. He
said that he had been doing that much with full devotion. I
said that he should rest assured that he will cross the
worldly ocean. He asked why I asked the Naamis to sit in
meditation and recite the holy Naam. What was the
difference between those who did so and those like him
who didn’t do so? I said that he would cross the worldly
ocean receiving the pains of drowning while the others


26 Sahib Bandgi
would straightway cross. Now it was up to him to decide
as to how he would like to go across. Sahib Kabir has
said—
Sumiran Se Sukh Hoat Hai, Sumiran Se Dukh Jaye
Kahein Kabir Sumiran Kiye, Sain Mahin Samaye
Recitation of Naam removes the sorrows and brings
joys and also enables the devotee to get absorbed in Param
Purush.
Sahib Kabir further says—
Naam Na Liya To Keya Bheya, Jo Under Hai Hait
Patibrata Pati Ko Bhaje, Kabhoon Naam Na Lait
What then if one fails to recite the Naam? A lady,
devoted to her husband, worships him even without
speaking his name
The fact is that—
Merey Hari Mauko Bhajein, Main Sovun Panv Pasar
My God recites my name while I enjoy a peaceful
sleep.
Keep safe that which I have given to you. The
Satguru has enabled you cross the worldly ocean.
Remember! If you don’t recite the Naam, the Mind will
try to entangle you in the world. Anyhow, you need not
bother like others about earning of merit-Punya.
Satya Naam Nij Aushdi, Satguru Dei Bataye
The Satguru has told you about the herb in the form
of the real Naam.
So if you don’t recite the holy Naam, make sure you
don’t fall in the grip of Mind. I explain everything at the
time of blessing with Naam. I have done within moments
that which couldn’t be done even after spending years
together in caves.
Koti Janam Ka Patth Tha Guru Pall Mein Diya Pahunchae
The Guru helped in covering within moments the
path that couldn’t be covered in even countless births.
Others talk of making earnings whereas I talk of
keeping safe the wealth I have given to you. You will find


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 27
all your tasks getting accomplished in an unbelievable
manner. It is your duty to make others as well have a
knowledge of all this. Your worldly attachment will go on
fading and the Mind will, so to say, salute you. You can
fix your concentration at anything you like. You will find
everything well in your control. Believe me, even while in
family, you are living the life of a sage.
Jo Koyi Kahey Ki Main Kiya To Dhani Sahey Ga Maar
He who boasts of having accomplished on his own,
will receive the unbearable thrashing.

28 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-5) What is the difference between a Guru and
a Satguru?
A.) Guru can at the most have knowledge of the 3
Lokas (Jagatguru) whereas the Satguru has the knowledge
of the 4th Loka as well. A Guru blesses with the Nsam
related to Sagun or Nirgun method of worship whereas the
Satguru blesses with the Naam related to the true and real
form of worship related to Param Purush. A Guru simply
shows the path without doing anything for himself and the
disciple has to make his own earnings whereas the Satguru
not only shows the path but also himself helps the disciple
reach Amarlok.
A Guru has no knowledge of Param Purush whereas
a real Satguru not only has knowledge of Him but also
actually descends on the earth after getting absorbed in
Him. A Guru at the most has a knowledge of the 10
dwaras whereas a Satguru has the knowledge of the 11th
(Surati) Dwara as well. The Naam blessed by the Guru is
a worldly one and can be spoken, read as well as reduced
to writing. It is related to the body. However, the Naam
blessed by the Satguru is related to the Soul and is not a
worldly thing. That is why it neither can be spoken nor
can be read or reduced to writing. A Guru has no power to
impart the true knowledge related to the Soul whereas a
Satguru has the power to give. A Guru can show the path
that can help a devotee attain the 4 kinds of salvation
related to the 3 Lokas. He does not know the technique
that can help one attain the real salvation- Param moksh.
On the other hand, a Satguru reveals the real form of
salvation that saves the devotee from the cycle of repeated
births and deaths. This happens with the mere grace of the
Satguru. Knowingly or unknowingly, the worldly Guru
shows the path related to Niranjan but, after a brief period
of unreal salvation, the devotee will have to take birth
again and bear the tortures of Niranjan as before.

meditate on one whom he has not seen, whereas
Meditating on true Satguru will provide all help and
protection to a being and will also provide Permanent
Salvation-Param Mukti.


30 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-6) What are the basic principles of your Dharma-
Righteous conduct?
A.) There are 7 principles laid down in our Panth.
The Namis are given a knowledge of these at the time of
blessing them with Nam. These have to be followed in
letter and spirit. These are—
1.To speak the truth.

2. To live on righteous earnings.
3. To refrain from taking intoxicants.
4. To refrain from consuming meat.
5. To refrain from gambling.
6. To refrain from committing theft.
7. To refrain from adulterous life.

Q.-7) What will happen if one fails to follow these
principles after getting blessed with Naam?
A.) The devotee who doesn’t follow even a single
principle, has to face punishment. Don’t think the devotee
will receive punishment only after I come to know of it. It
will be like an automatic process. Disregard in any form
will invite punishment. It doesn’t mean the punishment
will be given at that very time. It can be spread over a
number of days. This is the concession a Naami can hope
to get. The punishment depends on the nature of wrong
done. In my life I have given a big punishment to two
offenders.
I forbade them from coming to me again. Moreover,
they lose the power to fix their concentration on me. This
is the last and the final punishment a great spiritually
enlightened sage awards. Then all doors of forgiveness
are closed. It is equivalent to irrevocable death penalty.

Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 31
Q.-8) These principles are hard to follow. It is not
possible for the common man to follow these. Then
how to follow these?
A.) At the time of blessing with Naam, the power to
follow these was also are given. As long as you have not
blessed with Naam, you are in the grip of Mind. And it
makes you dance to its tune. However, after blessing you
with Naam, your Soul will be separated from your Mind.
Then the Soul will not be under the grip of Mind, even if
it desires to do so. The Mind will not end but you will be
can exercise your power on it. In such situations, you will
be saved from doing wrongs. The power of Naam will
continue to guide you on the right or wrong of things.
Still if you commit the wrong, you will have to face
punishment. Without Naam you are not in a strong
position to judge whether some particular act is wrong or
not. The Mind tactfully involves you in committing wrong
acts. But, it will be unable do so after you get blessed with
Naam. The power of Naam will, under all circumstances,
bring reforms in you. In short, it will be easy for you to
follow the principles if you keep your concentration fixed
at your Satguru. This concentration will not let the Mind-
Maya to keep you in their grip.

Q.-9) What is the proof of the fact that the power
of Nam will make it easy to follow these principles?
A.) You can check our Naamis. Try to make a dis-
tinction between their previous and the present life style.
Excepting those who are not observing the principles in
letter and spirit, you won’t find such people anywhere
else. An impartial study will give you the needed proof.
*************************

Q.-10) What kind of Naam do you possess?
A.) This is called as the Sar Naam. It is a rare kind of
Naam that is altogether different from those of the 52
alphabets. At the time of blessing with Naam, the Sant
Satguru awakens the power of Param Prush present within
you. Then, taking your Soul within him, he once again
places it in your body. This is the main action that
separates your Mind from your Soul. It is this very activity
that is called as blessing with Naam-Naam Dhaan. That
Naam is Param Purush Himself. It remains with you at all
the times to guard you, to turn you into a Hansa, to save
you from the grip of Kaal Purush and Mind-Maya and to
take you to Amarlok. In short, the Satguru Gives you the
company of Sat Purush Himself in the form of Sar Naam.
Otherwise, there is no power that can save the Jiva from
the grip of Kaal Purush.

Kaha Na Jahi, Likha Na Jayi. Bin Sarguru Koyi Nahin Payi.

be spoken nor reduced to writing. None can know of it

Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 33
Q.-11) Why and where do you ask the devotees to
fix their concentration?
A.) We are talking about fixing the concentration on
the Ashtam Chakra. The Yogis move up to the Saptam
Chakra. These 7 Chakras lie within the body itself
whereas the eighth Chakra lies at a height of one and one
fourth of a hand above the head. This will make you
realize that you are without a body (Maya) as well.

Q.12) Whose worship are you preaching?
A.) We give the worship of Param Purush. All the
Souls are a part of Him. His abode is in Amarlok that lies
far beyond the 3 Lokas. He is the same Param Purush
whom Kaal Purush worshipped hard to get blessed with
the rulership over 3 Lokas along with innumerable Souls.
The same Param Purush who, on hearing the painful cries
of the Jivas, sends Kabir Sahib in the guise of a Sant to
free them from the clutches of Kaal Purush. He doesn’t
take back all the Jivas forcefully because he is bound by
the word He has given to Kaal Purush in this regard.
That is why He has to adopt the technique of taking
them back in a phased manner.

34 Sahib Bandgi
Q.- **13) Why don’t you perform the Sagun** and the
Nirgun form of worship?
A.) Both- Sakar and the Nirakar- kinds of worship
are perishable. All the things made out of the 5 material
elements are called as Sagun or Sakar. All of us know that
the 5 material elements are perishable but still, none gives
a serious thought to the fact that even element Sky is
included in the 5 elements and it is Nirakar. As such, the
worship of Nirakar is nothing but the worship of the
perishable element.

Q.-14) Are you a Kabir Panthi?
A.) No, we are not Kabir Panthis. The Kabir Panthis
make the world move around Kabir Sahib whereas I make
it move around me. If Kabir Panth is taken as Oil, The
Sahib Bandgi should be taken as the refined Oil. If the
former is taken as Butter, the latter should be taken as
Ghee. The Kabir Panthis don’t believe in the status of a
Satguru. They seem to forget that Sahib Kabir had sung
not in his own glory but in the glory of the Satguru. As
such, we are not Kabir Panthis. However, we take his
sayings as a matter of evidence. Otherwise, a real Sant
Satguru has no need of that. Nevertheless, the people
won’t believe so easily, if I speak on the basis of my own
experiences only.
That is why I have to quote him as and when needed.

Q.-15) Is your Matt a Sant Matt?
A.) No, our Matt is Bhring Matt, it is not a Sant
Matt.

Bhring Mata Hoye Jehi Pasa, Soi Guru Satya Dharamdasa|
While giving the secret of Satguru to Dharamdas, Sahib
says- that one who has the Bhringa mata is a real Satguru.

```
Q.-16) What about this Bhring Matt?
```

Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 35
A.) There are 27 Lakh varieties of insects to be
found in the world. Among them it is the Bhring that
possesses rare virtues. It is male and has no female. It
makes a house out of mud. It can fly at a great speed. It
has a magic in its sound. It catches any insect and taking it
in its house it whispers its sound into its ears. With its
charming sound it turns the insect like itself. However, it
can’t do so if the insect doesn’t listen to its sound. After
moving about, it again comes to whisper its sound in its
ears. If again it fails to turn the insect like itself, it flies
away and after taking a round, makes the third and the
final attempt. If the insect listens to its sound, it turns in to
a Bringa, but if it doesn’t coperate then the Bhring lets it
go. The latter remains as an insect like before. It fails to
become another Bhring. Then the Bhring moves in search
of some other larve and repeats the same process on it.
The Satguru also performs the same kind of work.
He makes the disciple like himself with the power of his
Paras Surti. The insect has to do nothing at all. It is the
Bhring itself that catches the insect and brings it to its
abode. Putting it down it whispers its word into its ears.
The insect has only to show its willingness to listen to the
word. What can the Bhring do if the insect doesn’t listen?
In this regard Sahib Kabir has said—
Bhringi Shabad Keet Jo Jana, Varan Phair Aapan Ker Jana
The insect that listens to the word of the Bhring,
loses its previous identity and becomes like the Bhring
Itself. That is to say, it will lose its previous nature and
behavior.
Koyi Koyi Keet Param Sukhdai, Pratham Aavaz Gahe Chitlai
Some good-natured insects listen to the very first
sound and become like the Bhring.
Koyi Dooje Koyi Teeje Maney.Tann Munn Rahit Shabad Hit
Janey.
Some insect listens to the sound in the second at-
tempt while some other listens to it in the third attempt.


36 Sahib Bandgi
Bhring Shabad Keet Na Gahei To Puni Keet Asre Rahei
However, the insect that doesn’t listen to the word
out of fear or otherwise, remains as an insect as before.
Guru Shabad Nishchaya Satya Maney, Bhringi Matt Tab Pavei
Taji Sakal Aasa Shabad Basa, Kaga Hans Kahavei
A disciple becomes a Hansa only if he takes the
words of the Satguru-(Paramhans) as truth and truth alone.
The Satguru turns the crow like nature of such a disciple
into that of a Hansa. In fact, the words of the Satguru are
soothing like those of the Bhring. All that is needed is
firm faith and devotion.
Pahle Data Shishya Bheya, Jin Tann Munn Arpa Sheesh
Peechhe Data Satguru Bheya, Jin Naam Diya Bakhshish.
The disciple is the first donor who offers his body,
mind, and possessions at the holy feet of the Guru whereas
the Satguru is the second donor who blesses the former
with Naam.
All others are talking about the easy path but they
are talking about the earning merits as well. Sahib Kabir
says that the disciple need not do anything. Rather, it is
the duty of the Satguru to do all that are needed; spiritual
knowledge, devotion, control over mind, and other related
things will automatically come to the disciple.
This wonder is performed with the power of the
Satguru. Therefore, devotion matters not ego. Some one
asked me if everything goes on with the grace of the
Satguru, it means the acts of cheating are also done with
his consent. I asked him to listen to me patiently. A
devotee, who is in complete surrender to the Satguru, can
in no case do any wrong act. You will reap the reward as
per your Karmas (deeds) if you behave under the sway of
nature and Mind. If you deliberately try, fall in a well, you
will definitely fall into it. However, the Satguru saves the
real devotee from such misfortunes by turning the tide of
Karmas.
Koti Karam Pall Mein Katey, Jo Aawe Guru Oat.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 37
Countless Karmas of a devotee who seeks the shelter
of a Satguru, get washed away in a moment.
The Guru will come to your rescue as and when he
foresees any misfortune approaching near. All that will
happen, will go in your favor. That is to say, it is the Guru
who has to decide as to what is right or wrong for you.
Surti Karau Mum Saiyan, Hum Hain Bhavjal Mahin
Aap Hi Hum Bah Jayen Ge, Jo Na Gaho Ge Bahin
O Sahib! We are in the midst of deep waters. Keep
your merciful attention on us or else we shall get drifted
away.
There are many Gurus in the world who say they
will take the devotees across the worldly ocean of death.
However, on watching their followers one finds that their
nature remained unchanged. That is to say, they are not
the real Gurus. Sahib Kabir has cautioned the devotees in
this regard. He says —
Bhrang Mata Hoye Jihi Pasa, Soyi Guru Satya Dharam Dassa
O Dharam Dass! Take only that Guru as real who
has the power to turn the devotee like himself in a manner
the Bhring does

So Fera Sab Miti Gya, Satguru Ke Upkar.
Listen and know that without a Satguru there is no one to
take you accross this Worldly Ocean of Life and Death.
None else can help free from four types of birth, only by
the grace of a living Satguru one attains Param Moksh

Q.-17) What is the difference between the Yog
Matt and the Sant Matt?


38 Sahib Bandgi
A.) Yog is just like the Bhog (satisfaction of the
organs). Just as a Bhogi derives pleasures related to the 5
Indrias (sense organs), in the same manner, a Yogi derives
the pleasures after fixing his concentration at 5 different
places. This pleasure is related to the subtle tissues/cells.
However, these pleasures are about a thousand times
greater than those derived through Bhog. The pleasure in
Bhog is related to a particular organ whereas the pleasure
in Yog is related to the 10th Dwara.
A great difference between the Yog Matt and the
Sant Matt is that the Yogi can move out of the 10th Dwara
and can wander in the abode of Niranjan's worlds but he
remains within his limits. He takes the abode of Niranjan
as Sat Lok. On the other hand, a Sant moves out of the
11th Dwara after breaking the barriers of Niranjan and
reaches the real Sat Lok (Amarlok). This 11th Dwara lies
within our Surti itself.
Nau Dware Sansar Sub, Dasvein Yogi Sadh
Ekadish Khidki Bani, Janat Sant Sujan.
Dasvein Dwar Se Jeev Jub Jayi, Swarg Lok Mein Basa Payi.
Geyarvein Dwar Se Pran Nikasa, Amarlok Mein Paye Basa.
In Yog Matt the Naam is related to the body. That is
to say, it is given to the perishable body by the perishable
body of the Guru. On the other hand, the Sajeevan Naam
blessed in Sant Matt it not related to the body. That is to
say, the Satguru blesses this Naam through his Surti into
the Surti of the devotee.
That is why the Satguru at first catches hold of the
Surti of the disciple by keeping his hand over his head and
then after separating it from the Mind, he blesses the Soul
bypassing Mind with his Surti. In Yog Matt, the act of
blessing with Naam is done by recitation because it has
nothing to do with the Surti. The disciple listens to these
words with his ears and begins to recite the same. Such a
Naam can be written and read-out. However, the Naam
blessed in Sant Matt has nothing to do with the spoken


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 39
words. The Yogis fix their concentration through Chachri,
Bhuchri, Agochri, Unmuni and the Khechri Mudras that
are directly linked to the body centres.
In the Sant Matt the concentration is fixed at a height
of one and one fourth of a hand above the head. Out side
Body-Maya.
Jaap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mer Jaye
Surti Smani Shabad Mein, Vako Kaal Na Khaye
Recitation by mouth and inward recitation will
perish but the Kaal won’t be able to destroy the Surti that
is present in the Naam itself. The Naam the Sant Matt
talks about is nothing but the Soundless Sound. There are
no audiable sounds or the musical notes to be found.
In Yog Matt the disciple has to make earnings-
through meriterious actions, while in Sant Matt the
disciple gets everything simply by the grace of the
Satguru. Unlike the Yog Matt, in Sant Matt the act of
creating awakening in the Surti is performed. In Yog Matt,
much importance is not attached to the Guru whereas in
Sant Matt the Satguru is the sole doer.
Moreover, in Yog Matt the Meen and the Papeel
modes of sadhana are practiced while in Sant Matt it is the
flight-Vihangam mode that is followed to reach Amarlok.
Kahain Kabir Vihangam Chal Hamari.
Sahib Kabir says that he follows the Vihangam
mode. Through Yogic practices a devotee can attain many
kinds of miraculous powers but he fails to attain the
spiritual knowledge. Many Yogis on attaining these
powers become egotists as well. However, in Sant Matt,
the ego vanishes on attaining the spiritual knowledge. In
Yog Matt it is Niranjan who is considered as the ultimate
reality whereas the Sant Matt speaks of that which lies
beyond the universe of Niranjan.

Q.- **18) Doesn’t the worship of any deity mean** one and
the same thing?


40 Sahib Bandgi
A.) No, it cannot be taken as the same thing.
However, those who think it as the same thing give
arguments in favor of it. They are true so far as the
worships related to Niranjan are concerned. The Sagun
worship is related to Niranjan and the same is true in case
of Nirgun worship as well.
Niranjan had three sons—Brahma, Vishnu and
Mahesh. Then there were the branches as well as the sub
branches that made the whole of Brahmand. As such, the
worship of those other than Niranjan himself, also falls
within the limit of Niranjan. As the whole of universe has
been created by Niranjan, so all kinds of worship being
practiced here are related to him at levels.
At all the places- scriptures he has talked about
himself and his structures alone. The secret related to
Param Purush and Amarlok are consealed and not
revealed in any Religious Scripture. After departure from
the world, every Jiva reaches the deity he worshiped. For
instance, the worshipper of Shiv Ji reaches Shiv Lok, the
worshiper of Pitars reaches ancester Lok and the like.
Nevertheless, one should understand that at the time
of great dissolution, the worshipers of both Sagun as well
as the Nirgun – will reach Niranjan. Even other deities
will get absorbed in him. However, the worshipers of
Satguru will escape from Niranjan's grip and will attain
Amarlok, whether such a thing happens in their life time
(Jeevan Mukta) or after their departure from the world.
Mann He Niranjan, Mann He Onkaar, Mann He Hai Kartara.
Jeev Ke Sang Mann Kaal Rahai, Agyani Narr Jaanat Nahin.
Mind himself is Niranjan, Mind himself is Onkaar, Mind
himself is the Ruling Power of the Universe .The Lord of
Death of every being resides with him but ignorant human
being is not at all aware of this truth.

Q.- 19 ) Are you against the Surti Shabad Abhiyas?


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 41
A.) No, we are not against anything. We simply say
that these musical notes are not Param Purush. We can
speak only when two elements - Air and Earth - interact.
You will feel a strange kind of echo in your ears if you
press your teeth or hands tightly. It happens due to the
activity of nerves.
All this is related to the movement of our body. This
will no longer remain as truth when the body gets
destroyed. That is why we talk about Surti Yog and not
about Surti Shabad Abhiyas.
Jaap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mer Jaye
Surti Smani Shabad Mein, Vako Kaal Na Khaye

Q.-20) What is the word you are talking about?
A.) First we have to understand that the word we are
talking about is neither Varnatmic (Alphabatic) nor
Dhunatmic (Sound) nor any musical note. It is very differ-
ent from the 70 kinds of musical notes emanating from
within the body.
That is to say, it is Muktatmic Word (Soundless
Sound). There are no Musical notes in it. In short, it is
altogether different from every word to be found or
understood in the World.

Koti Naam Sansar Mein, Tin Te Mukti Na Hoye.
Mool Naam Jo Gupat Hai, Janey Birla Koye.
There are crores of ‘Naams’ in the world. Nevertheless,
these can’t help us achieve salvation. On the other hand,
the true Naam is a hidden one and only some rare sants
have it.
Kaha Na Jahi, Likha Na Jayi. Bin Satguru Koyi Nahin Payi.
The holy sants clearly say that the true Naam can neither
be spoken nor reduced to writing. None can know of it
without a living Satguru

```
Q.-21) What does this Sar Naam stand for?
```

42 Sahib Bandgi
A.) This Sar Nam is not an ordinary thing. Whole of
the world is talking about Naam but none has any
knowledge of this Sar Nam. Regarding it Sahib Kabir
says—
Satya Shabad Satya Purush Jano.
Naam Bina Sub Jhut Bakhano.
Everything other than Sajeevan-Sar Naam is unreal
and among the Naams it is the Sar Naam alone is Satya
Purush Himself.
After their separation from Satya Purush, the Souls
got entrapped in the prison of Niranjan. He didn’t let any
of them escape to Amarlok. He tied the Jivas in the net of
Sin and Merit. Reaping the reward of their sins or merits
in hell or heaven, the Jivas began to wander in the cycle of
84 Lakh Yonis. In this mortal world, after suffering untold
tortures in these 84 Lakh Yonis, the Jivas were given the
human birth. However, even in this human birth too the
Jivas were made to suffer much. This birth was, in fact, an
opportunity for the Jiva to use it for attaining Permanent
salvation. The Jivas could reach up to Niranjan alone. This
is because there was none to impart them the knowledge
about Amarlok. As such, no Jiva could reach Amarlok.
Niranjan began to eat all the Jivas after roasting
them on a hot slab. He began to torture them in a variety
of ways. Once, When Niranjan was busy in eating the
Jivas , the latter cried aloud. They prayed in a body to
God, if there is any, to save them from the tortures of
Niranjan.
The painful cries of the Jivas crossed the seven skies
and reached Param Purush. He understood everything. He
called the Geyani Purush (Kabir Sahib) and telling him
about the cruelties of Kaal Purush, asked him to go and
save the Jivas from his clutches.
Ker Parnam Geyani Chaley, Karan Hans Ke Kaj


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 43
Sahib Kabir offered salutations to Param Purush and
decended to free the Jivas from the clutches of kaal
Purush.
Sahib Kabir comes in to the world of Niranjan in
every Yuga to free the Jivas. When he came to the
universe for the first time (by the name ‘Satsukrit’), he
remained there for one hundred years. Nevertheless, he
failed to take any Jiva with him.
When Param Purush asked him the reason for not
bringing any Jiva, he replied that one whom he made the
idea clear in the morning, forgot all about it in the evening
and one whom he made the idea clear in the evening,
forgot about it in the morning. Then Param Purush handed
over to him a hidden thing (Sajeevan Naam ) saying Kaal
will be unable to exercise any influence on one who
would get blessed with it.
***********************************
Q.-22) Is it a sinful act to seek the shelter of some
other Guru after shunning the first one?
A.) No, it is not so. If you find that your Guru is not
a Sant Satguru, Shun him and go in search of some perfect
Guru. There is nothing wrong even if you have to shun
more of such incomplete and imperfect Gurus.
Jabb Takk Guru Miley Nehin Sancha,
Tabb Takk Guru Karo Dus Pancha
You can seek the shelter of more than one Guru by
the time you succeed in finding some perfect Guru.
However, it is sin to speak against the previous
Gurus. In fact, finding a true Satguru for seeking
liberation of the soul is really a great noble job.
Ja Guru Te Bhram Na Mite, Bhranti Na Jiv Ka Jaye.
So Guru Jhootha Janiye, Tyagat Der Na Laye.
A Guru who cannot remove the illusion and delusion, is a
false Satguru, leave him.


44 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-23) What things has a devotee to bring with
him for seeking shelter?
A.) Te seek the shelter of a Satguru for attaining
Param Purush, there is nothing in the universe that you
can offer. All that is needed is firm faith and devotion in
your Satguru. It is the Satguru, not you, who can offer
anything.
Guru Sman Data Nehin, Yachak Shishya Sman
Teen Lok Ki Sampda, So Guru Deeni Daan
There is no great beggar than the disciple and no
great donor than the Satguru who offers him in charity all
the wealth to be found in the 3 Lokas.
**********************************
Q.-24) After getting blessed with the Naam
related to Sahib, do the deities cause any kind of harm
for ignoring them.
A.) None can do any harm to the disciple. None has
ever said that earlier he was the worshiper of Hanuman Ji
and now after taking to the worship of Param Purush
(Sahib ), Hanuman Ji had come to attack him with his
Guraj ( the metal weapon he carries with him ). None of
the followers of other deities has ever complained of any
such thing.
Devi Deva Jagat Mein, Kotin Pooje Koye
Satguru Ki Pooja Kiye, Sub Ki Pooja Hoye.
There are crores of Gods and the Goddesses in the
universe. Nevertheless, the fact remains that in the
worship of the Satguru lies the worship of all.
There was a grain of rice in the house of Draupdi.
She offered the same to Krishan Ji. All the Rishi Munies
felt they had no more appetite. Otherwise, there was not
sufficient food in her house to satisfy the hunger of all.
This was the miracle of Guru. Life is short and even
countless births will appear less if one remains entangled
in bringing all the deities round. In such a case when will
one attempt to seek Salvation? In the worship of the


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 45
Satguru lies the worship of the whole of Brahmand.
Remember! All the Gods and the Goddesses even bow
before the worshiper of a Satguru. You might have
watched in TV the Gods and the Goddesses offering
flowers to the true worshipers in a graceful manner.
Frightening others in the name of the Gods and the
Goddesses has become the job of selfish persons.
A goat lost its way in a forest. It could fall a prey to
any beasts of prey. It went straightway to the lion and said
that it was in his shelter. The lion agreed to it and said that
none would dare to do any harm to it.
The lion called his ministers including the bear and
the like and asked them to make an announcement in the
forest that the goat belonged to the lion and as such, none
should dare to touch it. Now the goat began to graze in the
forest in a carefree manner. In the same manner, none
would dare to do any harm the one who worships Param
Purush.
We are not against any Religious Scripture. The
Shastras present all that is related to Niranjan. The Vedas
say—
Dheyan Moolam Guru Roopam,
Pooja Moolam Guru Padkam
Manter Moolam Guru Vakyam,
Moksh Moolam Guru.
Fix concentration at the appearance of the Guru,
worship his feet, Take the words of the Guru as Mantra,
and his very grace as Salvation.
Teen Lok Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Bada Na Koi.
Karta Kare Na Kar Sake, Guru Kare So Hoye.
Satguru Deen Dayal Ji, Tum Lag Meri Daud.
Jaise Kaag Jahaj Par, Sujhat Aur Na Thaur.
Satguru will not direct you to work on spiritual exercises,
Sadhanas. Satguru is a compassasnate Savior and Guide
who help you cross this worldly Ocean of Life. There is
none, who equals him in these three worlds


46 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-25) Performing the worship of Satguru causes
loss to Niranjan. As such, he can cause harm.
A.) The Soul has been in the imprisonment of Niran-
jan since ages together. Niranjan has treacherously misled
through the Mayaic net spread by him. Otherwise, neither
Niranjan nor Maya have the power to catch hold of the
Soul. So to say, the Soul itself has caught hold of the
Maya.
Niranjan could not do any harm to the Soul since
ages together. It has remained as before. After getting
blessed with Sajeevan Naam, the power of the Satguru
also gets added to it. The Naam guards the soul as well as
the body in which it is present. Then the reverse happens.
It is Niranjan who begins to feel afraid. This is because he
realizes that now onward he won’t be in a position to play
with it.
He makes all possible attempts to prevent Jiva from
worshiping the Satguru and to remain engaged in his own
worship as before. So you need not feel afraid in any way.
He will oppose the Satguru through his own worshipers
and will tease his followers in other ways. Therefore, the
real fight is with Niranjan alone. It is the worshiper of the
Satguru who emerges victorious in the long run. The
devotee of the Satguru enters Amarlok stepping on the
Niranjan's head.

Guru Bin Bhav Nidhi Tarhin Na Koyi,
Hari Biranch Shankar Samm Hoyi.
Tulsi Dass ji says that none can cross the worldly ocean
without the guidance of a Guru even if he be equivalent to
Brahma, Vishnu or Shiva.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 47
Q.-26) Why we **shouldn’t recite the Na** am using
beads? Why should we do so through the breath
alone?
A.) If we recite it with the beads, our attention will
remain in the beads and when the last bead appears, our
attention will also get diverted to it. The tongue will
remain busy in reciting the Naam and the Munn will find
an opportunity to run away.
Manwa To Chahun Disha Phirey, Yeh To Sumrin Nahin
What kind of a recitatation we can call it when the
Mind continues to wander in all the four directions.
The Mala (collection of beads attached with a
thread) is related to the Mind whereas the recitation is
related to the breath. The recitation through the breath
means recitation through every pore of the body. In the
breath itself lies our soul and the breath reaches every
pore of our body. As such, it will mean the recitation with
soul as well. That is why the enlightened souls, Sants have
advised us to do recitation in the breath (Soundless with
Surati).
Swans Swans Prabhu Sumir Le, Britha Swans Na Khoye
Na Janey Kis Swans Mein, Aawan Hoye Na Hoye
Don’t waste your breath. Use every breath in reciting
the Naam as none knows whether he will be able to take
the next breath or not. Guru Nanak Dev Ji says ;-
Swansa Di Mala Naal Sumiraan Tera Naam.
I would recite your Naam with the beads of breath.
Remember! When the Munn escapes, the Surti as
well will escape and the recitation will become
purposeless. Another benefit of recitation through breath
is that it opens the Sushumna nerve. It will create
awakening and you will get absorbed in inward
meditation.
Jap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mari Jaye.
Surti Samani Shabad Mein, Usko Kal Na Khaye.


48 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-27) What message have the holy sants given?
A.) The real Sants have given to the world the mes-
sage related to Amarlok that lies beyond the 3 Lokas.
They have said that the Lord of 3 Lokas is Kaal Purush
who, acting against the wishes of Param Purush, has
imprisoned the Souls in bodily cages. They give the
message of the worship related to Param Purush. This
method of worship is different from the worship preached
by the Vedas and the Shastras. Moreover, they ask the
Jivas to seek the shelter of the Satguru who would help
them return to their original abode. He would do so after
blessing them with Sar Naam.
Chall Hansa Tu Desh Hamare, Satguru Dait Pukara Hain
Satya To Kewal Amarlok Hai, Jhuta Yeh Sansara Hai
The Satguru gives a call to the Hansa to return to his
country ( Amarlok ) which, unlike this unreal world, is the
real and eternal one.

Q.-28) Do a large number of Sants descend on the
earth at a time to liberate the Jivas?
A.) No, this is not necessary. Param Purush gave
Niranjan this universe to rule for a period of 17 Asankhya
Chaukri Yugas as boon. So all the Jivas are not to be
liberated at the same time. That is why the Sants don’t
descend on the earth in groups. The universe is not to be
made uninhabited and barren. A single lion is enough for a
forest. In the same manner, a single Sant is enough to take
all the Jivas across the worldly ocean. However, he uses
technique to remove the misconceptions of the Jivas and
take only those ones to Amarlok who appear to be
awakened.
It happens in two ways. Either the Jivas make
themselves fit for His grace and recognize the Sant
Satguru or the Sants themselves shower their grace on
them out of delight.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 49
Q.-29) Many Panths and Matts follow the
teachings of the Sant **s. Aren’t the** Sants to be found
there?
A.) Even a layman can read and recite the sayings of
Sahib Kabir. He can even follow their teachings. There is
nothing bad in it. However, the fact that remains to be
seen whether he can reach his original abode Amarlok or
not. In fact, Niranjan had requested Sahib Kabir to allow
him to float 12 Panths in his name. That is why even
though some talk about Sahib Kabir yet, inwardly,
knowingly or unknowingly, they worship Niranjan. All
this is due to ignorance on their part. Niranjan had asked
for these Pants to simply to mislead Jivas so that only a
small number of them can reach Amarlok.
If Sahib or the Sant Satgurus so desire, they can take
all the Jivas at once to Amarlok. Nevertheless, those who
have love for the world, have not to be taken. After all,
Niranjan is the son of Sahib. Niranjan had asked Sahib
Kabir if all Jiva who worshiped Sahib could reach
Amarlok, the world would becme uninhabited and barren.
In that case he was also ready to go back to Amarlok.
Otherwise, he should make the world barren or he should
let him misled and entangle the Jivas. Sahib Kabir had
accepted his request and this has been the main reason of
misconceptions among the Jivas.
Dooidash Panth Kaal Permana
Bhule Jeev Na Paye Thikana
The jivas misled by the 12 Panths of Kaal are at a
loss to distingish the real path from false one.
Therefore, it is important for the Jivas to assess
whether the Naam they are going to be blessed with, is the
Sajeevan Naam and soundless or is related to the Alphabat
and has to be recited by mouth.


50 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-30) How to recognize the real Sant, from the
ever growing crowd of Sants?
A.) Sahib Kabir has described in detail the char-
acteristics of a true Sant. You should check these. Firstly,
he shouldn’t be engrossed in Maya. He shouldn’t be a
family holder. In case he had entered into a family life, he
should have deserted it after becoming enlightened and
should have devoted his life for the good of the Jivas. If
you keep these things in mind, you won’t commit any
wrong in finding out the true Sant. Just Imagine! He
whose soul has been absorbed in Param Purush has to take
all the Jivas like his children. Then how can the question
of leading a family life arise? Still, if such a Sage decides
to enter into a family life, take it for granted he is
absorbed in Maya and hasn’t reached the spiritual heights.
A real Guru who is spiritually enlightened, will never get
absorbed in Maya even if he desires to do so.
In the Vedas and the Shastras we come across many
instances when the great Rishi Munies, under the impulse
of lust or anger, committed many wrong acts. What was
all this? It was a clear proof of the fact that their limit was
up to Niranjan. They were unable to pierce the clouds of
Maya and reach Param Purush. That is why the Satguru
who reaches Param Purush remains safe from the net of
Maya and his devotee who gets blessed with Nam from
such a Satguru, remains safe from maya.
Other characteristics are —

1. He should live on his own earnings. If he depends
   on the offerings of the disciples or lives on begging, he
   can in no case be called as a Sant.
2. He should have the needed knowledge to clear the
   misconceptions of the disciples.
3. He should be free from all sorts of worldly
   relations. If he is not so, then he will work for them and at
   the time of departure he will hand over the Guru Gaddi to
   one among his relations and as per the preveiling trend


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 51
the worldly people will start worshipping his heir taking
him as a Sant.

4. He should be a follower of truth. There is nothing
   greater than truth in the eyes of the Sants.
5. He should be impartial in his behavior.
6. His soul must be absorbed in Param Purush. Only
   preching with bookish knowledge about Param Purush
   and His Amarlok to others can’t serve the purpose.
**********
Q.-31) You say that the Gods and the Goddesses
**shouldn’t be worshipped. Isn’t it an act of con** demning
them?
A.) The first thing to note is that the people here
have misrepresented the meaning of the Gods and the
Goddesses. I asked my Namis why there were less
temples in the names of the Gods and the Goddesses.
Brahma, Vishnu and Maheash are called as the Tridevas.
Then why do the people say we are speaking against their
worship? The Namis told me that first of all here the
Hatya of the deceased person is observed as per the
prevalent rites and then that very fellow is taken as the
God. I mean to say the people are not worshipping the
Tridevas even.
Let’s turn to the basic question. Among the Vedas
the Rigved is considered as the oldest one. It says 'Eko
Brahm dutia nasty' There is only one God.
The people have a great faith in the Gita. There
Vasdev Krishan tells Arjun in no uncertain terms that the
worshipper of Pitars goes to pitar Lok, the worshipper of
the gods goes to Dev Lok while the worshipper of the evil
spirits attains the Prait Yuni after his departure from the
world. As such, leaving all sorts of other modes of
worship he should worship him alone. He said so because
he was the Guru of Arjun. Would you call this as well an
act of denunciation? Worship of any deity is not wrong. It


52 Sahib Bandgi
is a fact that a devotee finds the virtues and the powers of
the deity he worships. However, the basic purpose of
worship is to seek liberation. At this point, all seem to
agree that —
Guru Bin Geyan Na Upje,Guru Bin Mitey Na Dosh
Guru Bin Lakhe Na Satya Ko, Guru Bin Miley Ne Moksh
None can attain the spiritual knowledge without the
grace of the Guru and none can free himself from the sins
without his grace. In fact, it is the Guru who shows the
path of Truth and enables the disciple attain liberation.
That is why Vasdev Krishan has spoken in favor of the
worship of a Guru and this is what we have been saying.
Two things Devotion and Faith are required in the field of
worship. Devotion is polluted when it is divided on more
then one. In such a case, the faith will vanish and there
can be no devotion without faith and no worship without
devotion.
Just as a wife does not want that her husband should
have love for any other woman and the husband does not
want that his wife should have love for any other man, in
the same manner, God doesn’t want that His devotee
worship any other deity then Him.
For instance, if a devotee goes to some other person
for finding relief from his sufferings, he does a sort of
insult to his Guru or God. Such a behavior is a clear
indication of his lack of faith in his Guru or God.
Moreover, it reflects that he thinks some other person as
more powerful than his Guru or God.
Similarly, for attaining salvation if the disciple goes
to some other person ignoring his Guru, it is a clear
indication of the fact that he underestimates the power of
his Guru. In this regard, he is right in doing so if his Guru
really has no power to give him salvation, but if the Guru
has the power to do so, then the disciple shows disgrace to
him.
Paltoo Sahib says —


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 53
Bada Hoye Tehi Poojiye Santan Kiya Vichar
The sants after giving a good thought have said that
only one, who is great in Spiritual knowledge, should be
worshiped.
He has also said that with the lamp of tualism in
hand they began the search for finding such a great soul.
Out of the 33 crore Gods they found out three _ Brahma,
Vishnu and Mahesh. Even out of these three they found
Vishnu and Mahesh as great. However, they selected
Vishnu (Hari) whom they thought could help the devotees
in attaining salvation. Further, with the help of that very
lamp they found Hari in-between the virtues like Satgun,
Rajgun and Tamgun. However, the Sants are beyond the
reach of these Virtues.
Now it is up to the devotee to decide as to whose
worship he should do. Paltoo Sahib has tried to bring to
light that none in the entire Brahmand is greater than the
Sants and as such it is they who deserve to be worshipped.
That is to say, the stress is on the worship of the
Competent Guru. It should not be described, as an act of
denunciation. It is rather, an attempt to explain as to what
a devotee can attain from the worship of different kinds of
deities.
The devotee will have to worship Param Purush if he
desires to attain salvation and the medium for this worship
is the Satguru. You cannot worship Param Purush as you
have not sighted Him.
The worship of the Gods and the Goddesses will
keep you within their limit. It is not the worship of Param
Purush. However, the worship of the Satguru is taken as
the worship of Param Purush because He is within him in
an awakened state.
Still, if you are engaged in the worship of any other
deity, you are under misconception.
Q.-32) Is Salvation necessary?


54 Sahib Bandgi
A.) Necessity is the mother of invention. This uni-
verse is an abode of sufferings and sorrows. All have been
imprisoned here. Moreover, a prisoner cannot remain in a
state of joy and pleasure. From the very birth, one has to
face sufferings and sorrows. The child has to suffer a lot
for 9 months in the womb of the mother. Then there is the
filth of bags of urine and stool. Further, it remains
entrapped in a narrow path. Then after taking birth, a new
line of sufferings and sorrows makes its appearance. It
receives the thrashing from one or the other. Sometimes, It
has to suffer from one or the other bodily problem. On
other occasions, it feels sad if it fails to get the desired
thing or loses that which it had. These sorrows and
sufferings remain with him even when he grows young or
old.
That is to say, sufferings and sufferings alone found
here.
Yogi Dukhiya Jangam Dukhiya, Tapsi Ko Dukh Doona
Aasa Trishna Sub Ghat Veyapat, Koyi Mahal Na Soona
Here even the Yogis, Jangams and the Tapsi
(worshipers of different deities) are seen suffering from
one or the other kind of sorrow. Different kinds of desires
continue to haunt them. None seems to be safe from these.
Then there is the sorrow of death. All those who
helped us in one way or the other are seen leaving the
world one by one. There is also the sorrow of passing
through different kinds of Yonis as per one’s Karmas.
These include many dirty and hateful Yonis like that of
dog, mosquito, cockroach, pig and the like. Who would
take these as pleasures?
God (Param Purush) can never give such troubles to
His own Souls-parts. He, rather, remains worried about
freeing them from such sad plight.
When the holy sants give to the people the message
of Param Purush, people do not take them seriously. The


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 55
worldly people seem to have nurtured a liking for this
very world.
Main Kheenchat Hoon Sat Lok Ko, Yeh Bandha Yampur Jaye
I pull him towards Sat Lok but he goes to Yampuri
bound in chains.
Salvation is necessary for escaping from the tortures
of Kaal.

Q.-33) How many kinds of salvation are there?
Which kind of salvation have the Sants talked about?
A.) In the Holy Scriptures, 4 kinds of salvation have
been mentioned. These are—Salokya, Sameepya,
Saroopya and Sajujya. Salokya means the attainment of
Pitar Lok. Sameepya means the attainment of heaven.
Saroopya means the attainment of Brahm Lok while
Sajujya means the attainment of the Nirakar.
Mukti Mukti Sub Jagat Bakhana, Mukti Bheid Na Kau Jana
Whole of the world seems to be talking about sal-
vation but none could know the secret related to the real
form of salvation.
Those engaged in Sakar (Formful) worship; attain
the heaven or the Pitar Lok. They think they have attained
salvation. The worshipers of Nirakar (Formless) attain
Brahm Lok or Nirakar Lok. They too think they have
attained salvation. Nevertheless, the secret of salvation
can be understood only when we study the sayings of the
holy Sants.
In all the above-mentioned Salvations, there will be
rebirth in this mortal world after a brief stay in their
respected Lokas/heavens.
The Soul will attain the real Salvation only when it
frees itself from the 3 Worlds of Niranjan and reaches
Amarlok from where it never returns to the earth.
The Sagun worship is of a very limited nature.
Suppose we have to go to America, a matador or a bus
will not serve the purpose. As such, it cannot help us


56 Sahib Bandgi
attain Sat Lok. Such worshipers are, however, born in
some high family. However, if they happen to commit
some wrong Karmas, they will have to pass, once again,
through the cycle of repeated births and deaths. They
endure disease or others handicap in one way or the other,
attain the human birth after passing through the cycle of
84 Lakh lower Yonis. Whereas the noble persons attain
the human birth, in the prosperous homes after their
period in heaven ends.
Anyhow, this much is certain that the Karmas —
good or bad—can’t help us attain the real Salvation
through the medium of these kinds of worship.
Those who don’t want to absorb themselves too
much in worship, perform the Sagun kind of worship. In
addition, those who go deep, take to the Nirgun kind of
worship. They pay attention to meditation and Yoga.
Their level is somewhat higher. They attach significance
to 5 kinds of Mudras. However, they too have their limit
up to Nirakar only.
The Yogis keep their beards and matted hair and
carry a Trishool (a metal weapon with three pointed ends)
in hand. The Jangams decorate their head with a crown of
peacock feathers. The Sanyasis wear Bhagwa (a mixture
of red and yellow) colored clothes. They are clean-shaven.
The Vairagis-renounceate wear a necklace round their
neck, Andhave keep long beard and hair, they carry a
Kamandal (a special vessel) in hand. The Sevdas wear the
necklace of Rudraksh and put ash on their bodies.
The Nirgun worshipers do not take birth for Lakhs
and crores of years but after every dissolution, when the
earth again regains its form, they have to take birth
repeatedly.
Pap Punya Ye Dono Beri, Ek Loha Ek Kanchan Keri.
Kabir sahibji is saying that both bad deeds and good
deeds are like the links of a chain which is used to bind


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 57
the Soul. The only difference is that one is made of iron
and the other is of gold.
That is why Sahib kabir has talked about the true
kind of worship where the Souls do not take birth again
and again. This worship is much different from the Sagun
as well as the Nirgun Kinds of worship. These 3 Worlds
will perish. Kabir Sahib and other Sants have talked about
Amarlok (Eternal world) where no dissolution takes place.
That is a rare abode. When our Shastras and other holy
scriptures agree that the soul is immortal, then it is but
natural that its abode must Eternal. Then alone it can be
called as the real and true. This is because—
Satya Sohi Jo Vinshe Nahin
Truth Is That Which Never Perishes.

Q.-34) What is Mind?
A.) It is the Son of Param Purush who has been cre-
ated by Him simply by the uttering of a sound. He turned
out to be a bad Son who has continued to torture the Souls
that are the very part of Param Purush.

Q.-35) What is Maya- Illusion?
A.) It is Adhya Shakti herself (First Female). She is
the daughter of Param Purush who, like Niranjan, was cre-
ated by Him. In relation, she is the Sister to Niranjan but
out of fear of Niranjan she has been staying with him as
his wife. She helps Niranjan in every way so far as the
question of entangling the Jivas in the Mayaic net and
preventing them from reaching Amarlok is concerned. She
gives the bodily form to keep the Jivas entangled in her
maya (Illusion-Nature).
Yeh Pinjra Nahin Tera Hansa, Yeh Pinjra Nahin Tera.
Sahib Caution that the body in which you are residing
does not belong to you and in reality is a cage, which
belongs to the Mind.


58 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-36) What is soul?
A.) It is the Part of Param Purush and has his
essence. It is not created. All those, that has been created,
have to perish. However, the Soul, like Param Purush,
neither been created nor will ever perish, eternal.

Q.-37) When everything perishes one day? Who
will escape from the dissolution?
A.) Yes, one day, everything will perish. The sun,
the stars, the moon etc. will also perish. A day will come
when even the Heavens of Brahm, Niranjan (Formless),
Maya (Devi) and even Niranjan will perish. However,
there will remain the One alone (Param Purush) Who,
neither has been created nor will ever perish.
Aadi Sach Yugadi Sach Hai Bhi Sach Nanak Hosi Bhi Sach
That reality will remain forever. It has been true
since yugas together. Moreover, the Souls too will remain
eternal, as they are the parts of Param Purush (Eternal
Supreme Being).
Koyi Na Rahe Ek Purush Lok Rahega

Yeh Sansar Kal Hai Raja, Karam Ka Jal Pasara.
Sahib Kabir asks the Humanity "O Hansa! leave this
Kaal's worlds of Karmas (deeds), let’s move to the
Amarlok, where Param Purush resides".
Amarlok Hanson Ka Dera,
Param Purush Jahan Karein Basera.
The real abode of a Soul is ‘Amarlok’ where Supreme
Lord Himself resides.

Q.-38) God is called as the Lord of all. He is
called as the Lord of all the Brahmands as well.
**So,isn’t the world we are living in, in his hands? If not,**
then who is the Lord of this universe?
A.) The world we are living in, is the place which
Param Purush, on being pleased with the worship of
Niranjan, gave him to rule. As such, now Param Purush
doesn’t interfere in the affairs of this universe. Now this
place is under the sway of Kaal Purush alone.

Q.-39) Are we not being looked after by God?
A.) No, all of us are in the hands of Niranjan who
labored hard for 204 Yugas to get blessed with the
rulership of 17 Asankhya Chaukri Yugas ( over
the 3 Lokas. Though he is the Son of Param Purush, yet he
has turned out to be a dirty Son. Just as you turn out your
Son and even sever relations with him if he stops
behaving as a dutiful Son, in the same manner, Param
Purush ousted His Son Niranjan from Amarlok on account
of his evil and wrong deeds. Nevertheless, he had got
blessed with the rule over the 3 Lokas and also had got the
Souls as well.
Now he has been torturing the Souls of Param
Purush by imprisoning them in the bodily cages.
The Salvation the world has been talking about is
nothing but Salvation from the imprisonment of Niranjan.
A little thought will enable you know that you are not
under the care of the real God. Had it been so, you
wouldn’t have to suffer from so much tortures. None can
even think of giving so many tortures to his children.

Jeev Padda Bahu Loot Mein, Na Kachhu Laen Na Daen.
The Soul is entrapped in the net of Karmas. It has no
concern with any of the Karma, and nothing to gain or
lose in this moral world.


60 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-40) Do all reach the same place after leaving
this world?
A.) No, One reaches at the abode of one’s deity. We
can know in two ways about the abode one attains after
departure from the world. The Karmas they performed
give us a lot of information about it. If the one lived a
noble life, didn’t torture anyone and worshiped some or
the other deity, he would find a place in the heaven. If he
was engaged in the worship of ancestors and did noble
deeds, he would attain Pitar Lok.
If he has done evil and sinful deeds, he would go,
straightway, to hell. If he had been performing Yog along
with doing noble deeds, he would attain either Brahm Lok
or Niranjan Lok, depending on the Mudra he had
practiced. On the other hand, if one is blessed with
Sajeevan Naam from a Satguru, and worshiped him, he
would attain Amarlok.
Then everyone who departs from the world, leaves
some indication about his whereabouts. At this, Sahib
Kabir has said—
Mall Dwar Se Jeev Nikasa, Narak Khani Mein Paye Vasa
If the prana (Life Breath) escape from the anus, the
being attains hell. As an indication of it, the stool of the
deceased will come out at that time.
Nabhi dwar se jeev jab jayi, jalchar Yuni mein pragtai
If the prana escape from the navel, the Jeev will
attain the Yoni of the water dwellers like fish etc. As an
indication of it, the urine of the deceased will come out.
Mukh dwar se Jeev jab jayi, Ann khani mein vasa payi
If the prana escape through the mouth, the Jeev will
attain the Yoni of the insects that feed on grains. As an
indication of it, the mouth of the deceased will remain
wide open.
Swans Dwar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Andaj Khani Mein Vasa Payi


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 61
If the pranas escape through the breath, the Jeev attains
the Yoni of the birds etc. As an indication of it, the filth
from the nose of the deceased will come out.
Netar Dwar Se Jeev Jabb Jayi, Makhi Aadi Tann So Payi
If the prana escape through the eyes, the Jeev attains
the Yoni of a fly, mosquito etc. As an indication of it, the
eyes of the deceased will remain wide open.
Shravan Dwar Se Jeev Jab Chala, Prait Deh Paye Tatkala
If the prana escape through the ears, the Jeev, at
once, attains the Yoni of Spirits of neither worlds. As an
indication of it, the body of the deceased will have a
fearful appearance.
Dasham Dwar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Swarg Lok Mein Vasa Payi
If the prana escape from the 10th dwara, the jeev
attains heaven. As an indication of it, the face of the
deceased will give a pleasant look.
Ranbh Dwar Se Jeev Jab Jayi, Amarlok Mein Vasa Payi
If the pranas escape through the 11th dwara, the Jeev
attains Amarlok. It remains forever in the abode of Param
Purush and never returns to this mortal world. As an
indication of it, the Jeev will appear to be sleeping. Also,
it will appear as if it may get up at any moment. So to say,
it will look peaceful.

Q.-41) Where does the 10th dwara lie and how
can it be opened?
A.) The 10th dwara is not to be found at some
particular place. It is a state of being. Had it been present
at some particular place, the scientists would have told
about it since long and also would have succeeded in
opening it with their very small and delicate instruments.
However, nothing of the sort has happened.
That State attained by transcending all the three
states —Sushupit, Swapan and Jagrit` (Deep sleep, Dream
and Awake). In the awakened state, it is the
Karamendreyas (Organs of action) and Jnanendryas


62 Sahib Bandgi
(Organs of senses) that function. All the actions are
performed with the help of air movement in the body. This
air has been directed from the navel-Manipura. From
where have we been receiving this air? The air is present
in the atmosphere. The basis of our awakened state is by
this very air. We breathe even during our sleep. It means,
one need to move out of this very breath. Man breathes
through the Ida and Pingla nerves. This breath enters into
the navel automatically. It is just like the water that flows
from the higher level to lower level. From the navel the
breath divides into 10 parts. These parts perform different
kind of jobs like hearing, walking, applying force and the
like.
In order to stop the supply of air, the Sushumna is
opened by closing the Ida and Pingla. Then the whole
physical system ceases to function. The 10 different kinds
of air are drawn together from the body by concentration.
Because of it, the organs stop performing their respective
functions. This stage is also called as Shunya Samadhi.
Reaching this stage is not an ordinary thing. For this,
one has to move out of the awakened state. The Ida has to
be absorbed in Pingla so that the air, instead of moving
down in to navel, moves upward.
Ulta Jaap Japa Jab Jana, Balmik Bhaye Brahm Smana
Valmiki became Brahm like only after reversing the
airs in the upward direction.
The Mind will try to create all sorts of hurdles but
the devotee has to keep the concentration fixed. This is
because the direction of the breath can be reversed with
the power of concentration alone. The breath has got
accustomed to move towards the navel. As such , the body
doesn’t get emptied all of a sudden. The Mind, in a very
clever manner, tries to divert our attention. It will make us
remember some incidence that has no connection at all
with our present concentration. That is why the guidance


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 63
of the Guru is needed at each step. In this way our Mind
has closed the 10 dwara.
Sushman Madhya Basey Niranjan, Moonda Dasvan Dwara
God-Niranjan has occupied the place in the Sushman
nerve and has thus closed the 10th dwara.
Gaflat Nehin Tahan Hosheyar Dekhna
Not laziness but it is the alertness that is needed
there.
Tiktaki Chand Aur Chakor Ki Lagi Rahe
The concentration like that of a Chakor ( a bird ) for
the moon is needed.
All our labor will be lost if we allow our con-
centration to deviate for even a moment.
Tahan Silhali Gail, Chadoon To Gir Gir Padoon
That is a very slippery place. That is to say, it is a
very uphill task. One can fall at any moment.
The Activity of the Mind never stops. It makes us
remember only such things as irritate us much. The
devotee who doesn’t fall a prey to the tricks of the Mind,
begins to understand its moves. If you continue your
journey, you will be able to experience your Soul. This
state is called as the Turiya state where the Mind prevents
the devotee from entering. In short, by default it doesn’t
let anyone enter into the inner world.
Munn Cheenhe Koyi Birla Yogi
Only some rare Yogi can understand the Mind.
Remember! It is the breath that has made the Soul
feel itself like a body. Therefore, the devotee has to move
overcome this breath.
Marte Marte Jug Moa, Maran Na Jana Koye
The worldly people have been dying but none knows
what the real state of death means.
Nanak Dev Ji says—
Jeevat Mariye, Bhavjal Tariye
Salvation during the very lifetime makes one cross
the worldly ocean.


64 Sahib Bandgi
Just see! The devotee wants to escape but the Mind
motivates him to remain entangled in the world itself.
No problem will appear before concentration. There
is warmth in the breath. That is why the body becomes
cold after death.
In short, The breath and the Surti (Concentration)
have to become one. When the whole body reaches that
state of cease, a sense of fear overtakes the devotee. At
first, it will appear as if the hands have stopped
functioning and then it will appear as if death is
approaching. The Mind, in a clever way, will instill this
very thought of death in the mind of the devotee. When
the devotee thinks he is really dying, he thinks of
postponing the idea of fixing concentration to some other
date. It is not an easy path. After this, the jiva reaches
Shunya and then the 10th dwara opens.
Sheesh Utare Bhuin Dhare, Taper Rakhe Panv
Kahain Kabir Dharma Dass Se, Aisa Hoye To Aav
Sahib Kabir says that only a devotee, who crushes
his ego, can accompany him.

Q.-42) Where does the 11th dwara lie and how
can it be opened?
A.) The 11th dwara lies within the Surti. It can’t be
opened through any Yog, Yagya, hard worship and the
like. This is because the practices like Yog can help only
in awakening our cell centers and have no role in the
awakening of our Soul. That is why it can be performed
by a perfect Guru alone. At the time of blessing with
Naam, he separates the Surti from the Mind and creates
awakening in it. This grace makes the task easy for the
devotee.
**Q.43) If one can’t reach** Amarlok on the basis of
Yog, Yajya, hard worship and the like, then where did
our ancient Rishi Munies who worshipped hard for
**years together, reach? Didn’t they attain salvation?**


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 65
A.) It is only the Satguru who has the power to take
the Jivas to Amarlok. Our Rishi Munies could reach only
up to the limit of Niranjan because those practices can
take us to that limit alone.
Q.-44) Your devotees take you as the incarnation
of Sahib Kabir. What is the proof thereof?
A.) It is the duty of the disciple to take his Guru as
the very appearance of God. I have never said that I am
Sahib or it is I who have been doing each and everything.
I have never said such a thing for myself. I have said for
Sahib alone. Whenever some devotee comes to me with
some problem, I always ask him to have faith in Sahib. I
never ask them to have faith in me for the solution of their
problems. If the disciples believe in any such thing, it
speaks of their faith. They have a right to say so. Sahib
Kabir has said that in Kal Yug as well, he will again
appear on the earth and will float a Panth to enable a large
number of Jivas attain salvation.
Jambu dweep than baithai, dehi paan tabb Panth chalayi
I shall appear near the continent Jambu and will float a Panth.
None has complete knowledge of the teachings of
Sahib Kabir. Only a Sant can understand the meaning
inherent in the sayings of other Sant. In my sayings, you
will find quotes of Kabir Sahib. I have made the devotees
understand the message of Sahib Kabir. That is why my
disciples express similar views. Neither I have to speak of
my greatness nor I have to shake the faith of the disciples.
It is up to you to make any opinion in this regard.
Paras mein aur Sant mein, tu bado antaro maan.
Voh loha kanchan karey, yeh karlein aap samaan.
There is a big difference between a Paras (a touchstone)
and a Saint (Sant). Paras can only transform an iron into
gold but not into paras. Whereas, a true Saint transforms a
human being alike Himself just through His supreme
concentration.


66 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-45) What is the greatest job in the world?
A.) The greatest job in the world is to attain
realization of the Soul.

Q.-46) What is realization of Soul?
A.) Soul realization implies realizing the Soul as
different from the Mind. Entire world and all relations are
due to the Mind alone. All that man has engaged in the
world is nothing but falsehood. This is because it is the
Mind that has been motivating him for the same. Mind,
intellect, Consciousness-remembrance, and ego are the
different forms of Mind. It has cleverly entangled the Soul
in these. Mind remains busy in expressing desires; the
intellect remains busy in taking decisions; the
consciousness helps in recalling the past incidences and it
is ego that helps man perform all sorts of activities.
Moving across the limit of these four forms and
laboring to know the pure awakened Soul is called as
realization of Soul.

Q.-47) Wherefrom has Niranjan got the power to
imprison the powerful parts of Param Purush?
A.) Niranjan meditated on Param Purush for a period
of 204 Yugas. None in the entire Brahmand is more big
worshiper than him. He is very powerful. He would have
become stronger and would have tortured the Jeevas more
and more, had Param Purush not prevented him from
meditating on Him by hurling a curse. However, he is the
5th son of Param Purush whom He created like other Sons
simply by uttering a word. None has the power to catch
hold of the Soul. None can imprison it—be it Maya or
Mind. On the contrary, Soul has caught hold of Maya.
Mind in a very tactful way entangled it in the Mayaic net.
This is the reason behind its imprisonment.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 67
Q.-48) Is it Niranjan who causes dissolution?
A.) Yes, This job is performed by Niranjan. Param
Purush has nothing to do with all this. All sorts of
dissolutions—big or small—are caused by God-Niranjan.
Some think, God has given them Salvation. Actually it is
not so. He who has been killing all, can in no case be
expected to give salvation to anyone. His sole job is to kill
the Jivas, to eat them and then to give birth to a new
creation.

Q.-49) How does great dissolution take place?
A.) The elemental destruction of the earth is called
as dissolution. The sun, the moon and the stars don’t get
perished. However, when the great dissolution takes place,
not only the earth gets perished but all the planets come
near each other. Sometimes the Sun will appear at night at
12 o’clock. The planets will start moving in the reverse
direction and will even go out of control. As a result, they
will start colliding with each other. Great explosions will
take place in the solar system due to the collision of the
planets at terrible speed of Lakhs of Kilometers per
second.
The earth will experience great jerks. As a result of
it, the water waves will rise up to a height of 100 Km.
Water and water alone will appear all around. The water
will destroy the earth. Earth is made of water and will get
absorbed in it. Then the Sun will destroy the water. The
air will put an end to the power of the Sun. It will happen
in a manner a lamp gets extinguished when blown out.
After this, the sky will absorb the air in itself. When a
house gets destroyed, some rubbish is left behind but
when the world gets destroyed, not even a pin is left
behind. It is Nirakar God alone that is left behind. He ,
once again, creates the universe. This is the Nirakar God.
The Vedas as well talk about it.


68 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-50) What happens after the great dissolution?
A.) Whenever Niranjan causes great dissolution, the
whole of Brahmand gets destroyed. He absorbs all the
planets within him. Nothing like heaven, Pitar Lok and the
like is left behind. Then , taking all the Souls with him, he
goes near the Amarlok. He can’t enter it. He prays to
Param Purush to take back all the souls saying he is not
interested in creating the universe again.
He receives the order to create the universe again as
he received the boon for the same. As such, he goes on
creating repeatedly. When the universe is created again, it
is the air that appears first. Then, fire from the air, water
from the fire and finally earth is created out of water. This
process of creation and destruction goes on.

Q.-51) If all the Souls of Param Purush are not
sinful, for what fault have they been imprisoned in the
painful bodies in this world full of sorrows and
sufferings?
A.) Though Param Purush has given the Souls to
Niranjan on account of his hard worship, yet He has put a
safety cover over them. Kaal Purush can do no harm to
them. Param Purush had not given the permission to put
the Souls in bodies. Doing so, Niranjan has disobeyed
Param Purush and has been reaping the fruit of it. It is
Niranjan and not the Soul that suffers from the tortures.

Q.-52) If there are no bodies, no material
elements in the Amarlok of Param Purush, there
should be no Guru or Satguru as well. Then how can
we take Him as the only truth and to what an extent is
it right to meditate on Him?
A.) It is true that there are no 5 material elements in
Amarlok, no bodies made out of these, no Guru or the
disciple but we haven’t to talk about such things here.
When a criminal appears before the judge, he has to bow


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 69
for fear of punishment. In the same manner, a devotee has
to bow before a Satguru, because it is he who has the
power to take him out of the prison of Niranjan. One
won’t find the physical body of the Satguru there but the
Satguru, after absorbing himself in Param Purush,
assumes His appearance and enters into the physical body
to make us understand all this. That is why he has to be
considered as greater than Param Purush Himself and has
to be worshiped. As far as the question of fixing of
concentration is concerned, it is the eyes where the
concentration has to be fixed. This has to be done during
meditation. In the awakened state that God element is
present in the eyes. That is why this concentration can’t be
called as the material one. It is, so to say, the act of fixing
concentration at Param Purush. That is why are advised to
look into the eyes of the Satguru while performing
salutations. Looking into the eyes means to have a vision.
As you don’t know His real appearance, you are not in a
position to understand this secret. A Satguru comes to the
world as per the will of Param Purush to liberate the Jivas.

Q.-53) Should the appearance of a Satguru in
dream be taken as truth or a dream?
A.) Normally, the Satguru doesn’t appear in dreams.
If he appears, take it as true.

Q.-54) Do those who die an unnatural death, as-
sume the appearance of evil spirits?
A.) No, it is not so. Even after death, they remain as
they were in their very life time. If they lived like devils
during their life time, They will be found like devils after
death as well. Likewise, the great ones will remain as
great. They remain like that without bodies.


70 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-55) Why and when does one attain the human
body?
A.) One attains the human body after passing
through the cycle of 84 Lakh Yonis (Lower life forms).
This Soul wanders in the 84 Lakh Yonis. These Yonis
have been divided into four Khanies (species as per their
habitation and Birth etc.). The Jivas who live in water, are
called as water dwellers. Those who live under the earth,
are called as Ukmaj. It takes 75 Lakh years to shift from
one Khani to the other. That is to say, it takes 3 crore
years to complete the cycle of 84 Lakh Yonis. It means,
one attains the human birth after such a long time. This is,
in fact, the opportunity to seek Salvation. In no other
Yoni, except that of a human being, one can hope to attain
Salvation.

Q.-56) Why has the soul been thrown into the 4
Khanis?
A.) There are 5 material elements in the human
body. It has the greatest amount of Consciousness in it.
Man has the power to remember a great many things. This
body is full of knowledge. If one were lucky enough to
attain the human body repeatedly, one could remember the
past lives and taking the world as an abode of sufferings
and sorrows, one would have thought of attaining
Salvation. It is on account of its passing through different
Yonis, that the Jiva forgets everything related to its past
lives. Other Yonis have no element of knowledge.

Panch Sakhi Piyu Piyu Karat Hain, Bhojan Chaht Nyari Nyari.
All the five senses in our body are continuously seeking
their respective pleasures

Q.-57) What kind of abode is Sat Lok?
A.) As such Sat Lok is Param Purush Himself, so it
is not possible to give a description of it.
Ved Kateb Paar Nehin Pavat, Kahan Sunan Se Neyara Hai
Even the Vedas and the other religious scriptures
don’t have a knowledge of it. It is a rare kind of abode.
Jahan Jaye Phir Hans Na Aawe,Bhavsagar Ki Dhara
The Hansas after reaching there don’t come again to
the mortal world.
There is no light of the Moon, the Sun and the Stars.
There are no days and nights even. There is no existence
of the 5 material elements, the net of worldly relations,
hunger, thirst, sorrows and pleasures, diseases and
problems etc. that are related to the body alone. These are
not to be found there because there are no physical bodies.
further, there is no such problem like that of high and low,
Caste, religion and the like. That abode is the most
beautiful of all. Its beauty and splendor can’t be described
in words. The beauty of the 3 Lokas fades before it.
Pind Brahmand Ko Tahan Na Lekha,
Lokalok Tahvan Nehin Dekha
Aadi Purush Tahvan Asthana,
Yeh Charittar Eko Nehin Jana
There is no existence of the body, Brahmand and the
abodes —big or small. None knows that, that very Loka is
the abode of Param Purush.
Apahi Kanda Taul Taraju, Apahi Taulan Hara.
Apahi Leve Apahi Deve, Apahi Hai Banajara.
Apahi Guru Puni Shishya Apahi, Aap Aap Ka Khel Hai Sara.
Kabir sahib says that the Supreme Lord Sahib is the
balance, He is the weight and He is the one who is
weighing. He is the one who gives, He is the one who
takes and He is the vagabond. It is He who is the Guru, it
is He who is the disciple, and all of us are in your scheme
of things


72 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-58) What is the form Param Purush have?
Can we get to know it?
A.) He is indescribable. Even one who has sighted
Him Can’t give any description. Still, Sahib Kabir has
given some hints for the common people to have a bit idea
about Him.
Koti Anant Yojan Lau Kaya, Kahan Lug Kahon Tasu Ki Chaya
You can imagine His body to have a spread up to
innumerable Yojans. So to say, He is limitless
Koti Kalap Yug Jaye Sirai, Mukh Anant Se Varni Na Jayi
It is not possible to give a description of Him even if
an attempt is made to speak for Yugas together with
innumerable mouths.
Then talking about the forehead he says that if it is
taken in a very subtle form, it will appear like innumerable
suns and moons. It is not possible to give a description of
his brilliance.
Abb Netran Ko Kahon Pramana,
Mano Anant Bhan Shashi Jana
Suppose He has eyes as well. Then these can be
taken as innumerable Suns and Moons. It appears as if
billions of lights have put together.
Nasa Roop Kahun Prachanda, Mano Ajj Anant Brahmanda.
Again, suppose He has nostrils as well. These appear
like countless Brahmands from where the strange kind of
fragrance is spreading up to many Yojans.
Shravan Roop Main Kahaun Bakhani,
Anant Sindh Mano Smani
Suppose He has subtle ears as well. These appear to
have countless seas in them with innumerable Lotus
flowers (having no branches, leaves, roots etc.) blooming
there. It is not easy to describe the beauty of all this.
Abb Mukh Shobha Kahun Bakhani,
Pind Brahmand Tehi Mahin Samani.
Nau Shunya Jahan Lug Basa,
So Mukh Bheeter Keenha Nivasa


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 73
Suppose He has a subtle mouth as well. The entire
limit up to the 7 shunyas is to be seen in His mouth.
Purush Roop Ka Barnan Bhai, Barnat Yaney Na Hoye Dithai
His appearance is indescribable. It is a futile attempt
to describe His beauty.
Purush Shobha Agam Apara, Mukh Anant Nehin Pavey Para
Even the countless mouths can’t describe His charm.
Chikur Shobha Kahun Bujhai, Koti Ravi Sheesh Rom Lajai
Kotin Chanda Soor Prakasha, Ek Ek Rom Anant Bhasa
Again, suppose He has hair. Every pore can put
crores of Suns to insignificance.
Shavet Akar Purush Ko Unga, Phatakvarn Dehi Ko Runga
He has a white appearance. There is nothing like this
world to be found there.
In the worldly language, that Sahib has the
appearance in the form of word and light, .But this word
and light are entirely different from those of this world.
Jahan Lug Jeev Boond Hai Bhai,Tako Bhaid Kahaun Samujhai
Take the countless Souls as droplets, then Param Pu-
rush as a mighty ocean of nectar.
This description is based on supposition because that
invisible God is of a very rare kind. He has made His
appearance from the medium of brilliant white light.

Q.-59) Who can attain the shelter of a Sant
Satguru?
A.) This happens only after one performs noble
deeds for many births. The time for the liberation of the
Soul approaches and it seeks the shelter of the Satguru.
sometimes the Sants themselves give their blessings. The
Sants are the doers in the holy Durbar of Param Purush.
Even Sahib Himself acts as per their dictates. They have
freedom to do what they like. They can take anyone they
like to His abode.


74 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-60) What is the significance of having the
vision of Guru?
A.) The Sant Satguru have a treasure of spiritual
powers that are very much needed by our soul. None can
attain this treasure without the blessings of the Satguru.
When we go to the Sant Satgurus, we receive this
energy in three ways (Dharsan, Sparshan and Sambhasan).
Firstly, when they look at us, we receive the spiritual
energy present in their eyes. That is why we request them
to have their gracious look at us. Secondly, we receive this
energy through their words. That is why great significance
is attached to Sat Sangs.
Dhanya Ghari Jab Ho Satsang
Blessed is the moment when one happens to attend
the Satsang.
Thirdly, we receive this energy through touch.
However, out of respect it is advised to touch the feet
only.
That is why so much significance is attached to the
auspicious sight-Dharsan of the Satguru. We should
continue to have their holy vision when they happen to be
near us.
Keyi Baar Na Hoyi Sake, Doyi Vakat Ker Leyi
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Kaaldaga Nehin Deyi
If you can’t find time to have the vision many times
a day, you can do so at least twice a day. It will make you
safe from the onslaught of Kaal.
Doye Vakat Ne Ho Sakey, Din Mein Karey Ik Bar
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Utre Bhavjal Par
If you can’t do so twice a day, you can do so at least
once a day. A devotee who sights the holy vision of the
Satguru, crosses the worldly ocean.
Ek Din Na Kari Sakey, Dooje Din Kari Le
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Pavey Uttam Deh.
If you are not in a position to have his Dharsan once
a day, you can do so the next day.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 75
This is just like the case of our body that grows
somewhat weak if we don’t take the food for the whole
day. However, our weakness gets removed when we take
the food the next day.
Dooje Din Na Kari Sakey, Chauthe Din Ker Jaye
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Moksh Mukti Phall Paye
You can have the vision on the fourth day if you are
not in a position to do so on the second day. A devotee
who does so, attains salvation.
The energy received from the Satguru even on the
4th day would prevent the Mind from gaining control over
the soul.
Mata Pita Sut Istri, Bandhu Kutumb Ko Jaan.
Gurudarshan Ko Jabb Chaley, Yeh Atkave Aan.
Unka Atka Na Rahey, Guru Darshan Ko Jaye.
Kahai Kabir So Sant Jann, Moksh Mukti Phall Paye.
The parents, Son, Wife and other relations will cause
hindrance in the path when the devotee desires to go for
having the Dharsan of Satguru. Sahib Kabir says that the
devotee shouldn’t stop and should proceed on his way.
Such a devotee is sure to attain salvation.
Just as a tree derives all the needed energy from the
earth but still it needs one kind of energy. This energy is
that of the Sun. In the same manner, one may achieve as
many miraculous powers through Yogic and other such
like practices as one likes, but he can’t cross the worldly
ocean on the basis of these very powers alone. For this, he
will have to receive the spiritual energy from the Satguru.
The Naam blessed by the Satguru is the basis of
spiritual power. The Jeeva can’t cross the worldly ocean
of life and death without it. The vision of the Guru makes
this energy grow. We can receive this energy through
meditation as well. However, more amount of energy can
be received when the Guru is very much present before us.
Meditation is done only as an alternative to vision. During
meditation, we try to fix the form of the Guru. However,


76 Sahib Bandgi
we can receive this energy directly when the Guru is
before our eyes. As such, we should not close our eyes
when we find the Guru before us. There is no need to do
meditation at that time.
Vaar Vaar Na Kari Sake, Pakshe Paksh Karey Soye
Kahai Kabir Ta Dass Ka, Janam Safal Ho Jaye
He who is not in a position to have the vision once a
week, can do so once in every fortnight. It will make his
life purposeful.
Pakshe Paksh Na Kari Sakey, Maas Maas Karu Jaye,
Ya Mein Dair Na Laiye, Kahain Kabir Samujhaye
If the disciple finds it difficult to have the vision
once in a fortnight, he can do so once a month. He
shouldn’t make any delay in doing so.
Maas Maas Na Kari Sakey, Chhate Maas Albatt
Ya Mein Dheel Na Kijiye, Kahain Kabir Avigatt
If due to some unavoidable circumstances the
devotee is not able to go for having the vision of Satguru
once a month even, he can do so at least once in every six
month. Sahib Kabir says that he shouldn’t show any
laziness in this regard.
Any laziness in this regard would make the Mind
gain dominance over the Soul and the Individual will
begin to do many sorts of wrong acts.
Chhate Maas Na Kari Sakey, Baras Dina Kari Lehi
Kahai Kabir So Sant Jann, Yamhin Chunauti Dehi
If some devotee is not in a position to have the vi-
sion of his Guru even once in six months, he should do so
once a year at least. If he does so, he can pose a challenge
to the Yama as well. That is to say, he can attain salvation.
However, the devotee who fails to do even this
much, is a very unlucky, indeed. He shouldn’t hope to
attain salvation.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 77
Q.-61) Will Niranjan, the torturer of the Beings,
ever perish? Will all the Jivas ever attain permanent
Salvation?
A.) Yes, One day Niranjan will perish. However, it
will take some time. This is because he has been blessed
by Param Purush to rule over the 3 Lokas for a period of
17 Asankhya Chaukri Yugas (.
47 Lakh years make 4 Yugas and 4 Yugas make one
Chaukri Yuga. 10 Sankhya Chaukri yugas make one
Asankhya Chaukri Yuga. At present, 4 Asankhya Chaukri
Yugas (24%) have expired. That is to say, the earth will
yet face dissolution millions of times more. It is only then
that Niranjan will perish (End Time).

Q.- **62) Can’t Param Purush stop the creation of**
this material world by allowing Niranjan to return to
His abode?
A.) No, Niranjan received boon to rule for a period
of 17 Asankhya Chaukri Yugas. Till then he can’t go to
Amarlok. The word given by Param Purush can’t be
broken.
Niranjan himself makes this attempt. He prays to
Param Purush after every great dissolution to take back
the Souls and allow him to return to Amarlok as he has
grown sick of creating the universe again and again. Sahib
says that He has granted his request to rule for 17
Asankhya Chaukri Yugas and as such, he should continue
to do the job of creation as before.

Q.-63) When the rule of Niranjan would come to
an end, he will perish. would Param purush create
some other Niranjan?
A.) No, never again. When Niranjan, the torturer of
the Jivas, perishes, Param Purush won’t create any more
Niranjan again ( Only Amarlok will remain).


78 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-64) Why did Param Purush create Maya?
A.) At first Param Purush was all alone. When he
created Mind, a bit of that element remained behind. In
normal life as well, we find that even after cleaning a dirty
place, some of the dirt is still left behind. In the same
manner, Param Purush removed from within Him the
traces of dirt that were left behind after the creation of
Mind. It was that dirt which appeared in the form of girl
and it is the same Maya that has given birth to the whole
of world (Biodiversity).

Q.- **65) Didn’t Param Purush know that Niranjan**
would turn out to be such a Character? If He knew,
why did He create him?
A.) All the children of the same parents don’t have
the same nature. Param Purush, in order to increase the
Charm of His Amarlok, created Sons simply by the
uttering of words. However, Niranjan turned out to be a
bad Son and a torturer of the Jivas. When Param Purush
was creating Sons, He, in order to create one like Himself,
uttered a word in some forceful manner. It was not
possible to create one like Himself because He was
eternally existed never created and that which is created
has to Perish. Except the Soul everything else has been
created and as such, will perish with time. When that Son
was created, Param Purush, in order to verify whether he
was like Himself, entered his being.
For a moment, He doubted that that was not His own
self and so coming out of it at that very moment, He
entered into His own. This created all the problem. Had
He known that Niranjan would turn out to be such a of
fellow, He would never have created him.
Q.-66) Why did Param Purush hand over His
Souls to Niranjan? Does it mean He threw us into this
world, knowingly?


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 79
A.) Niranjan Meditated on Param Purush for a pe-
riod of 204 Yugas. Param Purush was pleased with his
hard worship and asked him to ask for what he wanted.
Niranjan prayed to Him to either give him the whole of
Amarlok or give him some separate abode. It was only
then that Param Purush asked him to create 3 Lokas in
Shunya and rule over it. As he had no Jiva to rule over, he
Prayed Param Purush to hand over some souls to him.
Under the sway of devotion, He created Adhya Shakti and
handing over countless Souls to her, asked her to help
Niranjan in giving birth to a real creation. He did not ask
them to imprison the Souls in bodily cages. Nevertheless,
Niranjan, along with Maya, didn’t care for it and instead,
put the Souls in bodily cages thus preventing their escape
to Amarlok.
Had Niranjan not put the Souls in the Mayaic cages,
the Souls would have returned to Sat Lok as and when
they desired and also they would have saved themselves
from any torture. So it is clear that Param Purush had no
hand in all this. Niranjan committed all sorts of bad acts
and proved himself to be a bad and disobedient son.

Q.- **67) Didn’t Param Purush Know that Niranjan**
would torture the Jivas? Why did He give him the
Souls without ensuring their safety?
A.) Param Purush has made the souls so safe that
Niranjan can do no harm to them.

Q.- **68) Isn’t the curse to Niranjan to devour one**
Lakh Jivas daily a sort of punishment to the soul?
A.) No, this is the punishment to the Mind, instead.

Jeev Ke Sung Munn Kal Rahayi, Agyani Ner Janat Nahi.
Kaal in the guise of Mind is residing within
Individual beings, but the ignorant persons don’t realise it.


80 Sahib Bandgi
Q.-69) Was the creation of the body by Niranjan
and Adhya Shakti meant for carrying on the creation
through semen?
A.) No, This was certainly not the case. Adhya
Shakti had no womb in her. Niranjan created it with his
nails against the clear cut directions of Param Purush and
even produced the Tridevas out of her. Then all of them
together created the Mayaic universe.

Q.-70) Niranjan was a bad son but why did
Adhya Shakti help Niranjan in entangling the Jivas in
the Mayaic net?
A.) Adhya Shakti had not committed much fault.
This is because she didn’t want to do all this. She was,
rather, frightened and forced by Niranjan to do so. She
had fallen in his imprisonment and taking advantage of
her helplessness he forced her to co-operate with him in
the creation of the Mayaic world. Like the worldly ladies,
she forgot the abode of Param Purush and co-operated
with Niranjan in creating the Mayaic bodies.

Q.-71) The soul loses its normal functioning when
some evil soul enters into it. It means, anything can be
put in the soul or taken out of it. If it is not so, how
does the evil soul enter?
A.) No, neither it is possible to put even a very small
thing into the Soul nor it is possible to take anything out
of it. The evil Soul can in no way make its entry into the
Soul. For instance, when a person takes wine, the
intoxication effects his brain. As a result, his feet begin to
lose balance. However, it doesn’t happen so with the Soul.
Likewise, the effect of the evil Souls falls on our
individuality. What to talk of evil souls, even death can’t
dare to come near the Soul.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 81
Q.-72) If this human birth is taken as an opportu-
nity to seek Salvation, then why at all did Niranjan
give such an opportunity?
A.) It was the compulsion of Niranjan. Suppose you
are made a king. Then who will you rule over? On the
animals, birds or on human beings. Certainly you would
like to rule over human beings like you. For that, you will
choose some great intellectuals to work for you. Niranjan
did the same. He has made man like himself. That is why
the human body is called as the Naraini Chola. Man has
more awakening in him in comparison to other species.
Further, it is your Sons who complete your left over work.
Likewise, it is man whom Niranjan has chosen for the
completion of his various works. If there is anyone who
has decorated the world, it is man and man alone. He has
constructed dams, palaces, roads and other countless
things. The lions, dogs or the donkeys etc. can’t do such a
job.
That is why he had to create human beings. He made
him out of all the 5 material elements with him and gave
him the needed Knowledge for the purpose. Seating
himself within everyone as Mind, he makes all of us
wander as per his sweet choice. (Regulating Gunas-
Quality of thoughts) Though he is present in all the
creatures, yet he can’t get the works done without them. It
is only the human beings, who can execute these works.

Q.- **73) Why didn’t Niranjan create human beings**
alone? Why did he create other kinds of animals?
A.) Had he created only the human beings, the things
would have gone wrong. Repeated human births would
have increased man’s state of awakening and would have
made him remember his previous births. That is why man
is made to forget all about it by making him pass through
the repeated cycle of 84 Lakhs Yonis, lower life forms.


82 Sahib Bandgi
But for this, man would have thought of attaining
Salvation at the earliest and the whole play of Niranjan
would have got spoiled. Man becomes awakened in the
last period of his life. He has with him many experiences
of life and begins to realize the imortence of Salvation.

Q.-74) Man is seen worshiping so many Gods. Do
so many Gods exist?
A.) No, they have been created by man keeping in
view his self interest and in the time to come, many more
Gods will make their appearance.

Q.-75) What is intellect? Can it help us attain
God?
A.) No, this is a form of Mind. It is the intellect that
takes decisions. In the guise of intellect, this Munn of ours
misleads us. It does so by supplying the energy to the
intellect. The person whose tissues of brain take a turn on
the left side after passing through the neck, will become a
left hander. All his energy will move to that side.
Similerly, when the thought expresses some desire, its
energy enters in its form that is Mind itself and when it
enters the intellect—its other form—it sends its energy to
it. When the Mind expresses desire, it is called as Thought
and when it takes some decision, it is called as intellect. It
means, all the decisions taken with our intellect are a
hurdle in our path. This intellect is a great net of Mind.
It is the Mind that has entangled the Soul in the
world and imprisoned. It becomes clear that intellect is a
weapon of Mind—in no way help us attain God.
Neech Neech Sabb Ter Gaye, Sant Charan Lau Leen.
Jathin Ke Abhiman Mein, Doobe Bahut Kuleen. _—_ Kabir Sahib
Surrendering to Sants, the low class with no ego on
caste, get liberated while those with ego about their higher
status get drowned in the ocean of births and deaths.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 83
Q.-76) Why is there injustice in this world?
A.) This is because this is not the Universe of Satya
Purush. It is futile to hope for justice in this universe of
Niranjan. Sahib Kabir has beautifully said—
Dhanya Niranjan Tera Durbar,
Jahan Tanik Nehin Neyae Vichar.
Oh Niranjan! Strange is thy Durbar. There is nothing
like justice to be seen here.
Karam Kravat Aaphi, Kashat Dait Puni Jeev Ko
He himself makes the Beings engage in all sorts of
karmas and then punishes them.
Sometimes he makes the Individuals perform noble
deeds while at other times he makes them do wrong
Karmas. Just as in any other country, we find different
laws, in the world of Niranjan there are laws formulated
by him as per his own choice. Niranjan himself is the king
of all that is wrong and mischievous. As such, these very
things are found everywhere in his Universe. It is by
cheating and deceptive behavior that Niranjan succeeded
in getting all the Souls from Param Purush. Again, he
succeeded in having Adhya Shakti through deceitful acts.
He turned the relation of Sister into that of a wife. Further,
through deceitful means alone he imprisoned the Souls in
bodily cages thus preventing them to go to Sat Lok.
Therefore in this universe, often we see bad people rising
on the basis of evil deeds whereas the honest persons are
seen laboring hard to earn their livelihood.
The worldly people are seen following the evil
natured Sages while the real Sages and Sants have to face
denunciation. In fact, a true Sant has to labor hard to make
the people understand the real and true form of worship.
So the Individuals are made to attain heaven or hell
as per their Karmas. They are made to pay for the Karmas
performed by them in their previous birth. It is up to
Niranjan to make the beggar a king or the king a beggar.


84 Sahib Bandgi
Therefore, when the very basis of this universe is
falsehood, it is useless to hope for justice here.

Q.-77) Is the woman a Maya?
A.) No, The woman is not Maya. In fact, the body is
Maya whereas the woman represents a class.

Q.-78) Why do the Gods to desire the human
birth?
A.) This is because all other Yonis except that of the
human beings are called as Bhog Yonis. There one has
only to reap the fruit of one’s Karmas. There is no scope
for performing any new Karmas. The Gods reap the good
fruit of their noble deeds. They can’t do any new Karma.
However, it is man alone who, in addition to reaping the
fruit of his Karmas, is at liberty to perform new Karmas as
well. If he desires, he can attain heaven, Brahm Lok,
Niranjan Lok or even the Amarlok. So to say, he can reach
his original abode and attain Permanent Salvation. The
Gods don’t get such an opportunity. That is why they
desire to have the human birth.

Q.-79) The Guru of the woman is her husband. So
where is the need for her to seek the shelter of some
other Guru?
A.) No, it is not so. If it is so, she will also follow the
path of hell if her husband is following the same. If the
husband himself has no Spiritual knowledge, how he can
be expected to give the same to his wife. Remember! He
who attains Spiritual knowledge , doesn’t remain in the
company of woman. He will either remain unmarried or
will take to Sanyas and move out to help others after
becoming Spiritually enlightened. Therefore, it is foolish
to call the husband as the Guru of his wife. Still, many
will not agree to it so easily.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 85
I’ll tell you about a person in this regard. A certain
lady came to me. She said that her husband didn’t allow
her to come to the Ashram. I asked her the reason thereof.
She said that he believed the Guru of a woman was her
husband alone. I asked her to bring her husband to me.
She said that he didn’t agree to it. I asked her to remain
concentrated on the Naam. She said that he didn’t let her
do even that much. I told her that he is not interrupting her
breath and she should recite the Naam in the Breath.
At some occasion, there was a marriage ceremony in
Ranjdi. Both of them happened to come there to attend the
marriage. The lady asked her husband to go to the Ashram
for a while. The fellow refused to oblige her saying that
Sahib knew magic whereby he entangled others. However,
the lady told him that there was no harm in going. It was
not binding on him to get blessed with Naam. Anyhow,
the fellow agreed. The lady came to inform me that her
husband would be coming to me soon. When the lady
signaled me about his arrival, I told him about the
necessity of seeking the shelter of a Guru. I said that even
the Shastras say that one can’t attain salvation without
seeking the shelter of some Guru. The fellow said that a
wife needn’t have a Guru. I asked him to quote the
scripture. He continued to repeat his words without giving
any evidence. I at once knew that I had to deal with a hard
nut. I asked him if he had heard of Shiv Ji. He replied in
affirmative. I asked him if he knew the name of his wife.
Parvati, he replied. I asked him to tell the name of the
Guru of Parvati. He replied in negative. I told him that
Narad Ji was her Guru. If the wife of Shiv Ji had to seek
the shelter of a Guru, what can be said about a common
man. Then I asked him if he had heard of Ram. He replied
in affirmative. I asked him the name of his wife. Sita, he
said. I asked him the name of the Guru of Sita. Again he
replied in negative. I told him that Vashishat Muni was the


86 Sahib Bandgi
Guru of Sita. Ram Ji never said that he was her Guru.
Even then, the fellow continued to be unrelenting.
I told him that he was talking like an dull man who
lived in Delhi. His wife had a cow. She fed her family on
the earnings she got from the sale of milk. One day the
fellow announced that he would give the cow in charity to
one who made him understand the meaning contained in
the 18th chapter of the Gita. The wife protested saying
how will they earn their living. He assured her that none
would be able to make him understand the meaning
contained in that chapter. As such, there was nothing to
worry about. She said that there were many
knowledgeable persons in Kashi. The fellow consoled her
saying, even if someone succeeded in making him
understand in a satisfactory manner, he’ll politely say that
he had not understood it.
I told the fellow that his arguments were the same as
that of that fellow. The Shastras say—
'Dhayan Moolam Guru Roopam'
Meditate on the form of Guru.
Remember! None can attain God even after
worshiping many lives. The Ramayana says—
Guru Bin Bhavjal Nidhi Tarei Na Koyi,
Hari Virinchi Shanker Sum Hoyi
Even if one becomes great like Hari or Shiv Ji, one
can’t succeed in crossing the worldly ocean.
Shiv Ji took Brahspati as his Guru whereas Brahma
Ji took Agni ( fire ) as his Guru.
Ram Krishan Se Kau Bada, Tin Bhi To Guru Keen
Teen Lok Ke Naika, Guru Ke Aage Adheen
Even the Great Souls like Ram and Krishan sought
the shelter of a Guru. That is to say, the Lords of the 3
Worlds had to bow before the Guru.
After studying the Sahastras one feels the necessity
of seeking the shelter of a Guru but the hypocrite puts
hurdles on the path.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 87
Q.- **80) Can’t Param Purush** liberate the souls if
He desires so.?
A.) He can do so within a moment but, as explained
earlier, His word (to Niranjan) will break if He does so.

Q.-81)What wrong had the Soul done?
A.) It failed to seek the shelter of real Satguru who
could help it reach Amarlok.
Avail of this opportunity and recognize your
Satguru.

Q.-82) Does our prayer to get something or to
find relief from some problem reach God or we con-
tinue to do so in darkness?
A.) All the prayers made by the worldly people
reach Niranjan alone. All the problems related to the body
have nothing to do with Param Purush. They are related to
Niranjan alone. That Niranjan gives all the things to the
people so that they may take him as the real God who
hears their prayers, by default. He will give only the
material things and in no case he would give the
knowledge of the Soul.
Let me tell you some facts about Nichiketa. His
father was a king. He wanted to give an old cow in
charity. He didn’t like the idea. He thought that one
should give only some fine things in charity. He asked his
father whom he would give him in charity. The father
didn’t pay any heed to what he said. Nichiketa repeated
her question but the king paid no heed to it. However,
when he continued to repeat his question, his father said
that he will give him in charity to death. He went to Chitar
Gupat. Yamraj told him that he was a just king and had
mistakenly come there. He told him that he was much
pleased with him and asked what he wanted. The king said
that he wanted Spiritual knowledge. Yam Raj asked him


88 Sahib Bandgi
not to ask for that. He said that he was prepared to give
him anything else he wanted.
I mean to say, knowingly or unknowingly, we don’t
succeed in making our prayer heard by the real God.
Instead, it reaches Niranjan, the ruler of the 3 Worlds who
doesn’t bother about our welfare. He doesn’t want to
reveal the real Spiritual knowledge.

Q.-83) Is it a fact that that there are 6 bodies
within our body? If so, which are those 6 bodies?
A.) Yes, every man has 6 bodies with him. They
are—Sathool, Suksham, Karan, Mahakaran, Geyan and
Vigyan. Man doesn’t have a complete knowledge of
himself. Let’s talk about them one by one.

1. Sathool Sharir—It is our own physical body. All
   can see it. It is a perishable body. The Gods don’t have it.
   We reside in this very body. That is why all of us have a
   knowledge of it. However, the power of this body is
   limited. With our material eyes we can see up to some
   definite distance only. Likewise, with the material ears we
   can hear the sound coming from some reasonable distance
   and range. We can use our mouth to send our sound to
   some limited distance alone. The same is true in case of
   other organs as well.
2. Suksham Sharir — We attain this body when we
   are in sleep. The Jiva finds itself in quite a different kind
   of world called as the Dreamland. There is a very subtle
   cells on the left side of our throat. We reach when our
   concentration fixed there. We take the very world we find
   there, as the real one. Just as in our awakened state, we
   take this unreal world that we see with our gross body, as
   the real one, in the same manner, we take the strange
   world we see with the subtle body we attain in our
   dreams, as the real one. Man has a very close relation with
   this subtle body and the world of dreams. This is because
   one can see many events related to many past births.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 89
In the dream world it is we who are the actors. This
sounds very strange. Man is not aware of this. We move
from this gross body into that subtle body. After all, what
was that which escaped from the gross body and entered
into this subtle one?
That subtle body does all sorts of works and watches
all the activities. Then again we return to our gross body.
However, we fail to understand as to how we moved out
and how we returned. What was that which moved out?
The first body became lifeless whereas the second one
became alive. If we happen to meet our brother, we at
once recognize him. So to say, everything appears to be
real. This is the miracle of this second body. What a
strange thing! Though we read at many places that this
material world is dream like, still we don’t change our
thoughts.
You never think over as to why did you enter into
the dream state. A certain scientist has been making a
search about the dreams for the past 40 years.
Nevertheless, I say I’ll explain to him within a moment all
about dreams.
In the dream, state, if we happen to face sorrows and
sufferings, these will give us the same amount of pain as
we would feel in our awakened state. On the other hand, if
we find pleasures, these would appear to us as much real
as we would have felt in our awakened state. No doubt,
this human body is of a very rare kind.
Appearing of every thing as true and real is nothing
but a play of our Indrias- Senses.
When the same Soul is present in all, what is
responsible for the difference in the amount of
knowledge? This is because of the difference in the
structure of different bodies. Some vehicles can move at
the speed of 150 Km an hour. However skilled the driver
be, he can’t make such a vehicle run at a greater speed. It


90 Sahib Bandgi
is the case with the body too. The soul regulates it as per
its structure.

3. Karan Sharir—This is a very rare body. It is
   related to meditation. It is very powerful. Try to
   understand its power. Suppose you are attending the
   Satsang and are looking at me and listening to my
   discourse, but if for a moment divert your concentration to
   some other thing, you are unable to listen to my words and
   understand me and even while watching and very much
   sitting near me. That is to say, the power to see, hear and
   understand is due to concentration only. If you are able to
   have a knowledge of this body, you can send it anywhere
   you like to collect some information about that place.
   With the power of this very body, sometimes man
   recollects his old days while at other times he begins to
   have a glimpse of his future life. Some say they happened
   to see some evil spirit. It came near due to the power of
   the Karan Sharir only. Sometimes your attention gets
   turned to someone even when you haven’t even thought of
   him. Soon that fellow appears before you. That is to say,
   the fellow was near you through Karan Sharir. None else
   was able to sight him. This is, indeed, the miracle of this
   Karan sharir.
   Again, sometimes you find someone engrossed in
   some deep thoughts. You reach near him and ask in which
   thoughts he has been lost. Sometimes this happens with
   you as well. So to say, man can find many miracles if he
   makes a search for the same. Even you yourself fall in
   such a position. It is a reality but the system of our
   physical body doesn’t seem to recognize it.
   A certain Nami- Initiate told me that a Serial related
   to the past life was being telecast on the TV. He asked if
   such a thing actually happened. I told him that everyone
   has a knowledge of his past 100 lives but the capacity of
   the body is limited. How can we remember the
   happenings of 100 lives when we can’t recollect even that


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 91
which we have heard a few moments before? If someone
makes an attempt to repeat that which he heard some
minutes before, he will surely forget many things. Then
how can we ever hope to recollect the happenings of one's
100 lives?
The Hindu religion says—

1. God exists.
2. The soul is immortal.
3. The soul has to enter into different bodies as per
   its Karmas.
   Janam Ek Nehin Janam Aneka, Chhote Nehin Karam Ko Lekha
   The Karmas of many lives are with us. We can’t get
   rid of them.
   It is only the Soul that remembers the happenings of
   many lives. Sometimes you say you would see on
   reaching Amarlok as to what kind of appearance do the
   Soul, Amarlok, and Param Purush have. However, it is a
   fact that you have a knowledge of Param Purush, Amarlok
   as well as the Soul. Believe that, you know all this due to
   your being a Soul. Nevertheless, your present conscience
   doesn’t seem to accept it.
   Our brain turns it as supposition. A horse will
   collapse if we put 6 quintals of load on it. Likewise, the
   brain doesn’t want to store the extra knowledge in it. If it
   tries to do so, one will turn mad. That is why it remains
   engrossed in the current problems only and terms the
   information being provided by the Soul as unreal.
   If a child, right from the childhood, desires to be a
   wrestler, take it for granted he was a wrestler in his
   previous birth as well. The same is true in case of other
   desires like becoming a Sage, a Teacher, a Doctor and
   alike. In such cases the Mind and the consciousness make
   the same kind of movement.
   Vasdev Krishan too tells Arjun that he has no
   knowledge of his previous births whereas he (Krishan) has
   a knowledge of the past 100 lives.


92 Sahib Bandgi
There is no other system in the world that can enable
us meet anyone we like. However, this Karan Sharir can
help us meet our ancestors as well.
All the religions lay stress on meditation. But it is
our Mind that causes a hurdle on our path of entering into
other bodies. It remains engaged in finding as to what is
right or wrong for the body. It has no power to think
beyond it.
We can’t do anything without the proper system.
Just as we can’t use our nose to see objects and can’t use
our ears to enjoy fragrance and so on, in the same manner,
we can’t experience the rare Worlds with the help of this
physical body. Suppose we want to fly, we won’t be able
to do so for lack of the needed system in us.
We watch the outward glimpse of worship where the
Mahatmas are seen dancing, jumping, weeping and doing
all such superfluous activities.
Sahib Kabir has said—
Surti Se Dekh Sakhi Vo Desh
One can have the vision of Amarlok through
concentration alone.

4. Mahakaran Sharir—This is a very rare kind of
   body. Man practices Yog for attaining it. The Yogis on
   attaining this body move about in the Brahmands. This
   body is a storehouse of miraculous powers
   This body is smaller than even the grain of masoor
   (a kind of pulse). To attain it, one has to fix concentration
   at the Trikuti. Disappearing from one place and appearing
   at some other, is all due to it. It helps in reaching Brahm
   Lok as well. This is called as the opening of interior eyes
   as well. Remember! You are not an ordinary person. You
   are a part of Param Purush.
5. Geyan Dehi— Getting this Sharir, the Yogi
   begins to consider himself as Brahm. This is because he
   attains the power to give birth to a new creation on his
   own. Whatever he Speaks, begins to happen. Often we


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 93
hear about such and such God. This miracle is due to the
attaining of this very sharir.

6. Vigyan Dehi— On attaining this Sharir, the Mind
   reaches in a state of unconsciousness. So to say, it reaches
   in a state of Coma whereas the Soul becomes very much
   awakened.
   Goswami Ji has described this state in a beautiful
   manner —
   Pug Bina Chaley Sune Bin Kana,
   Binu Karam Karey Vidhi Nana
   The devotee can move without feet, can hear without
   ears and can do a lot of works even without any effort
   He also says that the devotee, even without
   speaking, can become a great orator and can see without
   eyes. That is to say, it is not possible to describe the glory
   of this Sharir.
   It enables the Jiva watch a variety of mysterious
   plays. All this happens after passing through the 10th
   Dwara. The Ida and Pingla attain a unison when this
   happens. Apart from man, none else is in possession of
   this body.
   Sabb Ki Gathri Lal Hai, Koi Nahi Kangal.
   Every human being has great hidden miraculous
   powers within them.

Q.-85) Param Purush had 16 sons. But why did
He give the Souls to the bad Son alone?
A.) The Jivas continued to move about in a joyful
manner in Amarlok. After a long time the 5th son,
Niranjan, began to meditate. He meditated on Param
Purush for a period of 70 Yugas. The latter was pleased
with his worship and asked the reason behind worshiping
so hard. Niranjan said that he wanted to have some abode
of his own. Param Purush gave him Mansrovar (a
continent of Amarlok ). Niranjan was pleased to have it.
He began to live there in a joyful manner. However, once


94 Sahib Bandgi
again, he began to worship Param Purush. He did so again
for a period of 70 Yugas.
Param Purush was pleased and asked what he
wanted.
Itna Thanv Na Mohi Suhai
Abb Mohi Baksi Deh-Hu Thakurai
Kai Mohi Dehu Lok Adhikara
Kai Mohi Dehu Desh Ik Neyara
Niranjan said that he was not pleased with that
much. Either He should give him Amarlok or a rare kind
of Loka where he could have his full sway.
At this, Param Purush told him that his elder brother
Kooram had with him a seed of 5 material elements in a
subtle form. He should go to him and beg from him that
very seed.
With that he should create 3 Lokas in Shunya
(space). Also, he could rule there for a period of 17
Asankhya Chaukri Yugas.
Niranja went to Kooram but instead of requesting
him to give him the seed of 5 material elements and three
gunas, he took it forcibly from him in a manner one
squeezes out blood from someone’s body. Kooram Ji
remained calm and peaceful. But he asked Param Purush
as to what kind of a devil He had sent to him. He had
robbed him of the seed of 5 material elements in a forceful
manner. Param Purush asked him to remain calm saying
he (Niranjan)was his younger brother.
Param Purush thought as to what a kind of Niranjan
had been created.
With the seed of 5 material elements Niranjan
created the 5 material elements (water, fire, air, earth and
sky). Also, he created 49 crore Yojan Earth, Sun, Moon,
Stars, Seven Patals etc. He remained in Shunya for some
time. Nevertheless, it was a lifeless universe as there were
no Beings. Niranjan thought that the universe without


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 95
beings was not worth living. As such, he again
worshipped for a period of 64 Yugas.
Param Purush asked as to what more he wanted.
Niranjan said—
Dee Jae Khet Beej Nij Sara
Niranjan prayed that he had created the 3 Lokas but
there were no Jivas to rule over. He prayed to Him to
kindly give some hansas to him.
Then Param Purush desired and created a girl
(Adhya Shakti) with 8 arms. She offered salutations to
Him and asked as to why she had been created. Giving her
infinite number of souls, Param Purush said—
O daughter! Niranjan is in Mansrovar. He has
created the 3 Lokas in Shunya. Go to him and help him in
giving birth to a true and real universe. That is to say, the
universe had to be created like the one in Amarlok. It was
a clear message that the souls hadn’t to be imprisoned in
the bodily cages.

Q.-86) Inspite of being a son of Param Purush,
why did Niranjan ask for the Jivas? Even if he did so,
why did he torture them?
A.) We often hear in the Kathas-Stories that not only
the Gods but the Demons as well worshipped hard.
However, the only difference was that whereas the Gods
asked for the blessings of Lord or sought such powers as
could be used for the good of others, the demons asked for
such powers as could make them invincible. Moreover,
they asked for long lives as well. They used the powers
attained through blessings only for torturing others.
Niranjan as well did the same. As he was created by
the forceful utterance of sound, he turned like a demon.
He worshiped Param Purush and asked for such things as
had nothing to do with the good of others. He tortured the
Jivas and behaved in a very cruel manner with his brother
Kooram as well. His behavior with Adhya Shakti clearly


96 Sahib Bandgi
shows that he was a demon and not a noble and virtuous
Son of Param Purush.
Nevertheless, though Niranjan imprisoned the souls
in bodily cages and gave them all sorts of tortures, yet he
couldn’t do so in the real sense as Param Purush had made
Souls completely safe and secure from harms. The tortures
were, in fact, suffered by Niranjan himself.

Q.-87) Who created Amarlok, 14 Lokas,
Niranjan, Maya, Souls, Brahmand, the gods and the
goddesses etc.? And how were these created?
A.) Once Dharam Dass Ji, in order to know about
Amarlok and the creation of the universe, prayed to Sahib
Kabir thus—
Abb Sahib Mohe Deu Batai, Amarlok Ki Kahan Rahai
Kaun Deep Hans Ko Vasa, Kaun Deep Purush Rah Vasa
Teen Lok Utpati Bakho, Baranhuskal Goye Jani Rakho
Kaal Niranjan Kis Vidhi Bhaeu, Kaise Shodas Sut Nirmeyu
Kaise Char Khani Vistari, Kaise Jeev Kaal Vash Dari
Trideva Kaun Vidhi Bhayeu, Kaise Mahi Akash Nirmayeu
Chander Surya Kahu Kaise Bhayeu,Kaise Taragan Sub Thayeu
Kis Vidhi Bhei Sharir Ki Rachna Bhasho Sahib Utpati Bachna
O Sahib! Kindly tell me where does that Amarlok
lie? At which place are the Jivas to be found there and
how were the 3 Lokas, Kaal Purush and 16 sons created?
How did this flawless Soul enter into the 4 Khanis? How
did the Souls get entrapped in the net of Kaal Purush?
How were the Tridevas, the earth, sky and the physical
bodies created? Kindly tell me in detail all about this.
Sahib Kabir said—
Tabb Ki Baat Sunhu Dharam Dassa,
Jab Nehin Mahi Patal Akasha
Jabb Nehin Kooram Brah Aur Shesh,
Jab Nehin Sharad Gauri Ganesha
Jabb Nehin Hatey Niranjan Raya,
Jin Jeevan Kah Bandhi Jhulaya
Taitees Koti Devta Nahin,


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 97
Aur Anek Bataun Kahin
Brahma Vishnu Mahesh Ne Tahiya,
Shaster Ved Puran Na Kehya
Tabb Sub Rahe Purush Ke Mahin,
Jyuin Batt Briksh Madhya Rah Shayin
O Dharam Dass! I am talking about the time when
there was neither earth nor sky. There was no existence of
Kooram, Barah, Sharad, Gauri, Ganesh, 33 crore gods and
even Niranjan, the torturer of the Jivas. What more can I
say, there was no existence of Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh,
The Vedas, The Shastras and the Puranas even. But there
was the One.
Sahib Kabir says that at first Param Purush was all
alone. He had no companion. Neither He has ever been
created nor He will ever perish.
That which is created, has to perish. But how can
Param Purush who has never been created, perish? Sahib
kabir tells Dharam Dass that Sakar, Nirakar, abodes—big
and small—were created afterwards. As such, whose
witness can he give? Even the 4 Vedas throw no light on
the secrets related to Param Purush. They talk up to the
limit of Niranjan alone.
Describing the creation of the earth, sky, Brahmand,
Niranjan, Tridevas and the like, Sahib Kabir says that first
of all Param Purush desired and uttered a word. It created
a rare kind of brilliant white light that spread to infinity.
That light was not like the one to be found in this
universe. Every particle of it could put crores of Suns to
insignificance.
When that light spread in the infinite, Param Purush
Himself got absorbed into it. That light then became alive.
It was just like the case of a body that becomes alive after
the entry of Soul into it.
Before entering into the light, Param Purush was
unmanifest from sight but after entering into it, He was
called as Satya Purush.


98 Sahib Bandgi
The light that was Satya Purush Himself, came to be
called as Amarlok. Imitating this, Niranjan, first of all
created the 3 Lokas with the help of 5 material elements
and then hid himself from sight and got absorbed into the
3 Lokas. Just as Amarlok is the body of Satya Purush, the
3 Lokas are the body of Niranjan.
Satya Purush was still all alone. He desired and
jerked away that light—His own self—from Him. Infinite
number of droplets were formed out of it. These returned
back to that light. It was just like the formation of droplets
when one takes a handful of water, say from the sea, and
throws it upward. However, the difference between the
two was that while the droplets of water again fall into the
sea and become a part of it, the droplets of light though
did return to the light but they didn’t become a part of it.
This is because Satya Purush desired that these should
retain their separate identity. These very droplets were
called as Hansas (Souls). Those Hansas began to move
about in that light deriving indescribable bliss.
Such a movement of the Hansas was miraculous,
indeed. This is because the droplets of the sea have no
separate identity. The jivas began to move about in that
light in a manner a fish moves in water. Param Purush
derived much pleasure from this and began to love those
Hansas. They continued to enjoy like this for a long time.
Sada Anand Hoat Hai Va Ghar, Kabhu Na Hoat Udasa.
There are bliss and bliss alone to be seen in that
Amarlok. No sorrows and sufferings are to be found there.
There the light of a soul is equivalent to that of 16
Suns whereas the light of even a single pore of Param
Purush is equivalent to that of crores of Suns and Moons.
If it is so, just imagine what kind of Param Purush
Himself would be. It is really beyond imagination and
description.
Then Param Purush created Sons simply by the
uttering of words. That is to say, every word spoken by


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 99
Him was turning into a Son. The second word created
Kooram. Likewise, the third word created Geyan and the
4th one created Vivek.
Param Purush saw that every word spoken by Him
was changing into a Son, so He thought of making one
like Himself. As such, He uttered a word in a forceful
manner. Niranjan (Mind) was crerated out of it. In order to
know whether the 5th Son was like Him or not, He
merged Himself into him. For split of a moment He
doubted that this body was not His own one. As such, He
pulled Himself out of it and again entered into His own.
Then He uttered the 6th word. Sahaj was created out
of it. Then the 7th word created Santosh, the 8th one
created Chetna, the 9th one created Anand, the 10th one
created Khyama, the 11th one created Nishkam, the 12th
one created Jalrangi, the 13th one created Achint, the 14th
one created Prem, the 15th one created Deen Dyal
whereas the 16th one created Dhairya. Param Purush
created these sons simply to add glory to His Amarlok. All
of them began to move about in that Amarlok. But the
Soul was not created out of word. Sahib Kabir says;
Jeebra Ansh Purush Ka Aahi, Aadi Ant Kau Janat Nahin
Sahib says that jiva is the very part of Param Purush.
None has any information about its beginning and ending.
Eeshwar Ansh Jeev Avinaashi, Chetan, Amal, Sehaj, Sukhrasi.
This Soul is a part of the Supreme Lord. It is
Immortal (Avinaashi), spiritually active (Chetan), pure
and free of vices (Amal). It is free from deceit and is
spiritually simple (Sehaj). Besides, it is full of joy,
happiness and bliss (Sukhrasi).
Q.-88)What is the secret related to the Chakras?
A.) There are 8 Chakras to be found in our body.
However, the Yogis have a knowledge of the 7 Chakras
alone. On the other hand, the Sants start their Journey
from the 8th Chakra.


100 Sahib Bandgi
Some take it as one and the same thing. There seems
to be no logic in it.
Mooladhar Chakra is the abode of Ganesh Ji, the
navel region is the abode of Vishnu Ji whereas Anhad
Chakra is the abode of Shiv Ji. He is the God of ego. In
this very Chakra (Plexis) a devotee experiences the feeling
of ‘I am’. Vishudh Chakra is the abode of Sarasvati.
All the tunes emanate from here. Agya Chakra is the
abode of Soul. The act of breathing takes place here.
Sahastarsar is the 7th Chakra whereas the 8th Chakra is
the abode of Satguru. But the Yogis remain confined to
the 7th Chakra alone.
Aath Ataki Atari Manjhara, Dekha Purush Neyara
Nirakar Aakar Na Jyoti, Nehin Vah Ved Vichara
Ve Sahib Sub Sant Pukara, Aur Pakhand Hai Sara
In the abode of Param Purush there is nothing like
Nirakar or Aakar. It is beyond the reach of the Vedas. The
Sants have called Sahib as the only reality whereas
everything else are described as unreal and falsehood.
The Sants have talked of the 8th Chakra as well as of
the 9th that is a hidden. When the Yogis have knowledge
of the seven Chakras alone, how can we take it as one and
the same thing? Reaching the 7th Chakra, the devotee
attains the Vigyan dehi. They don’t say anything about the
8th Chakra.
Khaskhas Ke Daney Ke Under, Shehar Khuda Ka Basta Hai.
Per Bin Mehar Murshid Ke Tu, Nahak Mein Hi Pachta Hai.
The whole of the city of Param Purush lies within a
small grain of Khaskhas (a plant) but it is only the real
Satguru who can take you there.
Q.- **89) What are the 5 Mudras? Can’t we attain**
Param Purush with the help of these?
A.) The 5 Mudras are related to the Yog Matt
(Worship of Formless) and in this Matt the devotee has to
earn his own merits. However, on the basis of earnings,


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 101
none can attain Param Purush even if he worships for
crores of years.
A devotee can’t go beyond the limit oif Niranjan on
the basis of these postures. These Mudras are based on the
5 words. It is God who had uttered these words. These
are:- Sohang, Satt, Jyoti Niranjan, R- ranker and Aunkar.
It is Sahib who gave these words. That is to say, it is God
who uttered these words (to manifest elements) but none
of these words is God Himself. Therefore, those who call
the Word as God, worship Niranjan and not the real Sahib.
Using these 5 Mudras, our ancestors labored hard
and left behind their achievements and experiences. Sahib
Kabir has not refuted these. He has simply said that this is
Yog and not Spiritualism. These 5 Mudras are—
Chachri Mudra:-
Jyoti Niranjan Chachri Mudra, So Hai Nainan Mahin
Tehi Ko Jana Gorakh Yogi,Maha Tej Hai Tahi
This Mudra has its place in eyes center. Here the
word ‘Jyoti Niranjan’ is recited ( fire element). Gorakh
yogi practiced it. It gave him a great pleasure.
Those who practiced it were Brahmcharis. Now even
the family holders are seen talking about it. They can’t
succeed in it as it needs much energy.
Jahan Bhog Tahan Yog Vinasha
Where there is bhog, there is no place for Yog.
Practice of this Mudra can’t help in attaining Soul
realization. Human body is full of numerous miraculous
powers. Everything is to be found in it. That is why it has
been called as the Naraini Chola. A devotee can see many
miraculous things when he succeeds in awakening the
related cell centers.
We are living in the Scientific age. The Doctors have
succeeded in having the knowledge of almost every pore
of the body. Nevertheless, the scientists are unable to
know all these knowledge related to the cell centers. In
this Chachri Mudra, the devotee experiences many


102 Sahib Bandgi
miraculous things. Fixing of concentration opens the
centers in a manner a key opens the lock. When all the
cells get awakened, the devotee attains many kinds of
miraculous powers. It enables him to see many Universes
as Alakh Brahm (Kal Niranjan pervading space). That is
why the Yogis talk about the Alakh Brahm.
Seeing the great light there, it has been taken as God
Himself.
Bhuchri Mudra :-
Shabad Aunkar Bhoochri Mudra, Trikuti Hai Asthana
Veas Dev Tako Pahichana, Chand Surya So Jana.
In this Mudra the word ‘Aunkar’ is recited. Its place
is at Trikuti. Vyas Dev practiced it and was able to see the
expanse of Sun, moon and Planets.
A devotee can have visions after fixing his
concentration at this point (Water element). So to say,
concentration is the Master key to attain anything.
Dheyan Hi Ved Shaster Kahat Hain, Dheyan Hi Ved Bakhana.
The Vedas and the Shastras have described the
miracle of concentration (Ekagratha). Many devotees in
our country are engaged in fixing concentration at this
point. They have succeeded in opening the center but they
have failed to attain real Spiritual knowledge.
During his dialogue with Gorakh Yogi, Sahib had
asked him where he would fix his concentration when Ida,
Pingla and even Sushumna will perish.
Agochari Mudra:-
Sohang Shabad Agochari Mudra, Bhanwar Gufa Asthana.
Shuk Dev Tako Pahichana, Sun Anhad Ki Tana.
In this Mudra the word ‘Sohang’ is recited. Here the
concentration is fixed in Bhanwar Gufa. Shuk Dev
practiced this Mudra and listened to the musical notes
emanating from there (Air element). This Mudra is of a
superior than the Bhuchri Mudra. There is awareness as
well as pleasure to be found there. Some get absorbed in
the musical notes emanating from there. However, these


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 103
can’t help us realize the ultimate reality because all these
will perish.
Jap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mer Jaye
Surti Samani Shabad Mein, Us Ko Kaal Na Khaye
Recitation by mouth and the inward recitation are
bound to perish. It is only the Surti ( present in the Naam
itself ) that doesn’t perish. That is to say, it is neither the
Dhunatmic (Sound) word nor the Varnatmic (Alphabat)
word.
So To Shabad Videh
Sahib Kabir says that it is the Soundless Sound.
Do Bin Hoye Na Adhar Awaza
The Sound can be produced only when two things
impact. Where two things act, there is Maya. At present
many devotees practice this Mudra.
Unmuni Mudra:-
Satt Shabad So Unmuni Mudra, Soi Akash Sanehi
Tamein Jhilmil Joat Dikhave, Jana Janak Vidhehi
In Unmuni Mudra, it is the word ‘Satt’ that is recited
(Earth Element). Here one can see a great light. The king
Janak practiced this Mudra.
Khechri Mudra;-
R-Rankar Khechri Mudra Dasvan Dwar Thikana
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh Deva, R-Rankar Ko Jana
In this Mudra the devotee has to fix his concentra-
tion at the 10th Dwara. Here the word ‘R-rankar’ is recited
(Space-ether element). Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh
practiced this Mudra.
Shiv, Gorakh So Pach- Pach Harey, Is Kaya Ka Bheid Na Paye
This body is really full of miracles. Even Shiv and
Gorakh couldn’t succeed in fully unfolding the secrets
related to it.
Though opening of the 10th Dwara can enable a
devotee to move anywhere he likes but he can’t succeed in
attaining his real target, Salvation (Param Moksh).
Sahib Kabir says —


104 Sahib Bandgi
Sidh Sadh Tridev Adi Le, Paanch Shabad Mein Atke
Mudra Sadh Rahey Ghatt Bheeter, Phir Aundhe Munh Latke
Even the great sages and Tridevas remained en-
tangled in the net of these 5 words. However, they had,
once again, to take birth hanging upside down from the
womb of mother.

Q.-90) Does the Soul on reaching Amarlok,
remember this universe?
A.) No, it doesn’t remember anything at all. It for-
gets every thing related to this earth soon after reaching
there (No Mind). So to say, the one gets absorbed in
Immense pleasures there.

Q.-91) After returning to this world from Sat
Lok, does Jiva remember anything about that World.
A.) Yes, It does remembers it. Had it not been true,
how can I give a description of the rare light, that is all
together different from the light to be found in this
universe. Nevertheless, you have forgotten all about it.
This is on account of your long association with the
Mayaic worlds.
I say, you know about all your births but you have
no power to recollect them. Wandering in various Yonis -
repeated births has made you forget all about this.

Satguru Murti Ko Dhyana, Take Sanmukh Vinti Thana.
Means keep concentration ever on Satguru

Q.-92) How does the Soul feel on reaching back to
Sat Lok?
A.) On reaching there, it recollects that it was its
own abode. It finds all as familiar ones. On having the
vision of Param Purush, it doesn’t think it has seen Him
for the first time. So to say, it feels that Amarlok is its real


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 105
abode. The time it spent in the universe of Kaal was
unreal like the dream.

Q.-93) After the departure, the Mind and
memory are dorment, than how is it possible to
remember for some time that there was a world and
how it can one remember existence of that world after
returning from Amarlok?
A.) It is the Mool Surti (Basic awareness in
concentration) that makes us remember all this. This is
really a very wonderful and surprising thing. When there
is nothing like Mind, intellect, remembrance etc. to be
found in Amarlok, how can the things related to that Loka
be remembered. This really sounds strange. The fact is
that the Mool Surti remains with us in any state we reach.
After leaving the mortal body, when one reaches the
heaven, one recognizes one’s identity. Even after reaching
Pitar Lok one has a knowledge of ones relations as well as
of the place of one’s residence. Sometimes you happen to
meet your Grand father or Grand mother in dreams. You
recognize them. There is some reality in it. Likewise, after
reaching Sat Lok, the Soul retains the memory for some
time, of the world it lived in and after returning it
remembers the Sat Lok. So to say, the memory doesn’t get
lost.
In the Gita, Vasdev Krishan tells Arjun that even
though the Soul has no visible eyes, yet it is able to see in
all the directions. Likewise, it can walk without legs and
can speak without the mouth. Therefore, it is but natural
that remembrance is possible without the brain.
Q.-94) Even Sahib Kabir has talked about Ram at
many places. If he has talked about the mode of
worship that is altogether different from that of Sagun
and Nirgun, then which is the Ram he has talked
about?


106 Sahib Bandgi
A.) Sahib Kabir has talked about 4 Rams. The Sants
have used the language of the worldly people to enable
them understand their views in a better way. The Ram
they have talked about is Sahib Param Purush Himself.
They have clarified it in a beautiful way.
Sakar Ram Dashrath Ka Beta, Nirakar Ram Ghat Ghat Leta.
Bindu Ram Jin Jagat Pasara, Niralambh Ram Subhi Te
Neyara.
Sakar Ram is the son of king Dashrath, Nirakar
Ram is present in every body. The Bindu Ram (Sperm) is
responsible for the manifestation of the beings whereas
the Niralamb Ram is the rarest of all.
Ram, the worldly people have been worshiping, falls
in the category of Sakar Ram. At many places the Sants
have been taken as the worshiper of Nirakar Ram. This is
not correct. This Nirakar Ram is none else but Niranjan
himself who is present within all in the guise of Mind, but
that Ram too will perish. The third Ram is the semen that
is responsible for the entire creation. However, the 4th
Ram never perishes. It is this Ram the Sants have called as
Sahib- Param Purush- Sat Purush.
Often we find some words related to the Sagun as
well as the Nirgun worship in the sayings of the Sants.
This is because they had worshiped and spoken on
Niranjan before getting blessed with Naam from Sahib
Kabir.
Further, at many places the Sants have talked about
the secrets related to Yog as well. They have also talked
about the musical notes emanating from within and the
10th Dwara. The people begin to think as if the Sants have
described the significance of Yog. However, this is not the
case. They have only tried to make us understand the
limitation of Yog. Along with that they have described
the importance of Sar Shabad (Sar or Satya Naam). This
Naam is called as the Soundless Sound. They are giving a
description of the musical notes which are heard within


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 107
the human body, it was meant to describe their limit. Only
understand this much that the Sants have described this
universe as the abode of Kal Purush and the Amarlok as
the abode of Param Purush from where the souls have
come. So there is no need to wander outside. The key to
Amarlok is the Sar Shabad that is in the possession of the
Sants alone.
Sar Naam Satya Purush Kahaya
The Sar Naam itself has been called as Satya Purush.
So remember! It is the rare Ram, that the Sants have
talked about.

Q.- **95) If there is some Param Purush, Why don’t**
we find a mention of it in Religious Scriptures?
A.) All the Dharm Shastras were produced from the
sayings of Niranjan (Etherial Voice-Sound-Breath)
whereas the sayings of Sahib Kabir owe their origin to
Sant Kabir Sahib himself. The Vedas or Scriptures
contain all that Niranjan said. It was necessary for him to
hide the secret related to Param Purush otherwise he
couldn’t keep the Individual beings in his net of Maya.
That is why he spoke of his own glory only and didn’t
make any mention of Param Purush in those Religious
Scriptures.
Ved Charon Nehin Janat, Satya Purush Kahaniyan
The Vedas don’t throw any light on the stories re-
lated to Satya Purush.
Ved Hamara Bheid Hain, Hum Vedan Ke Mahin.
Jaun Bheid Mein Main Bason, Vedbhi Janat Nahin.
Sant Kabir Sahib says that the Vedas have in them
the secrets of all of us. Nevertheless, even they can’t tell
about the secret of my abode.
Iske Aage Bhed Hamara, Janey Ga Koyi Jananhara.
Kahein Kabir Janey Ga Soyi, Ja Per Daya Satguru Ki Hoyi.


108 Sahib Bandgi
Sant Kabir Sahib says that his mystery is far beyond
the limits of Niranjan. Only such a devotee as has the
blessings of a Satguru with him, can know that.

Q.-96) What is the difference between Satsang
and Katha?
A.) ‘Katha’ means reciting that which happened in remote
past. The Soul has nothing to do with it. These discourses
appeals to the intellect (Mind is pleased with it not the
Soul). On the other hand, Satsang (Association with
Knower of Truth-Satguru) is that where every word
spoken is related to the Soul. A Story telling can be done
by anyone. It is memorised and then told to others.
However, Satsang provides you the Devotion. That is why
the Sants have talked about Satsang alone.
Satsang provides you with three blessings they are:
Satsang resolves the doubts, helps to concentrate on
Satguru, and charges you with Spiritual powers Being in
the company of such Satguru and developing devotion is
known as Satsang. A moment with such a Sant in devotion
is called Satsang, it is said-
Sat Swag Au Apvarg, Dharaun Tula Ik Ang.
Tahi Sakal Mil Nahin Tule, Je Kshan Lau Satsang.
Therefore
Shakti Bina Nahin Panth Chalaya.
The panth shouldn’t have a birth without the needed
power.
When we go to Satguru for Satsang, Spiritual energy
is obtained by three methods:-
By Auspicious Sight: Dharsan; firstly, when the Guru
looks at us then it sends energy in to us. That’s why when
we go to Guru we pray them to keep auspicious sight on
us. Gadhari had made the Duryodhan's body frigid with
her power of sight only. Means sight can transmit the
Spiritual powers.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 109
By Touch of Guru's Holy feet: Sparshan ; this energy
could possessed by the touch. This can be done by
touching anywhere but touching feet has somehow
become a rule.
By Sound: Sambhasan; then the other method to reach
these rays towards us is sound vibrations. Hence, the
Satsang has a lot of importance.
Dhanya Ghadi Jab Ho Satsanga.

Q.-97) What is heaven?
A.) It is the place within the 3 Lokas of Niranjan
where man goes for a brief period to reap the fruit of his
Karmas (deeds). There are three kinds of classes in
heaven— high, medium and low. There are pleasures and
joys in the lower class but in the medium one the amount
of pleasures and joys is greater than that in the lower one.
However, the upper class is the best of all. However,
There is nothing like soul realization to be found in any
class there. There one gets a body that, unlike the physical
body, is of a subtle form. Man likes to go to heaven but he
doesn’t think as to why the Gods desire to attain the
human body. It clearly shows there are some kind of
deficiencies found in the heaven.
Once Durvasa Rishi, on being pleased with Mridugal
Rishi, blessed him with a place in heaven. The messenger
came to him in a plane and requested him to accompany
him to the heaven. Mridugal asked him to first give him a
brief account of heaven.
The messenger, describing the pleasures to be found
in heaven, said __
There are beautiful gardens to be found all around.
One can find many kinds of beautiful and fragrance giving
flowers and fruit there. One can eat the fruits of one’s
choice. The atmosphere is very much charming. Many
beautiful waterfalls are seen flowing at different places.


110 Sahib Bandgi
No kinds of diseases are to be found there. Everyone has a
fragrance-giving wreath round his neck. In short, such
kind of pleasures is nowhere to be found in this universe.
Mridugal Rishi became thoughtful and said, “O
messenger! Tell me the shortcomings to be found there.”
The messenger said,” There are three main
shortcomings to be found there. The first one is that those
in lower class envoy the pleasures and facilities enjoyed
by others in the higher class. Secondly, the wreaths round
the neck of all begin to wither as the period of stay there
begins to draw near. This is really a cause of worry for
everyone. So to say, it is a sort of warning for all to be
prepared to go to the mortal world again. Thirdly, there is
no scope for rising high. This is because man goes there to
reap the fruit of noble Karmas performed by him in the
mortal world. No new Karma can be performed there.
Saying so, the messenger became silent.”
Mridugal said,” O messenger! I don’t want to go to
such a kind of heaven. This mortal world is better than the
heaven. I want to attain real salvation so that I may not
have to return to the world repeatedly. You can go back.”
In fact, the heaven as well is a sort of deception. It
can in no way prove helpful in attaining Soul realization.

Q.-98) Where does the Divya Darishti (inner eyes)
located?
A.) Everyone is in possession of it. Often when we
go to the enlightened Souls, we ask them to see with their
Divya Darishti whether they will find success in the work
in hand. Have the sages to see with some special
spectacles? Certainly not. We want them to do so through
their inner eyes (Antakarna or concentration).
You as well are in possession of this Darishti. With
its help you can have a vision of God. Some say, it is
present in the Agya Chakra; some say it is present in the
3rd til (place in- between the eyes) while others speak of


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 111
its presence at some other points. In fact, this Divya
Darishti is present in our Surti. That is why we talk of
Surti Yog. This Divya Darishti will open only when our
concentration gets firmly fixed. It will then help us attain
Soul realization. Nevertheless, the Mind, remaining
hidden, prevents us from fixing our concentration. It does
so by reminding us of some worldly things. The second
part of this Surti (called as Nirti ) is within our body. The
two have to be united to make the Divya Darishti open.
That is to say, the Surti has to be drawn from the outer
world and the Nirti has to be brought to its proper position
so that the two can be united.
Just as one loses the power to see when the Cataract
(Motiabind) appears in the eyes, in the same manner, the
devotee loses the power to open the Divya Darishti when
the Mind casts a veil over it. Even the real face of Mind
can be seen when the Divya Darishti gets opened.
Sabb ki gathri lal hai...
Every human being has great hidden miraculous powers.

Q.-99) Are the heaven and the hell the creation of
Niranjan?
A.) Yes, Niranjan is the creator as well as the admin-
istrator of the heavens and the hell.
The ever blissful Soul is given the small, unreal and
short lived pleasures in heaven simply to make it forget
the real and permanent pleasures of Sat Lok and to keep it
entangled in the short lived worldly pleasures.
On the other hand, there are Sapat kumbhi Naraks
(hells of 7 kinds) where the Jivas, as per their evil deeds,
are given such tortures as no civilized person of the world
can even dream of. Sometimes they are put in the big
vessels full of hot oil; sometimes they are tortured by
touching them with hot iron; sometimes they are thrown in
pits containing dirt and filth; sometimes they are made to
drink the boiling oil while at other times they are made to


112 Sahib Bandgi
walk over thorns. Just think! Would you like to give your
children such like punishment even if they have
committed serious nature of crimes. What to talk of one’s
own children, none would like to give such tortures even
to the children of others. How can Param Purush ever
think of doing so to the Jivas who are His own parts? It is
Kaal Niranjan alone who, by his nature, seeks pleasure in
doing such acts.

Q.-100) What is Sahaj Samadhi?
A.) Sahaj Samadhi means an easy way of medita-
tion. There is no difficulty in this practice. Yog is difficult
to perform. To understand the Sahaj Samadhi there is need
to understand as to what the Yogis do. At first, they
observe a fast. Then they cleanse the 6 Chakras in the
body by removing the filth from there. After this they sit
in a tub of water and cleanse the anal internal passage by
purging with water. Then they cleanse the penis with milk.
They do so by taking milk in and out. Then they insert a
cloth with length equal to 9 fingers into it the throat and
clean the heart chakra. Then they take a Dhoti with length
equal to 7 hands and take it in and out through the mouth.
Then they wash it with water. They repeat this activity
thrice it cleanses their intestines, throat, heart and Anhad
Chakra. After this they draw in water through the current
Swar (flowing breath)—Ida or Pingla, remove it through
the other and thereby cleanse the Agya Chakra. After
doing all this, they Sit on a piece of cloth (Asan) and
drawing the breath upward, open the Sushumna. In the
vital force (pranas) resides the Soul. They stop all physical
of activity. This is really a very difficult job. How many
people will be able to practice it? No doubt, many people
won’t be able to do it. After remaining hungry for two
days, this Kriya (activity ) has to be performed for one day
and then the meditation has to be done.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 113
In the Sahaj Yog I am talking about, the recitation
has to be done through every breath. Such recitation will
remove the blockage of mucus and the breath will start
moving in the reverse direction. The moving up of the
breath will enable one enter in the state of Samadhi
(Concentration). This is called as the Sahaj Samadhi.

Q.- **101) Isn’t the act of leaving one** 's Guru and
seeking the shelter of some other is like an act of
**leaving one’s husband** and seeking some other?
A.) This question arises when you shun your Satguru
and get entangled in worshiping others. In fact, shunning
the Guru who has entangled you in the Kaal related
worship and seeking the shelter of Satguru who blesses
you with Naam related to Param Purush, is just like
leaving the unreal husband and returning back to the real
husband. It can in no case be considered as an act of
seeking the shelter of some other husband. Here you have
to ponder whether you are worshipping your own husband
or improper one. Sahib Kabir has talked about worship
that is entirely different from that of Sagun or Nirgun. The
kinds of worship prevalent in the world are all related to
Kaal Purush. They are, so to say, just like the worship of
unreal husband. The real husband of Soul is none else but
Param Purush whose part it is. That is to say, the worldly
people are not worshiping their real husband. They want
to remain under the shelter of such Gurus who do not
posses the power to enable them meet their real husband
(loved one). That is why, under the misconceptions
created in their minds, they think the seeking of shelter of
some real Satguru by leaving their Guru is just like an act
of shunning their husband. Strange thing to note is that the
people don’t know as to who their real husband is.
Dadu dyal Ji says _
Purush Hamara Ek Hai, Hum Nari Bahu Ung
The husband of all of us is Param Purush alone.


114 Sahib Bandgi
Sahib Kabir says—
Jabb Tak Guru Miley Nehin Sancha,
Tabb Tak Guru Karo Dus Pancha
You can seek the shelter of more than one Guru by
the time you succeed in finding the real Guru (Satguru).

Q.-102) Sant Satguru is also a human being. As
such, how can he be expected to come and take the
Soul of the disciple to Amarlok after the discipal
departs from the world?
A.) Those who take the Sant Satguru as an ordinary
human being, lack intellect. The Satguru you are related
with, occupies the (8th) Ashtam Chakra. He is not a body.
His visible body is only a sort of veil. This is because the
entire abode of Niranjan will disappear if there were no
such a veil. Then all the Jivas will reach Amarlok. That
appearance is so much attractive that all will get absorbed
into it if that veil is lifted.
Nevertheless, Niranjan’s worlds are not to be made
desolate. All that is needed is to make the Beings
understand in a well planned manner and that too without
lifting the veil. He who understands, moves ahead on his
path to Sat Lok. The Satguru makes you understand
through the medium of this very body. As such, you
should fix your concentration at his very appearance of
him without trying to point out any distinction between
Param Purush and the Satguru. Remember! At the last
moment he will come to take you in the bodiless form.

Q.- **103) Can’t we take the incarnations in the**
world as the incarnations of God Himself?
A.) All that are nothing but illusions They were the
incarnations of Niranjan. He does all this to maintain his
glory in his 3 Lokas.
The worldly people say He incarnates in the world
but Sahib Kabir says—


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 115
Dashrath Kul Autar Nehin Aaya,
Nehin Lanka Ke Rav Sataya
Prithvi Raman Dhaman Nehin Keriya,
Paithi Patal Na Bali Chhaliya
Ei Sub Kam Sahib Ke Nahin,
Jhut Kahey Sansara.
That Param Purush didn’t incarnate Himself in the
house of Dashrath. Neither He killed Ravan, the ruler of
Lanka nor He cheated the king Bali even. All such acts
were performed by Niranjan himself.
Janam Maran Se Rahit Hai, Mera Sahib Soye
Balihari Us Peev Ki, Jin Sirja Sub Koye
That Sahib (Param Purush) neither gets created nor
gets destroyed. I bow before that Sahib who created
everything.
Only some rare assayer can assay Him. That Param
Purush alone is the real and true well wisher of the Soul.
Think over the words. Sahib Kabir says that our real
beloved one doesn’t visit the world. That is to say, he
doesn’t take birth from the womb of mother. Neither He
has any parents nor He has been created by anyone. He is
neither a sage, worshiper or some Yogi nor does He
perform any rites and rituals like other worldly people. He
is far distinguished from the 4 Ashrams as well. Neither
He becomes a child nor does He grow young or old. None
can say anything about His age. He is beyond the
Tridevas, Sohang, Nirakar and the like. He is even
different from the Maya and Brahm.
He is different from Jyoti Niranjan, Aum, the earth,
the Sun, the Stars, elements and other such like things. He
is present in all beings but remains invisible. Only the
Naam blessed by the Satguru can reveal His identity.

Q.-104) If this universe is dream like, then the
stars, the moon and the like must be the same. Then


116 Sahib Bandgi
the Guru too must be dream. Then what should be
taken as the truth?
A.) This world is like a dream. This is because noth-
ing stays here for ever. These physical eyes are unreal. As
such, all that you see with them is also unreal. This dream
is a very long one. Sahib Kabir says —
Chander Surya Bhas Swapan, Panch Mein Prapanch Swapan
Swarg Au Narak Beech Basey Sau Swapan Roop Hain
The Sun, the Moon, the Heaven and the Hell are
nothing but a farce. In fact, the state in which you are
sitting is also a delusion.
Auhang Au Sauhang Swapan, Pind Aur Brahmand Swapan
Atma Permatma Swapan, Roop So Aroop Hai
Even the Soul and God are dream like. This is
because after the absorption of the Mind in the Hansa, the
latter has been called as Atma.
That is why the Soul has been called as dream like.
Even God is a dream like because he is Niranjan, the ruler
of the illusionary 3 worlds. However, the Satguru is not
dream, because his integrated awareness is accessed in
Surti. Sahib Kabir says—
Kahat Kabir Sun Gorakh Bachan Mum
Swapan Se Parey Satya Satya Roop Bhoop Hai
Soyi Satya Nam Satya Lok Beech Vasa Karey
Nehin Kahoon Aavey Nehin Javey Satya Roop Hai
That Satya Naam itself is the only truth. Its abode is
eternal, Amarlok that never perishes. It is beyond the limit
of deluding Mind. Therefore it the truth and is real.

3 The Religious Scriptures-Veda do
```
not know the secret related to My

World
In the holy Quran we find a mention of ‘Bechuna
Khuda’. Bechuna means Nirakar. Isa Masih as well has
called God as his heavenly father and himself as his only
son. Heavenly God as well means Nirakar.
The Vedas talk about the Nirakar ( formless ) God.
All our religious scriptures are speaking about the
Formless God alone. However, you should know that this
Nirakar whom the worldly people call as God, is the
creator of 84 Lakh Yonis (Kind of Beings). The truth is
that the Surti that provides the needed energy to create
consciousness in the Yonis is something different.

Karam Aur Bharam Sansaar Sab Karat Hai,
Peev Ki Parakh Koi Sant Jaaney.
Sahib Ji says that the whole world is busy in doing
karma and is wandering in confusion in search of Supreme
Lord. Whereas, only a true living Sant has the true
realization of Supreme Lord (Sahib) and completely
knows about His true presence, appearance and existence.

Sahib Kabir has described this Nirakar creator as—
Munn hi Nirakar, Niranjan janiye
Munn itself is the Nirakar Niranjan
All take ultimate Salvation as the attainment of Nira-
kar- formless God. The Sahib Bandgi Panth agrees in the
existence of Nirakar but it also throws light on that which
lies beyond formless. Sahib Kabir has talked about that
which is rare and different from the Nirakar, the Sagun
the Nirgun mode of worship and the related 5 Mudras.
_Duniya Jisko ‘Paramatma’ Maaney,
Sohi ‘Kaal’ Koi Bheid Na Jaaney._


118 Sahib Bandgi
Sahib Ji says that the ‘Power’ who is ruling over the
universe, to whom the whole world considers and worship
as ‘God’; is no one else but ‘Kaal Purush’ (God of
Death/Mind). This secret is unknown to the whole of
mankind.
Is Ke Aage Bheid Hamara, Janey Ga Koyi Jananhara
Kahey Kabir Janey Ga Soi, Ja Per Kripa Satguru Ki Hoi
Sahib Kabir says that the secret related to him lies
far beyond this and only some disciple, who has with him
the grace of a Satguru, can know of it.
The Sants have given the universe the secret related
to Satya Lok (True World), path of real salvation and the
11th Dwara (State) that lies beyond the 10th one (Door of
Inner Vision to Cosmos).
Bhakti-Bhakti Sab Jagat Bakhana,
Bhakti Bheid Koi Virla Jaana.
The whole world is worshiping God in their own
ways. But, only the rare being realises about the real
secret behind the true worship of Supreme Lord
Our Panth gives much higher mode of devotion or
real worship after making them understand clearly the
difference between the bodily(Spoken and written) Naam
related to the Kaal Purush and the Sar Naam (Soundless
Sound) related to Param Purush.
Kag Palat Hansa Ker Deena,
Aisa Purush Nam Main Deena
Akah Nam Likha Na Jayi, Pada Na Jayi,
Bin Satguru Koyi Nahi Payi
Sahib Kabir says that he blesses the devotees with
the rare Alive Naam related to Param Purush, that can
neither be read nor reduced to writing. Moreover, none but
a Satguru has the power to bless the devotees with that
Sajeevan Naam.
Sada Anand Hot Hai Va Ghar
Amarlok is eternally blissful

## 4. I visit this universe in every Yuga

Those who don't know me, often on hearing about
me from my critics say that Ranjdi wala says he is all in
all. Though I have never said so, yet there is some logic in
what they say. If you think in a rational way, you will find
that I am making my devotees follow me. That is why
others feel so.
A certain individual phoned me saying that he
wanted to speak to Madhu Param Hans Ji. I asked him to
say what he wanted. He said that he wanted to talk to
Madhu Param Hans Ji. This is because normally it is the
PAs’ who first attend the phone. As such, he thought some
PA might have attended it. I said that I was Madhu Param
Hans. Still he expressed some doubt. His tone was not a
pleasant one. At first, I thought of disconnecting the call,
as I didn’t like to talk to such a bad mannered man. Then I
thought perhaps it may be his habit. I asked him to spell
his doubt. He said that I called myself as the incarnation
of Sahib Kabir. What was the proof. I said that I never
said so. He said that my disciples said so. I said that I take
him also like Kabir. Kabir is the name of the flawless
awakened force that is present in all.
Kakka Kewal Naam Hai, Babba Baran Sharir.
R-Ra Sabb Mein Rum Raha, Taka Naam Kabir.
According to a holy saint, Kabir is another Name of
the awareness-chetan shakti present in every Individual.
Kabir means that which has no material body. He
said that I also say that the thing I possess is not to be
found anywhere else in the universe. I said that he was
listening to all that others were speaking. I talk about a
pure thing. Our identity is different from that of others.
Had I said I give the devotees a Power at the time of
blessing them with Naam, he wouldn’t have understood it.


120 Sahib Bandgi
He asked many questions. Then he attended a
Satsang at Jalandhar. I was speaking about this very topic.
He stood up and said that he was that very fellow. Then he
got blessed with Naam.
Sahib Kabir had descended on the earth to make the
Humanity understand the glory of Naam.
Ni Aksher Te Karai Nibera, Kahe Kabir Soyi Jann Mera
Sahib Kabir says that he takes such a individual who
are blessed with the Sar Naam, as his own.
Shabad Bheid Janey Jo Koyi, Sar Shabad Mein Rahe Samoyi
He who understands and recognizes the real and true
Naam (Sar Naam) as distinguished from other worldly
Naams, remains absorbed in it.
Sahib Kabir told Dharam Dass about the 13 Yugas
(prior to the 1st Satya Yug of this universe ) he visited this
universe even before the appearance of Satya Yug. These
Yugas are _

1. Adasur Yug 2. Balbhaddar Yug. 3. Doonder Yug
4. Purvan Yug 5. Anuman Yug 6. Dheeryamal Yug 7.
   Taran Yug 8. Akhil Yug 9. Vishva Yug 10. Akshya Taran
   Yug 11. Nandi Yug 12. Hindol Yug 13. Kankvat Yug.
   To satisfy the great curiosity of Dharam Dass, Sahib
   Kabir told him about the 4 Yugas related to Kalap Yugam.
   He said that Niranjan again and again created the universe
   and killed and ate the Beings after giving them much
   tortures. The pitiable cries of the Beings reached Param
   Purush Who sent him to the universe to bring the Beings
   to Amarlok after blessing them with the Sar Naam.
1. Sat Yug;- In Satya Yug, Geyani Ji (Kabir Sahib)
   came to the universe with Satya Sukrit as name. The
   period of Satya Yug was 17 Lakh years. Here the people
   had a height of 21 hands. In this Yug, Chiter-rekha, the
   wife of King Mitter Sain, was blessed with Naam. At her
   instance, the king too was blessed with Naam. Sahib Kabir
   sent both of them to Sat Lok. The King Batkheter and
   King Harchand also found a place in Sat Lok. The fourth

one to reach there was a milk maid, Viksi by name. She
was from Mathurapuri. These Hansas on their turn, helped
9 Lakh other Hansas reach Amarlok.

2. Treta Yug:- In this Yug, Geyani Ji came to the
   universe as Muninder Muni. He described 12 Lakh 96
   thousand years as the period of this Yug. Here the people
   had a height of 14 hands. In this Yug, Lakshman Ji and
   Madhokar of Ayodhya, Mandodri, the wife of Ravan,
   Guru Vashishath and Durvasa Muni were blessed with
   Naam and reached Sat Lok.
3. Dwaper Yug:- In this Yug, he came to the
   universe as Karunamay. The period of this Yug was 6
   Lakh 64 thousand years. The people had a height of seven
   hands. Indumati, the wife of king Chander Vijay, king
   Yudhishter, Prashar rishi, King Dhundhul, Paras Dass and
   his wife were among those who got blessed with Naam.
   He gave Spiritual Wisdom to Garud Ji and blessed him
   with Vihang Naam. Hari Dass Supuch, Shuk Dev, Vidur,
   King Bhoj, king Muchkund, King Chanderhas and four
   milk maids also got blessed with Naam and reached
   Amarlok. All of them came to the universe as Gurus
   and floating the true Panth helped 52 Lakh Jivas attain
   Salvation.
4. Kali Yug:- In this Yug, Geyani Ji came to the uni-
   verse as Sahib Kabir to create awakening among the Jivas.
   The period of this Yug is 4 Lakh 32 thousand years. The
   average age of man is 100 years and his height is at the
   most three and a half hands. Here the age is not fixed.
   People pay less attention to worship. All sorts of strange
   things happen here. The sages are seen envying other
   Sages. That is why they remain entangled in the 84 Lakh
   Yonis. Only some rare devotee is able to recognize the
   truth. All others will envy the devotee who gets blessed
   with the true Naam. Many unreal Sages in the guise of
   Sadhus will cheat and mislead the devotees in the name of


122 Sahib Bandgi
religion. Calling themselves as Sants, the Sages will beg
from others and will indulge in lustful activities.
Sahib Kabir cleared all the misconceptions of
Dharam Dass related to truth. Others whose
misconceptions were removed, were—

1. Guru Gorakh Nath 2. Shah Balakh Bukhari, a
   great scholar of Arbi language 3. Swami Rama Nand, his
   guru 4. Sikander Lodhi, the disciple of Sheikh Takki 5.
   Apart from it, he crushed the ego of Sheikh Takki by
   allowing him to have his real vision. 6. Blessed the king
   Veer Sing Baghel, the ruler of Kashi 7. Blessed Nawab
   Bijli Khan of Awadh 8. Enabled the King Kanak Sing
   along with his 16 wives reach Amarlok. 9. Helped the
   King of Bhopal along with his 11 wives attain Sat Lok.
10. Helped Ratnabai, a sweet seller attain Sat Lok. 11.
    Enabled Mohammad Sahib cross 7 skies. 12. The washer
    man Ali Dass along with 7 other Jivas also got blessed
    with Naam and reached Sat Lok. 13. Revealed the hidden
    secret to Nanak Dev Ji. 14. Revealing the significance of
    Naam to Damodar Dass, helped him attain salvation.
    Through them he helped 5 Lakh Jivas attain salvation.
    In Dwaper Yug, Before the incarnation of Krishn Ji,
    Vishnu Ji created 16 thousands milk maids. All of them,
    decorating their bodies, were singing in the glory of Hari.
    Krishn Ji took birth in Gokul in the house of Vasdev. King
    Kansa asked Kagasur to damage the eyes of his enemy,
    Krishn Ji. Kagasur reached the place where Krishn Ji was
    busy playing with his small friends. Seeing the devil,
    Krishn Ji simply embraced him and he died on the spot.
    When Pootna, the wife of Kagasur came to kill him, he
    took in all the poison attached to her breasts and killed
    her. Likewise, he killed Bakasur within a moment. He
    didn’t leave any devil alive. He lifted the entire mountain
    on his finger when the God Inder continued to cause
    rainfall for 7 days. Inder Dev begged pardon for his
    wrong act. One day he was busy grazing the cows and


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 123
calves on the bank of river Kalinadi. The animals felt
thirsty and went to the stream to quench their thirst. The
bodies of all of them became affected with poison. Krishn
Ji was astonished to see this and he himself went to drink
water. His body turned grayish black. He descended into
the stream and catching hold of the python, sent it to Patal.
A disciple, who is in the shelter of a Satguru, can
understand the reality behind such actions of Krishn Ji.
He killed Shishu Pal. So to say, all the miraculous
activities of Hari in all his incarnations appear related to
the repeated births and deaths and the desire to take
revenge. Man, taking all this as a glimpse of the
superpower of Hari, takes him as the liberator.
Remaining entangled in the Mayajal of these
miraculous things, man fails to attain the knowledge
related to Param Purush of the 4th Loka. It is only the
Satguru who gives knowledge about Amarlok, the real
abode of Hansa. After attaining real salvation nothing like
taking revenge, performing of Karmas and the like
remains to be done. The repeated cycle of births and
deaths, the deeds performed by the incarnations and the
like are related to Nirakar Niranjan, the Lord of the 3
Lokas.
Kaal Saban Ko Grasyo, Vachan Kahyo Samjhaye
Kahain Kabir Main Ka Karun, Dekh Nehin Patiyae
Sahib Kabir says that Kaal is devouring all but he
feels helpless as the Jivas don’t try to understand all this
even after watching all this with their own eyes..
Sahib Kabir has been coming to the universe in the
guise of a Satguru since Yugas together to make the jivas
understand the Mayaic net of Niranjan and the miseries
one has to suffer here. He feels sad to see whole of the
world engrossed in the acts of hypocrisy and dreams of
attaining salvation through the unreal modes of worship
instead of following the real one.


124 Sahib Bandgi
Krishn Ji, with the help of the Pandvas, made all the
armies of the Kaurvas and the Pandvas suffer death. Even
the great donor like Karun, Ganga Puttar Bhisham and the
Guru Daronacharya were killed. He caused all this to
happen by creating misconceptions and misunderstandings
in the minds of others.
Only the Pandvas survived. Niranjan called krishn Ji
through his Surti. In Surti, Krishan Ji meditated on
Niranjan at a place far away from Heaven where there is
no existence of shunya, sun, moon and the like. He said,”
O Nirakar Niranjan! You reside in all. You are the creator
of the 5 materials as well as of Shunya. You yourself are
Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, the beginning and the end, the
Gods and the like. Please give me your dictates.” Krishn Ji
heard a word from across the skies which said that he had
sent him to annihilate the demonic men thereby giving
relief to the earth.
Krishna Kahey Sunu Purush Purana
Kal Abhey Kaha Mor Thikana
Krishn Ji asked as to what was his own position on
the earth. Niranjan said that he is his part and resided in
him.
Marhu Yadav Vansh Kaha, Mano Vachan Rasaal
Gopi Jaai Sanharo, Tehi Panchey Tuv Kal.
Niranjan asked Krishna to destroy the Yadavas and
also the Gopikas and to finish them all. In the mortal
world, he should kill all the unjust, evil natured and
powerful persons through even deceitful ways.
This has to be done again and again till the short
term Kali Yug appears. In Kali Yug the man will have a
weak body and a short span of life. In this period, it is you
who will be worshiped and things will happen as per your
will. That is why you have been empowered to rule the
earth. Establish your rule at Jagan Nath without any delay
because you will have to leave your body before the
arrival of Sahib Kabir.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 125
Shri Krishn was astonished to know of it in his
meditation. He asked as to who Sahib Kabir was before
whose arrival he had to leave his body. Niranjan, the
creator, told him that all the Rishi Munies, Gunn,
Gandharb etc. would come to have food when the Pandvas
will perform the Jajya after attaining victory in war. But
the Yagya won’t reach its final completion. This will
happen because none among those present there would be
found to have the knowledge about the real and true Naam
related to Param Purush. In Kal Yug, only Sahib Kabir
will describe the glory of Naam. With the spiritual
knowledge related to Param Purush, Supuch, the disciple
of Sahib Kabir, will make the Yagya reach its completion
after partaking the food. He himself will remain as his
companion. He also said that during his incarnation as
Ram, he had killed Bali. That Bali as incarnation of
Veyad, will take revenge with him. After this, Krishan Ji,
reached the city of Dwaraka.
As directed by Niranjan, he got the Yagya done by
Pandavas. It was performed due to killing of Kinsman.
Krishn ji instructed for serving food.
Baithey Gandharva Dev Gan, Rishi Munivar Sab Jhar
Sab Mili Kinha Bhojan, Icha Ke Anusaar
All the Rishis, Munis and Devatas partaken food to
their satisfaction.

however the bell did not ring to indicate satisfactory
conclusion of Yagya therefore, Raja Yudhishthir felt sense
of Shame. Krishnji told to look for a devotee who sings
the glory of Satguru. Bring him with all reverence and
offer him food. Listening to Krishna, Yudhishthir sent a
messenger to look for a devotee of Satguru but they could
not locate anyone. Then Bhima went on search and
reached Kashi and he saw a devotee named Supach.
Supach spent all the time singing the glory of Satguru.
Kahey Bheem Sun Harijan, Kripa Karo Mam Sanga.

irritated and walked away abusing him. On return, he told

Krishn ji, for the fear of you, I did not kill him.Listening
to Bhima, Krishn ji smiled.
Jiv Yudhishthir Ved Gey, Tum Aano Gahi Pai.

Then Krishnaji asked Yudhishthir to go and request.
Following his command, he went to Supach.
Aho Sant Tajiye Apradha, Adham Udaran Suniyat Sadha.

He pleaded with Supach to forgive him for the
mistake and requested Supach to grace his house which
will benefit his family. Supach asked- Oh King of Pandav,
what work do you have? Yudhishthir said- You are a
Paramarthi (Spiritualist) therefore I am confident that you
will come and grace us. Pleased with the Yudhishthir,
Supach went along with him, King Yudhishthir washed
the feet of Supach and served him with five varities of
food. When Supach pertook the meal and just stood up,
the bell rang indicating the successful completion of the
Yagya. After which completion of Yagya, Krishna
reached Dwaraka.
Buzo Rey Nar Parani, Kya Supchai Adhikar.
Gan Gandharva Muni Dev Rishi, Sab Mili Kinha Ahaar.
Oh Men! What is the uniqueness of Supach, when he
pertook the food, the yagya was fulfilled. The bell did not
ring even when Gan-Gandharv, Muni, Devta, Rishi and
Krishna pertook the food.

When they all took the food, the bell did not rang
because none of them knew the greatness of Naam.
Supach knew the greatness of Naam therefore when he
took the food, the Bell rang and the Yagya was complete.
The world is devoted to Krishna and others, but Oh wise
ones, understand our "Naam". No one can escape without
Satya Naam.
FOUR GOALS OF LIFE
Sastras talk of four Purusharthas as the goals of life.
These four duties of man are Dharma, Artha, Kama, and
Moksha (Righteousness, Wealth, Desire, and Salvation)'
any learned scholar will tell us that among these four
Purusharthas, the object on which we should concentrate,
is moksha or liberation or Salvation. If Moksha is the
supreme and ultimate objective, why mention Artha and
Kama also? It is not as if there is no meaning for these two
words, Artha and Karma. They are required to take care of
the elemental body while on earth, but if one neglect
Dharma (Rules and Limits) and Moksha, the basis and the
goal, then Artha and Kama will become harmful. Satya
Naam from a Satguru help attain all the four Purushartas
meaningfully. Moksha is reaching that eternal world,
Amarlok, our final destination- Param moksh.

## 5. Four Purushratas with Satya Naam

Ni-akshar Koi Paar Na Pavey| Kahan Sunnan Se Nyaara Hey||
What sort of a "Naam" is that? That cannot be
written or heard.
Ni-akshar Bhed Aanami Kahiye, Aagam Agochar Soyi|
Taaka Bhed Sant Koi Jaaney, Jakhi Surti Samoyi||
Only some rare Sant is aware about Naam
(Soundless Sound); not others.

Sahib Kabir says that this Naam cannot be uttered
with mouth. It can neither be spoken nor written in
alphabets.

Whatever is there in the Three Worlds is under the
rulership of Kaal Purush. Citizen of any country are bound
by the laws of that country. This is the world of Kaal
Purush. Therefore, his rules and regulations are imposed
on every being. This is not the world of Soul. Where there
is Birth and Death, there is Illusion and Karma. Kabir
Sahib said
Yah Sansaar Kaal Ko Desha||
Kaal Purush is the ruler of this Universe.
Yaha Karm Ka Jaal Pasara Hey||
This universe is full of misery.
Yak Lokh Yak Ved Do Dariya Ke Kinarey|
Saayad Ke Kabhu Mey Hey Sab Jiv Vicharey||
Here all are under the delusive influence of Kaal
Purush, deluded by Maya and under the sway of Desires,
Anger and Lust. The world of Soul, Amarlok is free from
all the Vices.
Avadhu Bagam Desh Humara Hey|
Ved Kiteb Paar Nahi Pavat, Kahan Sunnan Se Nyara Hey||


130 Sahib Bandgi
Wherever Five elements exits, it is bound to
disintegrate because element destroys other elements.
Water will destroy Earth; Fire will destroy Water; Air will
extinguish the Fire; Space will dissolve the Air. It
indicates, that they are all mutually destructive. Wherever
these five elements exist, there will be dissolution.
However, there is no dissolution in Amarlok. There is no
Illusion, Physical body, Birth or Death in Amarlok. Here
in the World, one has to give-up his Body. Soul is
embodied in a complicated and dirty condition. It is
unaware of the full consequences of Karma. The inner
vices (Desire, Anger, Greed, Lust, Hate and Pride) impels
and influences all actions. There is a well meaning Film
song.
Jindagi Kya Hey Gham Ka Dariya|
Na Jina Yaha Buss Mey, Na Marna Yaha Buss Mey||
This worldly ocean of life is full of misery. Here
neither Life is in one's control or his Death. It is evident
that the Soul is under the grip of antagonistic forces;
clothed in body, the Soul is made to wander. In this
Creation, there are various wombs of Beings, which are
miserable. There are 84lakh such beings made in the
creation. Soul has to pass through such karmic beings.
What all wombs it has to pass through. It is evident that
the Soul is in great distress. Sahib Kabir's words are full of
revelations of truth. These are called Worlds of Kaal
Purush. There are immense difficulties in Life here in the
World; it is full of misery. What kind of a Karma is this
Birth and Death! What sort of a delusion created by the
wombs! The Soul which has the essence and part of the
Supreme Lord, has to take birth as an Ant. What kind of a
Wrenched Wombs, Soul has to pass through! Even a
simple enquiry will make it clear that Soul is being
deluded. In Truth, this Universe is not the Home of Soul.
The condition here is very cruel. Soul has no satisfaction
here. In this World, Soul is deliberately put in delusion.


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 131
What are your Complaints? Physical problems; the
difficulties, hardships and the worries; - all these have no
relevance to the Soul. Human Beings are afflicted with
only such problems. Niranjan has the power to bestow
Wealth and other Worldly things. He can grant
Miraculous Powers like Riddhi-Siddhi. The God-Cosmic
Mind wishes that individual Being should not seek the
Soul. The one who is addressed having Form or Formless
is the same one who put this Soul into Worldly Delusions.
Sahib Kabir clearly says:
Manhi Niranjan Manhi Omkaar Manhi Hey Kartara||
Teen Lokh Mey Manhi Viraji| Tahi Na Chinat Pandit Kaaji||
Niranjan is the ruler of the Three Worlds and has
all the Wealth in his control. Why is it that, he grants the
prayer of an Individual with all these things? Because, he
will believe that the God has answered his prayer.
However, he does not wish that one will attain the
awareness of Soul. What can he give? Money, Position,
Miraculous Power and many more things; but never the
awareness of the Soul.
All prayers will reach upto Nirakar Niranjan. He
will grant all desires (Son-Daughter, House, Physical
pleasure and Worldly Wealth) but never the Knowledge of
Soul. With the Devotion on him, one can attain this
worldly and other worldly pleasures. Sahib says:
Chaar Padart Ek Mag Mahi| Kahey Kabir Koi Janat Naahi||
Those embraces the Satya-Bhakti of Sant Satguru
with Naam Diksha, they attains all the four Purushatrhas.
Gyaan Dhayan Tehi Mahi Samavey||
One can attain all the Powers of the Soul(
Adhyathmic Power). That is why in ancient times, in the
battle field, they use to enquire as to who is the Guru of
the person in other side. It will indicate the strength and
the power of that person. There is a good example related
to this Concentration-Surti. Eklavya, the Tribal Prince
approached Guru Dronacharya to learn Archery.


132 Sahib Bandgi
Dronacharya refused to teach him the lessons. He being a
hunter, he is likely to harm the Birds and Beasts of the
Jungle with that skill. He does not want to impart such
skill, so he told him that he only teaches Royal Princes.
Eklavya replied that he is also the Prince of a King of
Forest Hunter but Dronacharya did not give. Eklavya
made a statue of Dronacharya and concentrating on him
learnt fine skills of Archery. This Concentration-Surti is
not an ordinary thing. Therefore, even Humans want to
draw the power of Paramatma by concentrating on him.
Just as Electricity is transmitted through a wire, similarly
these powers can be transmitted through concentration.
Even, the mother of Gopichand asked him to
anchor on a strong nail. He said that he is living as a
Sanyasi. Which strong nail you are talking about? She
asked him to be in the company of a complete Guru and to
meditate on him. He is the strongest nail of support.
Satguru Din Dayalji, Tum Lagh Meri Dawdh
Jaisey Kaag Jahaj Par, Sujat Katahu Na Taor||
Therefore, the concentration is the Soul. Wherever,
we keep our unwavering concentration that we will attain.
Jaaki Surat Laag Rahe Jahava,
Kahey Kabir Pahunchau Tahava
Satguru is a strong anchor. Therefore, one should
keep their concentration on him while engaged in all
activities. That way we will stay unaffected by Maya.
Even Vedas and Scriptures say;
Dhyan Moolam Guru Roopam, Pooja Moolam Guru Padakam,
Mantra Moolam Guru Vakyam, Moksha Moolam Guru Kripa||
Meditate on Real Guru (Satguru). Worship his
Holy feet. Take his word as Mantra. Attain Salvation by
his Grace.
Therefore, Satguru is full and free manifestation of
power of eternal Soul. One pointed concentration is Soul.
Soul has the power to see, to move and to hear. Even
Vasudev Krishanji says-'Aantmatta Saagta||' wherever one


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 133
concentrates at death, there they will reach. If one
concentrates on Satguru, they will reach him. It is
impossible to concentrate on Supreme Purusha because he
is behond comprehension and Mind cannot reach him.
Therefore, she asked Gopichand to be in the Satsang of a
complete Guru. Sahib Kabir says;
Saat Dweep Nav Khand Mey, Guru Sey Bada Na Koy|
If the Guru is complete, one will attain completion.
There is none in the Universe who is greater than such
Guru.
Guru Milne Se Jagada Katam Ho Gaya||
The complete power of Soul will manifest from
within the individual with the grace of Guru. 90% of the
children will inherit the diesease of their mother acquired
in the womb, because the body of the child is created from
the blood supply of the Mother. The food for child is
given through the Naval, to which Naadis are connected.
Therefore, whatever defficiencies Mother has will afflict
the foetus. Similarly, concentration on the Satguru will
draw his powers and mould the disciple like the Guru
himself.
Therefore, Veda asks to meditate on one's Guru. It
does not say; meditate on Ganeshji, meditate on Vishnuji,
meditate on Shakti ji, meditate on Shivji. Sahib Kabir
says;
Saar Shabdh Sabse Hey Nyaara, Bhed Na Pavey Koi
Chaar Vedh Mey Bhrama Bhuley, Aadi Naam Na Payi.
Its a great revelation.
Bhramadik Shiv Sankadik, Aj Surr Kaal Ke Gunn Gavahi|
Jo Kal Jivan Ko Satavahi, Tasu Bhakti Drudavahi||
Pandits and Kazis are unaware, all the three worlds
are in the domain of Kalpurush (Lord of Death). His
Demonic power runs the world. The same evil force has
bound the Soul within its power. Even if one takes 50 dips
in a Holy stream, this power will not free the Soul.
Bhavsagar Ka Paar, Naam Bina Pavey Nahi||


134 Sahib Bandgi
None can cross the worldly ocean of Birth and
Death without Sajeevan Naam. Further he says-
Aadi Naam Ki Aadbhut Mahima, Surti Nirati Se Payi|
Sahib Kabir Amarpur Vasi, Hansa Lokh Patayi||
One reaches that Unique Holy and alive Naam with
Surati and Nirati. Sahib Kabir says that he has desendent
from the Amarlok (beyond the expanding Universe).
Paras Surati Sant Ke Pasa||
The Guru who has his Paras Surati manifested can
also help disciple manifest his Surati (Concentration).
Sahib Kabir affirms-
Paras Mein Aru Sant Mein, Tu Bado Antro Jan|
Veh Loha Kanchan Kare, Veh Karle Aap Saman||
Satguru will transform his disciple like himself. A
real Mahatma-Sant will have this Paras Surti with them.
This Paras Surti will free and awaken the Soul.
Koti Janam Ka Paant Ta, Guru Paal Mey Diya Pahunchay.
It is said, without a Guru one cannot attain wisdom.
What is this Wisdom? If I ask How they will attain this
wisdom from Guru they say that they attain wisdom to
discriminate between good and evil. No, one can attain
this wisdom with the help of elders of the family.
However, one attains knowledge of Soul (Adhyatmik
Wisdom) only from a Real Guru. The inner vices like
Anger, Hatred, Lust,etc cannot come under control of such
persons. After Guru bestoves the Naam, arising of such
tendencies in mind, can be easily apperhended, by the
manifestation of Wisdom of the Soul. Then it can be read
and understood and one becomes aware of activities of the
Mind. When in Anger, one gets engaged in action and
later we repent for the wrong. However, after the Naam
Diksha we become aware of the game of these vices
beforehand. When Anger and Hatred arises, we become
alert. This is Wisdom-Gyaan. Therefore, one's
concentration is awakened for eternity. In this state, all


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 135
becomes clear. Otherwise, the entanglement of Mind is
difficult to comprehend. Sahib says-
Gan Gandharv Rishi Muni Aru Deva,
Sab Mil Lag Niranjan seva.
Peer Paigambhar Kutub Aouliya,
Manhi Niranjan Sabko Daliya
Sidha Sadak Aur Yogi Jatti,
Aagey Khoj Na Pavey Raati
Jaay Niranjan Mahi Samaye
Aagey Ka Koi Bhedh Na Paye||
All are entangled with the Mind. Mind never
releases its grip over the Soul. Unwavering concentration
itself is the Soul (free of elements and its natures).
Therefore, Even if we try this Mind does not come under
control; it wanders out in this world. Its grip on the Soul is
very powerful.
Tann Tir Mann Tir Bachan Tir, Surati Nirati Tirr Hoy|
Kahey Kabir Uss Palak Ko, Kalp Na Pavey Koy||
Even those who did very hard penance, were
entangled in the network of Kalpurush. They could not
escape from the grip of Mind.
Manhi Niranjan Manhi Omkar Manhi Hey Kartara||
Formless Mind itself is Formless God of Death. He
is the Omkar and He is the Doer.
This way, all the Souls are within his boundary and
control. He can give material and physical pleasures.
However, He does not want to give the awareness of Soul.
This can be attained only with the grace of a Real Satguru.
"Hai Yaha Satguru Bina Koi, Moksha Ka Daata Nahi|"
It is not a simple statement that It is no one but a
Satguru, who is the giver of salvation.

## 6. NAAM Diksha (Initiation)

When a shopkeeper says that the pepper in my shop
can't be found anywhere else and tells about its originating
places. So the thing which is the topic of discussion does
not belong to this world, it is not be found in these three
worlds (Earth, Heaven and hell). It is from fourth eternal
world, Amarlok. When you possess that thing, all three
things come to you. I have experienced this not once or
twice but million times. There is no doubt in this, it is
guaranteed. When I give Naam to any one (any Class,
color, creed, caste, race, sects and Religions), three things
are assured-

1. Soul and Mind are separated from each other.
2. The attraction of the world declines.
3. There will be complete security.
   The outcome is in front of you. Every Naami
   (Initiate) changes after getting Naam Diksha. Other
   human are dancing on the waves of mind. Mind is very
   effective but it has no control over my Naami. After
   getting Naam, his Soul awakens. My Naamis find
   themselves to be different from others, they find other
   people Ignorant, one moment they are in good mood and
   in another they are in despondent and behave madly. All
   these are because of the powerful grip of the Mind over
   them.
   My Naami gets hold over their mind. During the
   time of Naam Dhan, I separate the Soul from Mind. I
   separate them, then you are able to understand Mind’s
   influence. This work is most difficult in this world which
   cannot be accomplished by everyone. When you begin to
   understand Mind, the world fades away and attraction dies
   out. Then, every Naami feels that there is a protective
   force accompanying him all the time and everywhere. The
   truth is that, the thing I possess does not exist anywhere in


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 137
this universe. This thing frees the grip of the world of
mind and you are able to understand the nature of Soul.

Note :
 At Naam Initiation, enter with an attitude of surrender, be
simple, obedient, and attentive, it may take up to an hour.
 It is customary: to bring a simple Mala for blessing, which
is worn to identify as Naami (It is not used for chanting),
clarify your doubts, be courteous make it short and simple,
save time.
 Guru mantra will be given for Morning and evening
worship. Second Mantra for attaining concentration and the
third, is Sajeeven Sar Naam given through the Paras Suruti
if Satguru, this is Soundless-inadudiable, which releases
the Mind's grip over the Soul.
 When you offer salutation, (Bandgi) make sure you touch
the feet of Guru with your palm, and have eye to eye
contact with Him and receive his rays. Place your
triditional offerings at your Guru's feet with love.
 Karmas of all your lives are cleared, therefore follow the
seven rules (Core of Dharmas), for you will have no
rebirth to reap, which can make remaining life harder
otherwise.
 Rise above the religions and its rituals, (Do not disrespect
them, keep away). Spirituality is about Spirit-Soul and its
Salvation whereas, Religions and divinity is about Mind
and Matter. Meditate on Satguru, with complete faith, rest
is his grace.
 Present your contact details before you leave, to the
volunteers.

138 Sahib Bandgi

SATGURU SRI MADHU PARAMHANS
SAHIB SAYS:
1." I Do Not Consider Myself As Higher Than
You."
(All the Souls are from one Param Purush Therefore all
are Poornam-Complete. Adhyatmik Bhava.)

2." In All The Three Times, Past, Present And The
Future No One Has Transcended My Level".
(When a drop of water falls into that ocean, it becomes
ocean itself, nothing else. It does not matter what time it
falls, In the Past, Present, or Future)

3. "The Thing I Possess Does Not Exist any where
   In this Universe".
   ( Kabir Sahib says Paras Surti Sant Ke Pasa|.There is a
   power in the Surti with Sant Satguru. 'Sajeevan Naam' is
   given by Satguru with his Surati'. This Naam Gives Param
   Moksh. Kaha Na Jahi, Likha Na Jayi. Bin Sarguru Koyi
   Nahin Payi|.True Naam can neither be spoken nor reduced
   to writing. None can get it without a Satguru Par Lagan
   Ko Her Koyi Chahe, Bin Satguru Koyi Par Na Pavey|.All
   want to cross the ocean of births and deaths here but none
   finds the way out without a Satguru.)

## 7. Towards the Truth

The one who sacrifices the individualised "I”
consciousness from the Soul can comprehend awareness
of Atmic principle. It is not difficult to sacrifice things.
home, wife, husband, wealth, fame many people has
sacrificed these but not the individual “I” (I-ness). This
individual self which is based on the perception “I am so
and so” refers to the individual “I”. For this very reason
you are not able to realize your Soul principle. In
forgetting this I-ness, remains the realization of Soul. That
is why; the realized persons are very rare to find in this
world. Believing that “I am the body”, Atma is engaged in
breathing activity for the sustenance of body. Breathing
down the air in to this body, it keeps the body alive. The
nearness of complete, alive Satguru enables the breathing
to turn upward and outward through the body. This
process enables Surti (concentration) and Nirati (the
activity of breathing) to combine and to prevail the
identity of “I” consciousness, ultimately. With this, the
concentration becomes one pointed and peaceful, the “I”
identification will be replaced with Soulfulness.
NOTE :
* Concentration on the center of your forehead (trikuti)
  will never lead to realization of Soul.
  *All the worldly Religions and Religious scriptures talk
  about earning the merits with good deeds, doing various
  yogic practices. Further they talk about three worlds but
  Kabir Sahib’s words of wisdom directs towards simple
  and easy path of permanent salvation.
  *Just as helicopter, airplane, airship and spacecraft lifts
  through the air, there are many ways to travel in the inner
  world. There are different bodies available for travel with
  various speeds and distance. Just like helicopter cannot
  reach the level of pathfinder, these bodies have limitation
  in reach. Helicopter cannot reach outer planets. Similarly,


140 Sahib Bandgi
Sagun (form full), Nirgun (formless) worship and all kinds
of yoga cannot redeem you from the worldly ocean of
Misery. Naam (boat of Satguru) has the capacity to take
the Soul beyond these three worlds and reach Amarlok.
*To concentrate on any point within, the body during
meditation is illusionary and deceptive.
* Five mudras and its names are within the body and the
  soham is also within this. That is why Sahib had spoken
  of bodiless Naam (Videha Naam). He said Soham is not
  true Naam.
  Jo Jann Hoi Hey Jahari, Shabd Lehu Bilgaye,
  Soh Soh Jap Mua, Mithya Janam Gavaye.
  Soh Soh Japey Bade Gyaani,Nirakshar ki Khabar na Jani.
* To meditate on any point within the body will not
  manifest Adhyathmic Shakti but it may manifest Divya
  Shakti. Manifesting any power within the body is the
  power of Niranjan only. With this, one cannot cross the
  worldly ocean of life. That is why Kabir Sahib does not
  approve concentration on points within the body during
  meditation.
* Sahib says “Not to concentrate on the inner sounds”.
  These sounds are heard inside the head and to produce
  sound you need two implements. Where there is sound,
  there is duality and where there is duality, there is illusion.
  Hence sounds are not the ultimate truth.
* Everyone says that “You need to do something”. Some
  asks to earn through merits, some says to do sadhna, some
  ask you to give alms and do sacred acts, some ask you to
  do yagya ( sacrificial offering), some ask to do yoga and
  some ask you to go on pilgrimage. But Kabir Sahib’s
  Sathya bhakti says “You need not to do such things.
  Whatever has to be done will be done by Satguru. This is
  completely different path to salvation (mukti). Because
  with one’s own efforts and meritorious deeds, one cannot
  cross this worldly ocean of life.
  Saath Dweep Nav Khand Mey, Guru Se Bada Na Koi,


Spiritualism. Questions & Answers, 141
Karta Karey Na Kar Sakey, Guru Karey So Hoi.
* If your Guru is a householder, do not expect any
  spiritual (adhyathmic) benefit from him.
  Bandhe Kho Bandha Miley Toh Ghaat Chudavey Khon||
  How can one who himself is under bondage free another.
* I don’t have to give you wisdom after initiation
  (Naamdaan). Know that it is given. Nothing left to give,
  then why satsang (holy congregation)? This is only to
  remind you of does and don’ts. You are given inner spring
  of wisdom. Satsang is for reminding you about pitfalls and
  difficulties on the journey.
* Whenever you meet me, you receive energy from me
  with which you can walk your way. That is why, I come
  among you often.
* Our way is easy way (Sahaj marg) and our path is path
  of bhringa Matt (Bumle bee – known to have only males,
  no females).
* Auspicious sight of Satguru is very useful for he
  bestows his powerful Adhyathmic rays by ways of sight,
  touch, and speech on his disciple present.
* Those Gurus in position of householder, if they claim
  themselves to be a Sant, it is but deception on you. He
  cannot be a Sant. A true Sant will not indulge in fleeting
  pleasure even forgetfully. Those who are indulging in
  sensual pleasure are stuck in Maya. It only means he has
  not attained a true Athmic bliss. One who is merged in
  Parampurush assumes his form. For him all are his
  children. That is why father does not marry his daughter
  and he does not indulge in sensual pleasure.
