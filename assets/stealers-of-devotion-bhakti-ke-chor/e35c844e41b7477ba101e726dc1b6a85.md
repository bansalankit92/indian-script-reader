Sahib said---those who worship Lord Shiva, receive many

kinds of miraculous powers, wealth etc. Those with faith

find their place at Kailash Mountain. But later on, Kal throws

them again into this mortal world. Likewise, the worshipper

of Vishnu goes to Vishnu's abode, and that of Brahma to

Brahm Lok, but they don't remain there in a fearless manner.

They have to return again to this mortal world due to the

treacherous acts of Kal. Also, some remain absorbed in the

thoughts of sins and noble deeds and being ignorant of True

Devotion-Sathya Bhakti have to return to the mortal world.

After explaining the Sagun Bhakti, Sahibji tells

Dharamdasa about Nirgun Bhakti.

Sahibji says that many devotees came to this world.

They performed worship but without the real technique. There

is a definite way for everything. Maha Yogeshwar Shivji

etc. know the worship where a devotee has to recite the R-

Rankar Naam. The creation of the universe takes place from

this R-Rankar. But this worship (Bhakti) was concealed. None

but Shivji knows it. But the mode of worhip I am talking

about is different from this one. What to talk of the common

man, even Yogeshwar doesn't know it.

O Dharam Dass! You want to know the real mode of

worship. For this you must first of all understand that dance,

song, sounding of bell, idol worship etc. don't fall in the

category of Bhakti. Sahibji is not pleased with these. All

this is the network of Kalpurush. This is because it is Munn

itself that weeps sings, wakes and sleeps. So, as long as there

is lack of devotion in the interior, these outward things can't

make our consciousness active (Chetan). There can be no

worship without Sathya Naam. Unless one knows the abode

of true Sahib, there is no sense in feeling pleasure at heart.

One can find many devotees who are ignorant about the mode

of true worship. The whole of the world is entangled in the

outward things. In such a sutuation how can one hope to

cross the ocean of births and deaths?

O Dharam Dass! You are wise. So you should seek the

company of sants and perform true devotion-Sathya Bhakti.

There is one Purush Agam. The world doesn't know Him.

It is His worship alone that enables Jiva to escape from the

ocean of births and deaths. This is the hidden secret of Sathya

Bhakti which is altogether different from other modes of

worship prevalent in the world. Dharam Dass ji asked---

*Dharam Dass Kahey Suno Gusayin.*

*PooranPurush Basey Kihi Thayi.*

> *Kehi* *Vidhi* *Soun* *Sewa* *Kijey.*

*Kaisey Charan Kamal Chit Deejey.*

> **14** **Sahib Bandgi**

Dharam Dass ji asked as to where Param Purush lived

and how could one worship Him.

Sahib ji said---

*Pahiley Prem Angg Mein Aavey.*

*Sadhu Dekh Sammukh Hoye Dhavey.*

*Charan Dhoye Charan Amrit Levey.*

> *Preeti* *Sahit* *Sadhu* *Ko* *Sevey.*
>
> *Joyi* *Sadhu* *Prem* *Gati* *Janey.*
>
> *Ta* *Sadhu* *Ki* *Sewa* *Thaney.*

*Param Purush Ki Bhakti Drudhavey.*

*Surtey Nrup Ker Tahan Pahunchavey.*

*Ta Saun Bhakti Karo Chitlayi.*

*Chhodo Durmati Aur Chaturayi.*

*Tabb Hi Param Purush Ko Paye.*

*Bhav Ter Ke Jagg Bahuri Na Aavey*.

At first, one should kindle in oneself the light of love

for the Sadhu. Then he should wash his feet and take charan

Amrit and serve him. He should serve the Sadhu who knows

what true love is. It is he alone who will show the path of

true worship of Param Purush and will finally take him across

the ocean of births and deaths.

O Sahib! Common worldly people perform Sagun Bhakti.

Those upto the category of Yogeshwar perform Nirgun Bhakti.

But you are talking about the Bhakti that is far beyond these.

I fail to understand as to how can I concentrate at that point

and perform Bhakti. Kindly tell me the difference between

Sagun and Nirgun kind of Bhakti and the mode of third kind

of Bhakti. I know that you are truth and all your sayings as

well are true.

Sahibji said---

*Tahan Te Puni Ye Deh Girayi.*

Param Purush is the rarest of all. None knows Him.

What to talk of Sidhs and devotees, even Yogeshwar can't

have any knowledge of him. None of the devotees and

> **16** **Sahib Bandgi**

worshippers has been able to unfold the mystery of Param

Purush and as such has not been able to free himself of the

cycle of births and deaths.

Dharam Dass ji asked---

*Abb Moko Kachhu Sanshya Nahin.*

Dharam Dass ji wants to know whether a Sagun devotee

can also get salvation. Is that Sagun of some what different

kind of the same Param Purush. Kindly let me know the

difference between Sagun and Nirgun. How this universe

has been created? What is Brahm and what is Maya? Explain

to me the whole riddle of Bhakti (Devotion-worship) because

I know that you have appeared in this universe for helping

Jiva attain salvation.

Kabirji says that if that power is called as purush, it is

not purush in reality. This is because purush himself is the

creation of nature. If it is called as Shabad, it is not Shabad

in the real sense. This is because Shabad is also the creation

of Maya. Shabad is produced only when two things strike.

There can be no sound without the presence of two. So,

where there is the presence of two things, there is the presence

of Maya. But that Amrit Sagar is limitless. That is the Akshya

Lok with no particular Name. It never gets destroyed. But

if some Name is given to it, it will pertain to kal due to its

being within the limit of Akshyar (word). That real Purush

is without any Name. No particular word can be used for

Him. None knows Him. O Dharam Dass! That is my abode.

Even Kal can't reach there. Those who worship Him never

take rebirth again.

Sahibji says---

> *Utpati* *Pralaya* *Sirjan* *Hara.*

*Mera Bheid Niranjan Se Para.*

*Ta Se Jagat Na Kahu Mana.*

*Tatein To Hi Kahon Mein Gyana.*

*Jo Koyi Maane Kaha Hamara.*

> *So* *Hansa* *Nij* *Hoye* *Hamara.*

*Amar Karon Phir Maran Na Hoyi.*

*Taka Khoont Na Pakade Koyi.*

*Phir Ke Nahin Janmein Jag Mahin.*

> *Kal* *Akal* *Tahi* *Dukh* *Nahin.*

*Ankuri Jeev Ju Hoye Hamara.*

*Bhav Sagar Tein Hoye Neyara.*

Sahibji says---creation and pralaya (destruction) etc. is

the job of **Niranjan**. My identity is far away from that of

Niranjan. None knows it. One who accepts what I say,

becomes dear and near to me and I make him immortal. Such

a person crosses the ocean of births and deaths. Only some

enlightened Souls seek my shelter.

*Bhakti Bhakti Sabb Koyi Kahe, Bhakti Na Janey Bheid.*

*Kahain Kabir Pukari Ke, Bhakti Karo Jaji Bharam.*

**Every one talks of Bhakti, but in reality none knows**

**the secret of performing it. Man can know the art of**

**true & complete worship only when he seeks the shelter**

**of some real Satguru. So it is only by the grace of**

**Satguru that man will know the real path of worship.**

> **Stealer of Devotion** **23**

**2. Guru And Satguru**

Sahibji says---

in a rarional manner---

*Guru ke Nivajey So Phirat Hain Svachhand Tein.*

*Sunder Kahat Guru Kadhein Dukh Dwand Tein.*

A disciple should remain faithful to his Guru without

bothering for the results. But this is not for the Gurus indulged

in Sagun-Nirgun Bhakti. Then what does the Satguru give

to the disciple? A Satguru is the storehouse of the invisible

spiritual power. He can transfer that power in your interior

within a moment.

*Kotin Tirath Bhram Bhram Aawey.*

*So Phal Guru Ke Charnan Pawey.*

Such a high status has been accorded to a Guru.

Wherefrom did this power come? He whose Soul has become

united with that of Paramatma, has the power to bring the

desired change in you. Perhaps you think spiritualism means

to achieve what one desires. Certainly not. These are all

Siddhis (miraculous powers).

*Ashta Siddhi Nav Nidhi Ko, Sadhu Marat Laat.*

The Sants possess the greatest Siddhi. Do you know

what would happen when he transfers the spiritual power

in your interior?

*Keet Na Janay Bhring Ko, Guru Ker Ley Aap Saman.*

The Satguru will change you into his ownself.

Sahibji said that he disclosed the secret of immortal

Naam to the jivas but none could understand it. All were

busy reciting Ram Naam and remarked that the weaver was

ignorant and didn't know the secret of Paramatma. They

also said that he (Sahibji) was a low caste and had never

realised Paramatma. They knew Vedas and Puranas and had

learnt from them that Tridev alone were the greatest gods.

So they said that the weaver had forgotten all that and was

Sahibji asks Dharam Dass Ji to watch the wrong

approach of the worldly people. Jiva doesn't understand the

true Naam and shows its love for Kal. In Vedas as well one

can find the high status of Naam. In shastras one finds the

mention of Niranjan. None knows the secret of real Naam.

All get entangled in branches, leaves etc.

Everyone who gets entangled in these has to go to hell.

The ill-fated Jivas have begun to call the branches, leaves

etc. as Param Purush. Even study of Vedas has failed to unfold

the secret. The Bhakti of Tridev can never give salvation to

Jiva.

Sahibji says that the world has got entangled in Sagun

Bhakti. Sagun's creation takes place out of Nirgun. Satgun,

Rajgun and Tamgun combine to create Sagun. But Nirgun

is beyond that. Nirgun itself is Niranjan who creates and

swallows. Beyond that there is a unique Naam. That Sahib

Himself is the basis of all. The world doesn't know Him

because the messengers of Kal continue to mislead Jivas.

He who seeks the shelter of a true Satguru and concentrates

his attention on Naam, doesn't return to the ocean of births

and deaths. O Dharam Dass! The immortal Naam is hidden

and I have told it to you. He who seeks this Naam becomes

distinguished from the world. This world is like a mad person.

None knows the way to achieve Mukti.

Sahibji says to Dharam Dass that he has told all this

to him so that in the time to come, he may give the world

the message of true Sahib and true Naam.

This world is showing its love for falsehood. It has got

entangled in visiting holy places, observing fasts, taking holy

dips etc. People assume different forms, apply ashes and

go for begging from door to door. But they don't shun their

lust, anger etc. Thus all are themselves misled and continue

to mislead others as well. O Dharam Dass! This world is

two faced. It prefers to seek the shelter of Asurs (demons).

Without Naam, whole of the world is getting drowned in

the ocean of births and deaths.

Sahibji says---O Dharam Dass! Jiva can go to that Lok

only through the medium of Param Purush's true Naam. This

Aadi Naam (without any beginning) gives protection to Jiva

and takes him to Amarlok. That Lok of Sahibji is the rarest

of all. Param Purush holds his Durbar there. Darkness is

never to be seen there. Light and only dazzling light prevails

there. A Hansa remains there in perfect comfort. He who

goes there never returns to this mortal world. O Dharam

Dass! I have given you a brief description of Bhakti. So

nothing remains to be explained now.

> **Bin Janey Jo Guru Karayi, So Nahin Bhav Sagar So**\
> **Taryei.** A Guru has to love all. He hasn't to return love with\
> lust. To reutrn the true love of the devotees, he has to rise\
> above feelings of lust.
>
> **2nd,** the Guru must be Sargrahi (self dependent). He\
> who himself is dependent on others can't be expected to\
> do good to others. Guru Nanak Dev ji and other Sants like\
> Tuka Ram, Ravidas never did so. Sahib ji spent his life in a\

*Poorav Janam Ki Priti Se, Tohi Mila Hoon Aap.*

*Mukti Sandesh Sunawoon Ga, Le Chal Apne Saath.*

On hearing these words Neeru let Neema take the baby

along with them.

*Poorav Janam Ki Preet*

It was because of devotion and true love of the previous

birth that Neeru and Neema came in contact with Sahib ji.

Now the question arises as to what sort of a preet it was! It

is said that in dwapar there was a disciple of Sahibji, Supach

Sudarshan by Naame. Sahib ji came here in every yuga.

*Yugan Yugan Hamm Jahan Chaley Aaye,*

> *Jo* *Chihna* *Tahan* *Lok* *Pathaye.*

Sahib ji took Supach ji to Amarlok a number of times.

He requested Sahib ji to bless his parents also with Naam

and take them to Amarlok.

*Kahey Supuch Satgur Sun Lijey,*

> *Hamre* *Maat* *Pita* *Gati* *Dijey.*

*Bandi Chhor Karo Prabhu Jayi,*

*Jum Ke Des Bahu Dukh Payi.*

Sahib ji tried to persuade them for getting themselves

blessed with Naam but they didn't agree.

*Mein Bahut Bhanti Pita Samujhava,*

> *Maat* *Pita* *Partit* *Na* *Aava.*

However, Sahib ji said that he would definitely take

them to Amarlok. They died and were reborn in a Brahmin

family.

*Puni VIdhi Miley Tinhi Kahan Dina.*

*Kulpati Naam Vipra Ker Kahiya,*

> *Nari* *Naam* *Mahesri* *Rahiya.*

> **46** **Sahib Bandgi**

They had no issue. So she was praying the Sun for a son.

In the meantime Sahib ji fell into her lap.

*Bahu Adheen Putra Hitt Nari,*

*Kari Asnan Suraj Vratt Dhari.*

> *Anchal* *Le* *VInve* *Karr* *Jori,*

*Rudan Karey Chitt Sutt Kahan Douri.*

*Tatchhan Hum Anchal Per Aava,*

*Hamm Kahan Dekh Nar Harshava.*

She was very much pleased to see the child. She thought

that she had been blessed with a child by the grace of the

god sun. She brought the child home. Sahib ji again tried

to persuade them to go to Amarlok but they didn't agree.

As they didn't show faith in Sahib ji, who was in the guise

of a child, the latter disappeared.

*Tinn Hirdey Nahin Sabad Samaya,*

> *Balak* *Jani* *Partit* *Na* *Aaya.*

*Tahi Deh Chinhasi Nahin Monhi,*

*Bhayo Gupt Tahan Tann Taji Ohi.*

In the next birth they were born in a Mahajan family

with Uda and Chandan as Naames. At this time Sahib ji

appeared as a baby in a pond near their house. He remained

there for a day. When in the morning Uda came to the pond

to have a bath, she found the beautiful baby and brought it

home.

When Uda reached home along with the baby, Chandan

asked her wherefrom she had brought it?

*Chanden Sahu Us Kaha Sunayi.*

*Kahu Pyari Balak Kahan Payi,*

At this, Uda told him that she found the baby in the

sarovar and brought it home.

> *Kah* *Uda* *Jal* *Mahin* *Pava.*

*Sunder Dekhi Morey Mann Bhava.*

Chanden rebuked her and asked her to leave it wherefrom

she brought it, as the people will make a fun of them on

seeing this baby.

*Kah Chanden Te Murakh Nari,*

> *Begi* *Jahu* *De* *Balak* *Dari.*

*Jati Kutum Hansi Hain Sabb Loga,*

*Hansat Log Uthi Hai Tann Soga.*

As Uda went to leave Sahib ji, he disappeared from

her hands. Then both of them began to repent and weep.

They searched for Sahib ji in the forest but in vain.

*Yehi Vidhi Bahut Divas Chali Gayau,*

*Taji Tann Janam Bahuri Tinn Payau.*

They were born again and again as human beings because

of their coming in contact with Sahib ji. In the 4th birth

> **48** **Sahib Bandgi**

they were born as Neeru-Neema. That is why Sahib ji has said

that he came to them because of his love for them.

*Mera Naam Kabir Hai*

Reaching home, Neeru began to explain to all as to

how they found the baby. But none believed them. The people

began to make a fun of them.

The people asked them to give a Naame to the baby.

Now both Pandits and Quazis had to be invited as Sahib ji

was neither a Hindu nor a Muslim. None could know about

the true identity of Sahib ji.

At first, pandits were called. They began to think about

the proper Naame to be given to the baby. In the meantime

Sahib ji himself said---**Pandit ji! there is no need to give**

**any Name to me. My Name is Kabir.**

*Pandit Karan Jo Lagey Vichara,*

*Tabb Shishu Nij Mukh Bachan Uchara.*

> *Naam* *Kabir* *Hamara* *Ahei,*

*Aur Naam Jani Pandit Kahei.*

All were astonished to hear this. Some described him

as a highly enlightened Soul while others described him as

an incarnation of God.

*Yeh Sunkey Sabb Chakrit Bhaiu,*

*Shishu Niju Naam Aapte Kaheou.*

> *Koyi* *Kahai* *Dano* *Deva,*

*Koyi Kahai Yeh Alakh Abheva.*

> *Koyi* *Ishwar* *Ansh* *Batawa,*

*Koyi Kahai Aap Deh Dhari Aava.*

Sant Garib Dass ji has beautifully remarked at this---

*Kasi Umgi Gul Bheya,Momin Ka Ghar Gher.*

*Koyi Kahe Brahma Vishnu Hai,Koyi Kahey Indra Kuber.*

*Koyi Kahe Varun Dharam Rai Hai,Koyi Koyi Kah Iss.*

> *Solah* *Kala* *Suman* *Gati,Koyi* *Kahey* *Jagdis.*
>
> **Stealer of Devotion** **49**

*Mera Sharir Nahin Hai*

Now it was the turn of the Qazi to give a suitable Name

to the baby. When the Qazi opened the Quran to select the

suitable Name, he found nothing but Kabir, Akbar, Kabra,

Kibriya written on every page. These are the Names of God.

None of these Na bvnmes could be selected for the baby as

that could prove a cause of danger for the religion. Garib

Dass ji has nicely described this situation---

*Sakal Quran kabir Hai, Haraf Likhey Jo Lekh.*

*Kasi Ke Qazi Kahein, Neyi Deen Ki Tek.*

This situation caused so much confusion and

embarrassment to the quazis that they were forced to declare

that the baby was a Kafir. They asked Neeru to take him

inside and kill. Neeru took Sahib ji inside and began to kill

him with a dagger. This had no effect on Sahib ji. Then Sahib

ji said that he had no material body. Neither he ever died

nor did he take birth.

*Na Mere Asthi Rakta Nahin Chama,*

> *Hamm* *Hain* *Shabad* *Parkashi.*
>
> *Deh* *Apar* *Par* *Purushotam,*
>
> *Kahi* *Kabir* *Avinashi.*

Hearing this Neeru ran out in fear. At last, the Name

kabir had to be selected for the baby.

*Kakka Kewal Naam Hai, Babba Varan Sharir.*

*Rarra Sabb Mein Rami Raha, Jiska Naam Kabir.*

The very word kabir means one without a body. Garib

Dass ji has sweetly remarked---

> *Anant* *Koti* *Brahmand* *Mein,*
>
> *Bandi* *Chhod* *Kahaye.*
>
> *So* *To* *Purush* *Kabir* *Hai,*
>
> *Janani* *Jana* *Na* *Maye.*

*Sahib Purush Kabir Ne, Deh Dhare Na Koy.*

*Shabad Swarupi Roop Hai, Ghat Ghat Bole Soye.*

> **50** **Sahib Bandgi**

Sahib Ji didn't take any eatables.

*Pani Te Paida Nahin, Shwasa Nahin Sharir.*

*Anna Ahar Karta Nahin, Ta Ka Naam Kabir.*

***---Nabha Dass Ji***

In his childhood, Sahib ji didn't take any eatables. But

still his body grew. Neeru was sad to see all this. He requested

Sahib ji to have some food. Then Sahib ji told him to bring

an unmarried female calf as he would take only the milk of

such a female calf.

*Tattchhan So Jolha Chali Jayi,*

> *Gaou* *Bachhiya* *Kori* *Lyayi.*
>
> *Kora* *Bhanda* *Ek* *Gahayi,*

*Bhanda Bachhiya Shighra Hi Aayi.*

> *Dou* *Kabir* *Ke* *Samukh* *Aana,*

*Bachhia Heth So Bhanda Dharou,*

*Ta Ke Thann Hi Dudh Te Bhareou.*

> *Dudh* *Hamare* *Aage* *Dharhi,*

*Yehi Vidhi Khanpaan Nitt Karhi.*

As Sahib ji Looked at the female calf, milk began to

flow down her nipples. Soon the pot placed below was filled

up. In this way Sahib ji began to take food.

*Kiski Sunnat karna Chahte Ho*

At some suitable time the weavers asked Neeru to make

the child undergo the Sunnat ceremony. When the barbar

went inside for this ceremony, Sahib ji showed him five

penises and asked which one he wanted to choose for the

Sunnat ceremony. The barber ran out in fear.

> *Tabb* *Nai* *Kabir* *Dhig* *Aaya,*
>
> *Le* *Ustra* *Nikat* *Niyraya.*

*Paanch Indri Ta Ko Dikhlavo,*

*Kati Lehu Jo Tohi Mann Bhavo.*

> **Stealer of Devotion** **51**

*Yeh Lakhi Bhabhri Ke Nayi Bhaga,*

*Sunnat Nahin Keen Darr Laga.*

Then all the qazis and pandits came to Neeru and asked

him to let the child undergo the Sunnat ceremony. But the

barbar had run away. In the meantime, Sahib ji said to the

group of Qazis and pandits---

*Jo Tum Baman Bamni Jaya, Aan Baat Kahey Na Aaya.*

*Jo Tum Turk Turkni Jaya, Pait Mein Sunnat Kyun Na Karaya.*

If you consider yourself superior, you should have taken

birth from some other outlet.

*Ek Hi Rah Se Sabb Jug Aaya,*

*Ek Hi Mein Puni Sabey Samaya.*

> *Baigar* *Baigar* *Naam* *Dharaya,*
>
> *Ek* *Mati* *Ke* *Bhandey*.

Likewise if Sunnat is a precondition for becoming a

Muslim, God should have performed the same in the womb

itself. They felt small on listening to the wise thoughts of

Sahib ji. But pride prevented them from keeping silent. They

asked Neeru to tie him up and forcibly perform Sunnat. Sahib

ji was tied and people began to make a search for the barbar.

Sahib ji again said to the qazis and pandits---

> *Qazi* *Kaun* *Kitab* *Bakhana.*

*Jhankhat Bakat Raho Nisi Basar, Mati Eko Nahin Jana.*

> *Jore* *Julam* *Tum* *Sunnat* *Karat* *Ho,*

> **Seeking the shelter of Guru Ramanand**\

>
> In the morning, Sahib ji like a Vaishnav began to chant\

> Sikandar Lodhi.

*Qazi Pandit Mili Ke, Kaha Shah Se Jaye.*

*Hai Kabir Darvesh Yakh, Ta Ko Lehu Bulaye.*

> Sikandar sent for Sahib ji. The very sight of Sahib ji\
> cured Sikandar Lodhi of his trouble. He became very thankful\

> Takki became envious of Sahib ji.

>
> *Yeh* *Jolha* *Jaun* *Mara* *Jayi,*

Now these Pakhandis said to Takki "Sahib ji is a big

Kafir. He spares none. He terms our acts of Naamaz, sacrifice

etc. as pakhands. All the people of Kashi shower praises

on him. None shows any respect to us."

What a problem for the pakhandis! After all, what is

the basis of all this opposition? Remember! History repeats

itself. Takki consoled them and promised that he would soon

see to it that kabir ji is killed.

> *Kahe* *Takki* *Sun* *Pandit* *Qazi,*

So a conspiracy was hatched. The same conspiracy was

hatched to burn me alive at Akhnoor. Twice I was given the

poison. The pakhandis in connivance with politicians hatched

conspiracies. The kings have never thought of torturing the

spiritual leaders. But the pakhandis have always forced them

to do so. So the pakhandis were delighted as Sahib ji's

presence was proving a hindrance in the path of their deceitful

activities in the Name of religion. Sahib ji's truthful preachings

had created an awareness among the masses and they were

no longer prepared to fall in the trap of pakhandis. These

> **Stealer of Devotion** **55**

pakhandis said-

*Kashi Ke Log Hamen Nahin Maney.*

*Jolha Ki Sabb Sifat Bakhaney.*

> They were pleased to find Takki against Sahib ji. Takki\
> straightway went to the king and told him that Sahib ji was\

*Hai Kabir Pas hamarey Kahi Dilavo Aanch*

When kabir ji didn't get drowned in the river Ganges,

Takki said to him---If you escape alive from the burning

fire, I shall take you as ultimate realilty.

*Abhi Tohi Keema Kare, Deg Moond Dev Aanch.*

*Deg Aanch Se Banchiyo, To Kabir Tum Saanch.*

Sahib ji was put in a big Deg (a cooking vessel) and

its mouth was closed. The deg was put on logs of wood

and fire was lit. Sheikh Takki sat at some distance to see

the outcome. In the meantime, Sahib ji performed a miracle

and escaped from the burning Deg and sat by king Sikander.

On seeing Sahib ji, Sikander offered salutations and sent a

message to Takki That Sahib ji was sitting by him and who

was the fellow whom he was burning in the Deg.

Shar *Sikandar Peer Pe, Khabri Pathayi Saanch.*

*Hai Kabir Pass Hamare, Kahi Dilavo Aanch.*

Takki couldn't believe it. He lifted the cover of Deg

and found that it was empty. Takki was sad and depressed.

He came to the king Sikandar and on seeing Sahib ji he

remarked that he (Kabir Ji) knew some magic.

> *Aatur* *Takki* *Shah* *Pe* *Aaye,*

*Hamen Dekhi Puni Shish Dolaye.*

*Bahuri Takki lajjit Haiv Kahei,*

*Jolha pe Kachhu Chetak Ahei.*

Then he said that he would burn him (Sahib ji) in fire

and if he escaped death he (Takki) would take him (Sahib

ji) as truthful.

*Deg Aanch Jal Bancheou, Nahin Vyapey Tann Peer.*

> **58** **Sahib Bandgi**

*Bahuri Agin Jari Bachi Ho, To Tum Saanch Kabir.*

*Dinho Agni Lagaye*

When Sahib ji escaped from the hot Deg, Sheikh Takki

got a heap of logs prepared. He tied up Sahib ji, threw him

in its middle and set the logs on fire. But the fire got

extinguished. Takki tried his best but failed to burn it again.

*Tahi Beech Mohin Moond Ke, Dinho Agin Lagaye.*

*Agin Dhaye Bujhani, Jann Kabir Gun Gaye.*

*Again Takki didn't believe all that happened. He remarked*

*that Sahib ji had controlled the fire with his power of magic.*

*He said that he would put him alive under the ground. And*

*if he escaped alive, he (Takki) would consider him as a true*

*faqueer.*

Sheikh Takki got a well dug, tied up Sahib ji and threw

him into it. He got the well filled up with stones, bricks,

sand etc. He closed the mouth of the well and prayed to

God for the death of Sahib ji.

*Eint Pathar Te Bharey, Dinon Koop Moondaye.*

*Kahey Takki Abbki Marrey, Aiso Karrey Khudaye.*

Sahib ji again escaped fron that place and appeared

before king Sikandar. The king again sent a message to Takki

that Sahib ji was sittiing by him and who was the fellow

whom he had buried alive in the well.

**Jothi and Dhuns-Light and Sounds**

A man came to me for discussion. He said that the Dhuns

(Sounds) are the only reality. I said, no, it is not like that.

He began to cite from the sayings of Sahib ji---

*Rus Gagan Gufa Mein Ajhar Jharey.*

> *Bin* *Baja* *Jhankar* *Uthey* *Jahan,*

*Samujhi Parey Jabb Dhayan Dharey.*

I said that Sahib ji has not denied the existence of Dhuns.

But he has never taken these as Param Purush. **These Dhuns**

**provide us joy as well as light. But Sahib ji has talked of**

**something beyond**. So those who call these Dhunas as Param

Purush and cite from the sayings of Sahib ji to endorse their

view point are also like others thieves who are using these

sayings for their own convenience (Ignorently or otherwise).

*Jaap Mare Ajapa Mare, Anhad Bhi Marr Jaye.*

*Surti Samani Shabad Mein, Vako Kal Na Khaye.*

Sahib ji is pointing out to some other thing.

> *So* *To* *Shabad* *Videh.*

*Jibhya Parr Aawey Nahin, Nirkhi Parkhi Kar Leh.*

At some other place he has said---

> *So Satguru Mohi Bhavey,* *Jo Nainan Alakh Lakhavey.*

*Dolat Digey Na Bolat Bisrey, Jabb Updesh Drudhavey*

*Pran Pujya Kriya se nyara,Sahaj Samadhi sikhavey.*

> *Dwar* *Na* *Roondhey* *Pawan* *Na* *Rokey,*
>
> *Nahin* *Anhad* *Arujhavey.*

**Nahin Anhad Arujhavey.** Sahib ji clearly says that such

a Satguru is dear one as doesn't keep the devotees entangled

in Dhuns. And those who preach contrary to it, taking support

from the sayings of Sahib ji, are undoubtedly big thieves.

A sound is produced only when two things strike. There

are many kinds of words. Brahmanand ji also says---

*Anhad Ki Dhun Pyari Santo,*

> *Anhad* *Ki* *Dhun* *Pyari.*
>
> **Stealer of Devotion** **69**
>
> *Pahley* *Pahley* *Rilmil* *Bajey,*

> No other thing in this Brahmand can produce such a loud\
> explosion. It produces perspiration. Just as churning of curd\
> produces butter at the surface, likewise these sounds will\
> pull your interior upward. You will feel as if the Dhuns\
> (sounds) were making your identity perish away. Sometimes\
> some persons come and say that Sahib ji has said---

*Rass Gagan Gufa Mein Ajar Jharey.*

*Bin Baja Jhankar Uthey Jahan,*

> *Samujhi Parey Jabb Dhyan Dharey.*\
> Paltu Sahib also says---

*Ulta Kunwa Gagan Mein, Tismein Jarey Chirag.*

*Tis Mein Jarey Chirag, Bin Rogan Bin Baati.*

*Chaa Rutu Barah Mass,Rahat Jarate Din Raanti*

*Satguru Mila Jo Hoye, Tahi Ki Najar Mein Aawe.*

*Bin Satguru Kou Hoye, Nahin Vako Darsavey.*

*Nikse Ek Aawaj, Chirag Ki Jotehin Mahin.*

*Gyan Samadhi Suney, Aur Kou Sunta Nahin.*

Sahib ji is telling about the importance of the blessings

of a Satguru to enable one realise that truth. All lay stress

on the fact that more a person meditates, the more he rises

up and more powers he attains. The more noble and virtuous

deeds he performs, the more bebefits he will derive. All of

them are talking about achieving salvation on the basis of

one's own power. But Sahib ji has said some strange thing

in this regard---

*Bahu Bandhan Te Bandhiya, Ek Bechara Jeev.*

*Ki Chhutey Bal Aapne, Jo Na Chhudavey Peev*.

The court considers neither the newspaper nor the video

recording as a true and believeable piece of direct evidence.

This is because there is every possibility of distorting the

facts by making changes. Likewise, the selfish pakhandis

have made their desired changes in the original sayings of

Sahib ji to suit their selfish interests. Even my sermons can

be misrepresented and misquoted. It has really become a

matter of concern for the seekers after truth and for the holy

Sants to see all this distortion of facts regarding the sayings

of Sahib ji.

Even Sahib ji has talked about the 10th dwara. In this

regard he has said---

> *Sadhu* *Soyi* *Jo* *Yeh* *Ghat* *Linha,*
>
> *Nau* *Darvajey* *Pargat* *Chinha.*
>
> **72** **Sahib Bandgi**
>
> *Dasven* *Jaye* *Khol* *Jin* *Linha,*
>
> *Tahan* *Kul* *Gotra* *Hamara* *Hai,*

*Kar Naino Deedar Mahal Mein Pyara Hai.*

> But he has also said something beyond it. He has talked\
> about the 11th dwara. It means he has not considered the\
> 10th dwara as the ultimate one.

*Nau Dwar Sansar Sabb, Dasvein Yogi Saadh.*

*Ekadash Khidki Bani, Janat Sant Sujan.*

> The holy Sants know the mystery of the 11th dwara.\
> Even those who succeed in opening the 10th dwara, can't\
> escape the grip of Kal Niranjan. Sahib ji has made a mention\
> of 11th dwara at many places. But the selfish theives with\
> Sahibji's sayings are busy establishing the 10th dwara as\
> the ultimate one. Sahib ji has clearly said in his sayings---

*Dasvein Dwar Te Nyara Dwara,*

*Ta Ka Bheid Kahun Mein Sara.*

> Soul can never reach Amarlok through the 10th dwara.\
> Some imitate Sahibji and talk about Amarlok and Sachh\
> Khand, but again they stop at the 10th dwara. It is the dwara\
> that decides our destination after death. A jiva reaches where\
> from his pranas escape. In this regard Sahib ji has said---

*Antt Samey Jabb Jiv Ka Aavey,*

*Yatha Karam Tabb Dehi Pawey.*

> After his death a jiva assumes the new body as per his\
> karmas.
>
> *Heth* *Dwar* *Se* *Pran* *Nikasha,*

*Narak Khani Mein Pavey Vasa.*

> At the time of death if the pranas leave through the\
> Mall Dwara (Anus), the jiva straightway goes to hell. The\
> coming out of stool at death confirms it. It happens because\
> of the fear of Yamdoots who arrive to take jiva. The dying\

>
> **Stealer of Devotion** **73**
>
> like a man who leaves suicide note before committing suicide.\
> Without knowledge you can't know where the deceased has\
> gone. You can know when you will die. look at the sun, for\

> only. If you find a blue colored fly hovering constantly around\

> pingla. Both of these remain active for Â¾th of an hour. But\
> if only one of them remains active continuously for 20 days\
> while the other one becomes inactive, it also indicates that\
> death can occur within six months. Likewise, you can also\

> policeman comes to your house, you become afraid.\
> Remember! Yamdoots come only when they have to take\

> these devdoots. Such smiles that appear on the face and eyes\

In this way the deceased person leaves behind his identity.

In Ramayana also we find---

The people gave a wrong interpretation to it and said---

During his fight with lord Rama, he addressed him as Ram.

Neither in Valmiki Ramayana nor in Ramcharit Manas,

there is any mention of Ravana addressing Lord Rama as

Mra Mra. When even a great sinner could utter the word

Rama, why could't Valmiki ji do so. The fact is that Balmiki

ji had started breathing in the reverse direction towards

Ashtam-Eight Chakkar. Regarding this, Sahib ji has said---

*Pawan Ko Palat Ker, Shunya Mein Ghar Kiya.*

*Dhar Aur Adhar Mein Bharpoor Dekha.*

*Kahein Kabir Guru Purey Ki Mehar Se,*

> *Trikuti* *Madhye* *Dedar* *Dekha.*

Darya Sahib ji has also said---

*Chadhi Geyi Chanp Chali Jayun Dhara,*

> *Jayun* *Makri* *Mukh* *Tara.*

*Mein Mili Jaye Paye Piya Pyara,*

> *Jyun* *Salila* *Jal* *Dhara.*

Even Soordas ji has explained this situation in a beautiful

manner.

*Murli Dhun Gaja, Soor Surti Sir Saaja.*

Fodi Aakash Alal Pachh Bhaja,Ulti Ke Aapu Samaja.

The people have no knowledge and information about

the inner world. They interpreted in their own way. Only a

Sant can understand the meanings inherent in the sayings

of other Sants. That is why Sahib ji has said---

*Tera Mera Manuwan, Kaise Ik Hoyi Re.*

*Mein Kahta Hun Aankhin Dekhi,*

> *Tu* *Kahta* *Kagat* *Ki* *Lekhi.*
>
> *Mein* *Kahta* *Surjhavan* *Haari,*
>
> *Tu* *Rakheyo* *Urjhayi* *Re\...\...*

Your Mind and that of mine can't be the same. I am

speaking of that I have experienced, whereas you say what

the holy books contain. Again, I am trying to resolve the

tune of Mind. They will begin the Satsang with the sayings of

Sahib ji and will recite from there as well. But just see what

Sahib ji has said in this regard---

> *Nachna* *Gana* *Taal* *Peetna,*

*Randiya Khel Yeh Bhakti Nahin.*

The people instead of understanding the true essence

of his teachings, gave birth to an unreal type of Bhakti.

*Bhakti Na Hoye Nachey Gaye.*

*Bhakti Na Hoye Ghant Bajaye.*

He also spoke deeply about Dheyan Sutar.

*Sakal Pasara Mait Ker, Munn Pawna Ker Ek.*

*Unchi Tano Surti Ko, Tahan Dekho Purush Alekh.*

Some are trying to fix their concentration on Aagya

chakkar, others are doing the same on Merudand. And

interesting thing is that all are making use of the sayings of

Sahib ji.

But Sahib ji asked the disciples to fix their concentration

at a point 1Â¼ hand above the head.

> *Ida* *Pingla* *Sushman* *Sum* *Karey,*
>
> *Ardh* *Ao* *Urdh* *Vich* *Dhyan* *Lawey.*

*Kahein Kabir So Sant Nirbhaye Huwa,*

*Janaam Aur Maran Ka Bharam Bhaney.*

In this way Sahib ji established the high status and

inportance of a Satguru. The pakhandis gave much importance

to paramatma and didn't highlight the high status of a Satguru

so that the devotees may remain pleased with them for having

been shown the path of God worship. But Sahib ji has clearly

said---

*Kabira Hari Ke Roothtey, Guru Ki Sharni Jaye.*

*Kahein Kabir Guru Roothtey, Hari Nehin Hoat Sahaye.*

*Guru Gunge Guru Bavrey, Guru Ke Rahiye Dass.*

*Jo Guru Bhejein Narak Mein, Na Rakhiye Swarg Ki Aas.*

This is because the Guru has given the invaluable 'Naam'

> **84** **Sahib Bandgi**
>
> and hence Sahib ji has atteched great importance to the\
> institution of a Guru. Since these thieves have given nothing,\
> they can't be expected to speak about the high status of a\

> I have a right on my devotees. If they make some mistake,\

>
> *Naam* *has* *a* *unique* *nature.*\
> *Brahma Vishnu Maheshwar Thakey*,
>
> *Tinhun* *Khoj* *Na* *Paya.*
>
> What a strange kind of Naam it is! Isn't it really a\
> startling one?

***Khar Akshyar Ni-Akshyar Para. Virla Sadhu Paya**.*

> **Khar** means **Sagun, Akshyar** means **Nirgun** and **Ni-**\
> **Akshyar** is the state of Mahashunya. So it is beyond these.\
> *Koyi Kahey Halka Koyi Kahey Bhari.*
>

Everyone is talking about Ram Ram. The thieves have

stolen one or other Ram. But none could understand Ram

Sahib ji talked about. Those preaching Sagun Bhakti say

that Sahib ji was the worshipper of Ram, the son of king

Dashrath. But he has said clearly---

*Dashrath Sut Tihun Lok Bakhana.*

*Ram Naam Ka Maram Hai Aana.*

At some place he has given clarification about his Ram.

*Ek Ram Dashrath Ghar Doley,*

*Ek Ram Ghat Ghat Mein Boley.*

> *Ek* *Ram* *Ka* *Sakal* *Pasara.*

*Ek Ram Tri Bhuvan Se Nyara.*

Clearly, he is not speaking about king Dashrath's son,

Ram. He is not talking even about the Nirakar Ram that is

present in every Ghat (body). He has clarified it furthur---

*Sakar Ram Dashrath Ghar Doley.*

*Nirakar Ghat Ghat Mein Boley.*

> *Bindu* *Ram* *Ka* *Sakal* *Pasara.*
>
> *Niralumb* *Sabhi* *Tein* *Neyara.*

He called even Semen as Ram. Life is emerging out of

it. So in a clear manner he talked about Ram that is altogether

different from that of Sakar and Nirakar.

The word Ram emerged in the very beginning of the

universe. All the rishis thought about the Naam they should

recite. Then all of them meditated in shunya and said that

they would recite the Naam that emerged in their interior.

> *Brahma* *Vishnu* *Sankadi,*

*Sabb Mili Kinhi Shunya Samadhi.*

*Kavan Naam Sumirein Kartara,*

> *Kavan* *Naam* *Dhyan* *Anusara.*

All of them meditated on Shunya. **'Tabey Niranjan Jatan**

> **86** **Sahib Bandgi**
>
> **Kiya, Gufa Se Kinha Aawaz.'** A word came out of
> Shunya\...\...**R**\
> **Ra.** Niranjan produced this word. Then Maya produced the\
> word **Ma. 'Ma Shabad Maya Sanchara.'** Both were combined.\

> Nirgun were combined. It was just like a nick Name by which\
> a child is called at home. In this small Name both Maya and\
> Niranjan have, made their presence felt. But the Sants have\
> said some thing different from it.

*Jibhya par Aawey Nahin, Nirkhi Parkh Ke Leh.*

> Thus the cheats have distorted the sayings of Sahib ji\
> and talked about Niranjan. These thieves and cheats neither\
> have any knowledge of Sahib ji who is away from the three\
> lokas nor they have any knowledge of the 11th dwara. Also,\
> none of them has any knowledge about the misconception\
> created by Kal Niranjan. They have not made any attempt\
> to give more importance to Satguru than paramatma.\
> Moreover, none of them are in possession of some true **Naam.**\
> This is because they are not the holy Sants but are thieves\
> who have stolen the sayings and ideas of Sants.
>
> **Note :** We recognise the diffference between a local\

> forget the difference. Kaya Naam is associated with Kal\
> Purush while videhi Naam is associated with Satya Purush.\
> It is the latter that separates the Soul from the body and\
> takes it to Amarlok. Kabir ji has said---

*Deh Naam To Sabb Jape, Naam Videh Hamar.*

> *Soyi* *Naam* *Hai* *Akshyar* *Basa,*
>
> *Kaya* *To* *Bahar* *Parkasa.*

One thing is clear from the sayings of Sahib ji. It is---

> Why can't man across the ocean of births and deaths\

*Uttar Dall Per Munn Jabb Jayi,*

It means man has no control over his nature.

Sahib ji furthur says---

With some definite purpose Sahib ji has said---

*Sahib Ke Durbar Mein, Karta Kewal Sant.*

*Karta Kewal Sant, Hukam Mein Unke Sahib.*

*Saat Deep Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Bada Na Koye.*

*Karta Karey Na Kari Sake, Guru Karey So Hoye.*

*Usko Kaal Kya Karey, Jo Aath Pahar Hushiyar.*

*Kahein Kabir Guru payiye, Munn Hi Ki Parteet.*

*Munn Chihne Birla Koyi.*

> Munn is safe in darkness. Four things are born out of\

> **Stealer of Devotion** **93**

> So darkness will undoubtedly give rise to these four things.\

*Chah Miti Chinta Miti, Manva Beparvah.*

*Wo Hi Shahan Shah Hai, Jisko Nahin Chah.*

> So the first form of Munn is---Sankalp (desire). It is\
> the desire that makes you sad or happy. The fulfilment of\
> desires gives us joy while their unfulfilment gives us sorrow.\
> Both these worldly sorrows and joys are like chains. The\

> activities are Ahankar. Doing such and such thing or will\
> do such a thing are Ahankar. There is no Ahankar (Ego-\

> controller of Brahmand even. The Soul has got entangled.
>
> Whenever you sit in meditation, the Munn creates\

> The woman is far ahead of man in the field of worship\

This much has been said about the mother. But every

role of a woman in different forms is praiseworhy. The role

of a daughter is also very lovable. Every one desires for a

son but son is like an enemy. Sahib ji has said in a clearcut

manner. Just think over it.

*Bajigar Ka Bandra, Aisa Jeev Munn Saath.*

*Nana Nach Nachaye Ke, Rakhey Apney Haath.*

> For all the 24 hours the Soul is dancing to the tune of\

That is why Sahib ji has repeatedly said---

*Tera Bairi Koyi Nehin, Tera Bairi Munn.*

> Arjun said to Vasudev that air can't be collected in a\
> bundle, but I shall try to do so if you so desire. If you ask\
> me to churn the sea, I shall make an attempt to do so. But I\
> won't like to make any attempt for controlling mind. I have\

> The network of Munn-Maya is not made of ropes. It is made

>
> of Kaam (lust) and Krodh (anger). With no power to judge,\
> man has got entangled in these. Even great Rishis and Munies\
> have failed to understand and control it.

Sahib ji has beautifully said in this regard---

*Kaam Prabal Ati Bhayankar, Maha Darun Kal.*

*Gun Gandharv Sur Ner Muni, Sabey Keen Behal.*

> With this Kaam Munn is making the three lokas dance\
> to its tune.

*Chashme Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashey Ho Rahe.*

*Dil Sataan Kya Kya Hain Terey, Dil Sataney Ke Liye.*

> Krodh (anger) is more dangerous than Kaam. Anger\
> turns a man wild and badly affects his reasoning power. It\
> fills the brain with cruelty and violence, mouth with foam\
> and robs a man of his thinking and reasoning power. Nothing\
> can be done unless these are brought under control. Brigu\
> Rishi worshipped for a long time but in the fit of anger kicked\
> Vishnu ji in the chest. Also, Durvasa Rishi in the fit of anger\
> killed 52 Koti yadavas.

> If this is the condition of such great rishis, what can\

The third one is Lobh (greed)

*Bura Lobh Te Aur Na Koyi.Kaami Ner Bahutey Tarrey,*

*Krodhi Tarrey Anant. Lobhi Banda Na Tarrey,*

> *Kahein* *Kabir* *Siddhant.*

> The network of this Lobh (Greed) is also very strong.\
> Even Narad ji came into its grip. It is because of it that man\
> commits cheating, robbery and performs other unjust acts.

> It has its sons and grandsons also. Lobh gives birth to\

> these dangerous vices.

*All these things are not going to pay.*

*Kitne Tapsi Tapp Ker Darey,Kaya Dari Gara.*

*Grah Chhod Bhaye Sanyasi,Taou Na Pawat Para.*

None can escape the network of Kal by his own power.

*Naam Bina Pawey Nahin, Kotin Karey Upaye.*

> The people thought perhaps it was a 52 lettered Naam.\
> One can call such Names as Kallu, Raju, Sanjay etc. but\

*Jabb Mein Tha To Guru Nahin,*

> *Abb* *Guru* *Hain* *Mein* *Nahin.*

>
> *Ja* *Mein* *Do* *Na* *Samahin.*

*Munn Jata Hai Jaan Dey, Gah Ke Rakh Sharir.*

*Utra Pada Kaman Se, Kya Kar Sakta Teer.*

> Let the Munn go if it so desires, but don't let the body\
> go. It will become ineffective. It works with the help of body\

> may be lazy, but it is alert. Whenever something goes wrong,\
> some invisible force will at once appear to make you alert.
>
> **120** **Sahib Bandgi**

Then the inner eye gets opened and you remain alert.

*Tako Kal Kya Karey, Jo Aath Pahar Hushiar*.

> If a vehicle develops some fault, you go to a mechanic\
> who knows how to rectify the fault. Likewise, a Satguru is\

All are talking about Shabad-Shabad (Naam), but none has

been able to recognise the Shabad. Sahib ji says that at first

the Paramatma (Niranjan) uttered five words---

*Prathmai Pooran Purush Puratan,*

> *Paanch* *Shabad* *Uchara.*
>
> *Soham* *Satt* *Jyoti* *Niranjan,*
>
> *Rarankar* *Aunkara.*

That is to say none of these Shabads represents

Paramatma. Paramatma is He who has uttered these words.

*Shabdai Nirgun Shabdai Sargun,*

> *Shabadai* *Ved* *Bakhana.*

*Shabdai Puni Kaya Ke Bheetar,*

> *Kari* *Baithey* *Asthana.*
>
> *Gyani* *Yogi* *Pandit* *Sabhin,*
>
> *Shabadai* *Main* *Arujhana.*

*Paanch Shabad Aur Paanchon Mudra,*

> *Kaya* *Paanch* *Thikana.*

It is the Shabad that is Sagun or Nirgun. In vedas also

there is a mention of Shabad. That Shabad is present in this

body as well. Sahib ji says that great Yogis, learned men,

pandits etc. are all entangled in these shabads. These five

shabads are present at five places in the body. Devotees move

to them through five postures (Mudras). After all, how do

they do so. Sahib ji has said---

*Shabad Niranjan Chachri Mudra,*

> *So* *Hai* *Nainan* *Mahin.*
>
> *Tehi* *Ko* *Jana* *Gorakh* *Yogi,*
>
> *Maha* *Tej* *Hai* *Tahin.*

Earlier Gorakh Nath ji was reciting the Naam 'Jyoti

Niranjan'. He concentrated his attention at the place midway

between the eyes. Many People in our country are still doing

the same. But Sahib ji has not asked the devotees to

> **Stealer of Devotion** **131**
>
> concentrate the attention here. Those who do so say that such\
> a practice takes us to Alakh Niranjan. They stop at this point\
> and can't move furthur. The devotees also achieve some Siddhis\
> (miraculous powers). But this is not the abode of Soul. Sahib\
> ji says---\
> *Shabad Aunkar Bhuchri Mudra,Trikuti Hai Asthana.*

*Vyasdev Ta Ko Pahichana,Chand Surya So Jana.*

> Veyas ji concentrated at Aagya Chakar with the recitation\
> of 'Aum'. This posture (Mudra) helps a devotee to achieve\
> ethereal body (Mahakaran Dehi). He reaches the\
> Pragyavastha, a state which enables him to see many lokas\

> *Shukdev Ta Ko Pahichana, Sun Anhad Ki Tana*.
>

*Rass Gagan Gufa Mein Ajar Jharai.*

*Bin Baja Jhankar Uthey Jahan,*

*Samujhi Parai Jabb Dhyan Dharai.*

> The tunes arising out of Bhanwar Gufa reach the\

*Anhad Nad Gagan Chad Garja,*

> *Tabb* *Rus* *Bhaya* *Amida.*

*Sushman Shunya Surat Mahlon Nabh,*

> *Aaya* *Ajar* *Akida.*

Brahmanand ji has also said about these tunes---

> *Anhad* *Ki* *Dhun* *Pyari* *Sadho,*
>
> *Anhad* *Ki* *Dhun* *Pyari* *Re.*
>
> *Aasan* *Padam* *Laga* *Kar,*

*Kar Se Moond Kan Ki Bari Re.*

*Jheeni Dhun Mein Suratt Lagao,*

> *Hoat* *Nad* *Jhankari* *Re.*
>
> *Pahley* *Pahley* *Rilmil* *Bajey,*
>
> *Pichhey* *Nyari* *Nyari* *Re.*
>
> *Ghanta* *Shankh* *Bansri* *Bina,*

> *Taal* *Mrudang* *Nagari* *Re.*

*Din Din Sunat Naad Jabb Biksey,*

> *Kaya* *Kanpat* *Sharirey.*

*Amrit Boond Jharey Mukh Mahin,*

> *Yogi* *Jann* *Sukh* *Kari* *Re.*

*Tan ki sudh sab bhul jaat hai*

> *Ghat* *me* *hot* *ujari* *re*

So all have taked about the tunes being played inside.

Sahib ji and Sants have not denied the existence of these

tunes but have clearly said that these are not the ultimate

reality. Sahib ji says---

*Jaap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Marr jaye.*

*Surti Samani Shabad Mein, Usko Kal Na Khaye.*

Then which one Shabad it is! It means the Shabad that

is being mentioned is some other one. That is why at some

other place he has beautifully said---

> *Soyi* *Satguru* *Mohin* *Bhave,*
>
> *Jo* *Nainan* *Alakh* *Lakhawey.*
>
> **Stealer of Devotion** **133**
>
> *Dolat* *Digey* *Na* *Bolat* *Bisrey,*\
> *Jabb* *Updesh* *Drudhawey.*
>
> *Pran Poojye Kiriya Si Nyara,*\
> *Sahaj* *Samadhi* *Sikhawey.*
>
> *Dwar Na Roondhey Pawan Na Roke,*\
> *Nahin* *Anhad* *Arujhawey.*
>
> He has clearly mentioned that the Shabad should not\
> entangle in anhad tunes. It is a clear evidence of the fact\
> that Sahib ji has been making a mention of things beyond\
> these tunes.

*Trikuti Mahal Mein Aav Jahan Aunkar Hai.*

*Aage Marg Kathin So Agam Apar Hai.*

*Tahan Anhad Ki Ghor Hoat Jhankar Hai.*

*Lagi Rahey Sidh Sadhu Na Pawat Par Hain.*

> *Ta* *Ooper* *Akash* *Ami* *Ka* *Koop* *Hai.*

*Anant Bhanu Parkash So Nagar Anoop Hai.*

*Ta May Akshyar Ek So Sabka Mool Hai.*

*Kahon Sookshyam Gatti Hoye Vidhehi Phool Hai.*

*Ni Akshyar Ka Bheid Hans Koyi Payi Hain.*

*Kahe Kabir So Hansa Jaye Samayi Hain.*

*The Shabad Sahib ji talked about is Ni-Shabad.*

*Satt Shabad So Unmuni Mudra, Soyi Aakash Sanehi.*

*Ta Mey Jhilmil Joat Dikhavey, Jana Janak Videhi*.

> Raja Janak made use of unmuni Mudra. He concentrated\
> his attention at Sahsrasar Chakkar. Sahib ji says the destination\
> yet is some what away. He has said for the fifth Mudra\
> (Posture)---\
> *Rarankar Khechri Mudra, Daswan Dwar Thikana.*

*Brahma Vishnu Maheshwar Deva, Rarankar Ko Jana.*

> **All the Rishi Munies, Siddhas etc. of the Treta Yuga**\
> **stopped at this point. But Sahib ji talked about some thing**\
> **even beyond it. He has said a very startling thing**---
>
> **134** **Sahib Bandgi**

*Panch Shabad Ao Pancho Mudra,*

> *Soyi* *Nishay* *Mana.*
>
> *Aagey* *Puran* *Purush* *Puratan,*
>
> *Uski* *Khabar* *Na* *Jana.*
>
> *Sidh* *Sadhu* *Tridevadi* *Ley,*
>
> *Panch* *Shabad* *Mein* *Atkey.*

*Mudra Sadh Rahey Ghat Bheetar,*

> *Phir* *Oandhey* *Munh* *Latke.*

It means all of them stopped at this point. None went

furthur. Furthur he has said---

> *Iske* *Aage* *Bheid* *Hamara,*
>
> *Janey* *Ga* *Koyi* *Janan* *Hara.*
>
> *Kahein* *Kabir* *Janey* *Ga* *Soyi,*

*Ja Per Kripa Satguru Ki Hoyi.*

If you want to reach Delhi from Jammu, you have to

go via Pathankot. But Pathankot is not the goal, it is only a

stopover. It is foolish to oppose Yog. But if the person

performing Yog thinks he can reach Amarlok, it is nothing

but a foolish idea.

*Bin Satguru Pawey Nahin, Koyi Kotin Karey Upaye.*

Likewise, Sushumna is a medium, not the destination.

Some describe Sushumna as everything, but Nanak Dev Ji

has said---

> *Ida* *Pingla* *Sushumna* *Boojhey,*
>
> *Aape* *Alakh* *Lakhawey.*
>
> *Uske* *Ooper* *Sancha* *Satguru,*
>
> *Anhad* *Shabad* *Surti* *Samavey.*

All the Rishi Munies of Trikal talked of Nirakar and

of three Lokas, but Sahib ji talked of something even beyond

it. Gorakh Nath ji was performing Pawan Yog. Find something

inside, he thought that the search had been completed.

Certainly not! Sahib ji has not only talked of Sushumna and

> **Stealer of Devotion** **135**
>
> of other things but has also told the importance and limit of\
> each. Sahib ji has described Sushumna as the medium and not\
> the goal. That is why he said---
>
> *Ingla* *Vinshey* *Pingla* *Vinshey,*
>
> *Vinshey* *Sushuman* *Nadi.*
>
> *Jabb* *Unmuni* *Ki* *Tari* *Tootey,*

>
> Sahib ji gave such persons the knowledge of Ni-Shabad\

*Purush Kaho To Purushey Nahin,*

**TRUE MEDITATION**

*Sakal Pasara Mait Ker, Munn Pawna Ker Ek.*

*Oonchi Tano Surti Ko, Tahan Dekho Purush Alekh.*

There is need to divert our attention from every other

object. It is all the play of Surti (attention). But to get the

sushumna opened, there must be harmony between Irha and

Pingla.

*Chakmak Pathri Rahat Ek Sanga.*

> *Uthat* *Nahin* *Chingari.*

Chakmak Pathhers (stones) may be there but fire can

be produced only when there is some friction (struggle). The

gate to that universe is inside Sushmna and will open only

when there is harmony between Irha and Pingla. But we

have not to stop at Sushmna alone.

*Ingla Vinshey Pingla Vinshey, Vinshey Sushman Nadi.*

*Jabb Unmuni Ki Tari Toote,Tabb Kahan Rahi Tumhari.*

Irha, Pingla and Sushumna, all will perish when the

body perishes. Then where will the concentration be fixed.

Sahib ji has mentioned where to fix the concentration---

*Oonchi Tano Surti Ko, Tahan Dekho Purush Alekh.*

He has asked to fix Surti (attention) 1Â¼ Haath (hand)

above the head. But if you can't do so, there is nothing to

bother**. Dharam Dass ji asked Sahib ji as to how could**

**one achieve the param Tattav (ultimate reality). Sahib ji**

**cleared all the doubts in one word. He said that one should**

**fix one's Surti in one's Satguru. It is for the Satguru to**

**do the rest.**

> **138** **Sahib Bandgi**

Sahib ji encourages all to try fearlessly the Saar Shabad

(Naam) which alone can be helpful in taking Jiva across

the ocean of births and deaths.

*Smoojhi Na Parali Naam Ki Kahani*

> *Tiyo* *Kahe* *Rahey* *Utrani.*

Sahib ji says that even Hirnayakashyap, Ravan, Kans,

Krishan ji, gods, Munies and Brahma left this world without

knowing the secret of true Naam. None could understand

whether that **Naam** is the true one or an unreal or mixed

one.

*Naam Naam Sabb Jagat Bakhana.*

*Naam Bheid Koyi Birla Jana.*

The Soul escaped from the body before jiva could

traverse the path that led to the ultimate reality. Infact, these

three lokas are a sort of network to entangle the fish in human

form. Without boarding the boat of true Naam from a prefect

Satguru, there can be no chance of crossing this ocean of

births and deaths. But the people, instead, are boarding the

boat of unreal Naam from imperfect Gurus and are, as a

result, getting drowned. They think they are getting across,

but actually it is not so.

Sahib ji says that even Shesh Nag and Garurh got

perished. Cheat Shakni along with 100 Kauravs also got

perished. Those who committed sins or did noble jobs or

achieved the knowledge of Sagun-Nirgun, also got perished.

How much to say, even the Fire, Air and Water also get

perished. Even Vishnu lok gets perished. Sahib ji says that

he has seen all these getting perished away.

Sahib ji says to Pandits,''You are showing your

cleverness with bookish knowledge in hand. But tell me

something about the way you are going to attain salvation.

Say something about the country and the village where

paramatma resides. Brahmaji gave to the mankind the four

vedas but couldn't understand the secret of salvation. He

> **140** **Sahib Bandgi**

gave a detailed account of acts of charity and other noble deeds

but couldn't know of his own death. Even he couldn't escape

the grip of Kal and couldn't achieve salvation. Sahib ji says

that there is a special **Naam** where I stay and which alone can

give salvation.

The virtues of that true Naam (Sahib) are entirely different

from the three lokas. The virtues are of three kinds---Satgun

(Vishnu ji), Rajo Gun (Brahma ji) and Tamogun (Shiv ji).

Sahib ji says to the intellectual and seekers after truth to

understand this point which thougtless and foolish persons

are unable to understand. That Naam (Sahib) is beyond

Vishnu, the lord of three lokas. Many noble and holy Souls

like lord Ramchander and lord Krishan and other incarnations

> **Stealer of Devotion** **141**

like Vaman, matasya etc. came and went but none could know

of that Naam. Many Sidhs, Rishis, Munies and Sanyasis went

to the forests in search of Sahib ji but couldn't succeed in

their mission. Sahib ji says that when even Guru Gorakh Nath,

Brahma ji, Vishnu ji, Shiv ji, Sankadik and others coundn't

know of that Naam (Sahib ji), how can an ordinary man hope

to do so on his own.

Sahib ji says that the whole world has gone mad in

this universe of Munn-Maya. Munn Maya has made all human

beings spell bound. These have cheated all including Brahma

ji---the creator of the universe, Shesh Nag, Shiv ji, Vishnu

> **142** **Sahib Bandgi**

awake, but what is the use of getting awake after one meets

Sahib ji says that one should worship the Sant who is

untouched by Kal plans. Holy men like Dattatreya couldn't

know the secret of truth because they remained absorbed

in unreal Bhakti. They tried to obtain ghee by churning water.

Gorakh ji gained control over his breaths through Yoga

practices. He also obtained many miraculous powers but

couldn't realise the truth. Kal didn't spare even Vashishath

ji, an authority on knowledge and Guru of lord Ram. He

didn't spare even Ram (the son of king Dashrath) who was

worshipped as God. Hindus coffine their deads to flames while

unreal maya as true one. All the activities of the world are

being performed as per his dictates. At some place he created

six Aashrams while at the other place he brought forth six

darshans. None has succeeded in freeing himself from his

bondage.

Sahib ji says to the sanyasis that instead of wandering

within the limits of Munn, they should worship. Sahib who

is far beyond par Brahm and it is the only place where one

can achieve salvation. At that place there are no days and

nights, Mohammad, Vishnu, Hazrat, Man, God, incarnations,

Matsya, Kachh and the like. There is not even a shadow of

Ved, Kiteib, Samriti, Sanyam, life etc. There is no need for

anyone to go for Naamaz or call Allah aloud or perform

Kalma. There is neither Ram nor Allah and nor beginning,

end, Munn, Fire, Air, Water etc. Also, there are no Jivas

belonging to 84 lakh Yunis. Even Sakhis, Shabads and Vanies

are not to be found there. So Sahib ji asks the Sanyasis to

give a thought to the fact as to wherefrom did Niranjan appear

and who created this unreal and false universe. The fact to

keep in mind is that Sahib ji created Niranjan, the lord of

three lokas and the latter, acting as a bad son, created the

unreal and false universe.

Sahib ji says that one has to reap the fruits of one's

karmas.Even crores of Yugas can't write off the fruit of

Karmas. Just see, Guru Vashishath gave final shape to the

Lagan of marriage between Ram and Sita and the Sun gave

a mantar to Sita, but she never spent a comfortable life even

after her marriage with lord Ram. Lord Ram had to kill Bali

from a hiding place but in dwapar Yug Bali got an opportunity

to take revenge with lord Krishan, the incarnation of Lord

Ram.

Then Vishnu ji changed the face of Narad ji into that

of a monkey and cut off the head of Shishupal in his

incarnation as lord Krishan. But he himself had to reap the

fruit of all these Karmas. Sahib ji says that parvati shouldn't

be called as childless and lord Shiva shouldn't be called as

a beggar because these are very strange things regarding the

doer and the Karma.

Sahib ji says to Sants,''Don't believe that which is unreal

and false. A thug (Cheat) in the form of Munn resides in

you. But you should keep clinging cling to your spiritual

knowledge. All that you see in the earth and in sky is nothing

but manifestation of falsehood. In all the ten directions there

is the trap of Munn. Jiva has been entrapped in his net. Ved,

Kiteib, Yog, Jap, Tap, Sanyam, Tirath, Vratt, Daan Bhakti

etc. are all the various forms of falsehood. These are not

going to help Jiva attain salvation. He who gains an experience

of Anhad sounds, begins to consider himself as a great fellow

and he who gains some siddhis (super natural powers) begins

to boast of them. Both Hindus and Muslims are enganged

in earning Name and fame. People waste the precious

moments of their life in talking about the sky, but they forget

that the death is drawing near. With all their pride, they get

drowned in the ocean of births and deaths for want of real

and true knowledge.'' Sahib ji says whom should I tell that

which I have in my heart. The whole world has gone blind.

The people are running away from truth towards falsehood.

Sahib ji says,''There is some rare fellow whom we can

call as our friend and who remains engaged in Bhakti to

make his future bright. He remains satisfied in whatever

condition the Guru keeps him. Some ignorant are engaged

in doing pranayama and Aasans (Postures), while others are

engaged in the study of Vedas, Shastras, astrology etc. All

have got entangled in six darsans and 96 kinds of pakhands,

but none has been able to understood the real mode of

worship. Even great religious scholars who have toured the

world many a time, couldn't find peace. They are engaged

in the upliftment of the people but they have not succeeded

in controlling their mind. Sahib ji says that even Yogis and

Jangams and the like are holding false faiths. When the Jiva

gets absorbed in reciting the holy Naam recieved from a

true Satguru like a chatak that doesn't drink any other water

except that in Swati Nakshyatra, will cerrtaninly adopt true

Bhakti and become our friend.
