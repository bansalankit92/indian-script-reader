Kabir Sahib says that when the power of ParamPurush
enters, Kaal (formless mind) cannot do anything. The
day when you take Sajeevan Naam from a real Satguru,
the power of ParamPurush will be filled in you. Then,
Kaal cannot influence or force you.

#### My Goal

The world of Sants has been very unique. In order to
tell the facts of eternal truth (param satya) to the world;
the Sants have used the common man’s language. Sants
have also used ‘Ram’ or ‘Hari’ in different places in their
discourses. However by Ram they have meant ‘Sahibji’
(the Supreme Lord) and none else. Therefore do not get
confused. Kabir Sahib has clarified this fact by talking
about four different ‘Rams’.

_Sakar Ram Dashrath Ka Beta, Nirakar Ghat Ghat Mein Leta.
Bindu Ram Jin Jagat Pasara, Niralamb Ram Sahib Te Nyara._

The people in the world are saying that Sants are the
devotees of the same Ram who they are worshipping.
However Kabir Sahib has said that latter is Ram having
mortal body i.e. **Sakar** Ram. In other places Sants are
mistakenly considered the devotees of formless Ram
i.e. **Nirakar,** the second Ram. The third Ram is the Sperm
which has created the world around us. But the Sants
worship the fourth one who is free. He is not incarnated
through the process of birth and death. He is the one who
has been addressed as ‘Sahib’ by the Sants. Some of the
verses of Sants also have references to the formless
worship because before getting the holy Naam (Initiated)
from Kabir Sahib, they were the devotees of Formless
Ram (Niranjan) which itself is the fifth element of this
world. Again in some places Sants have talked about the
secrets of Yoga etc. in their discourses. They have also
talked about the internal sounds and about the 10th^
aperture of human body. Due to this, people feel that the
Sants have talked about the importance of yoga, which is
not true. Sants have said this in order to tell the limits of
yoga. Stating all this they have emphasized the importance


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 5
of the “Essence Word” i.e. Saar-shabd which does not
emanate from internal sounds. Hence it is also known as
“Soundless sound” or Nih-shabd. Thus one must not get
confused on finding the description of internal sounds or
internal game in their words. The only thing to be
understood here is that the Sants have described these
three worlds (lokas) as the perishable world of Kal Purush
(Niranjan). And they have also talked about the
indestructible world i.e. Amar-loka (the Supreme Lord’s
abode), which can be reached through our concentration
(Surati). Hence you don’t have to wander outside in search
of the Supreme Lord. The way to Him is opened only
when you get the holy Name (Saar- shabd) possessed by
the Sants alone.

I want to pass the pure knowledge of soul (Atma-
Gyaan) to you. Today nobody talks about Atma-Gyan. All
are lost. Some are wandering outside the body and some
inside it. None has any idea of Atma-gyaan.

#### What Can The Poor Creature Do?

_Bahu Bandhan Te Bandhiya, Ek Behaara Jeev,
Jeev Bechara Kya Kare, Jo Na Churahiyen Peev._
Our soul has much bondage. Such an intelligent man,
who is the supreme of all creations, whose body is also
called as ‘Narayani Chola’ (the body of Gods), is not able
to understand his bondages. He is neither able to see the
way in which he is tied nor is he able to see who has tied
him. He is also not able to find out the knot and the way in
which he can liberate himself. What is this mystery? What
is the secret?
_Atma Gyaan Bina Nar Bhatake, Kya Mathura Kya Kashi.
Kabir sahib has said that without the knowledge of soul men
uselessly wander in religious places like Mathura and Kashi_
Such an intelligent man is not able to know these secrets.
He is not able to understand the bondage.
There are indications in the scriptures that Lord lives
within us. He is an integral part of us. Despite this, man is
unable to understand these facts. What is the reason? How
powerful are these evil forces which are misleading the
soul? The soul is unable to understand them. Wise, learned
men of different religions like Peer, Paighambar, Qutub
and Auliya are unable to solve this mystery. Which
unknown powerful force has kept the soul in dark, due to
which the soul is not able to reach its destination i.e.
Amarlok or the Supreme Lord’s abode, even though it
wants to.
_Bin Rasari Sakal Jag Bandhya.
Kabir sahib has said that all the people in this world are
bound but without a visible rope_
Only human beings have the privilege of salvation
because they are the most intelligent of all creations. Such
an intelligent being is unable to see his bondages. Why?
Come, let us analyze. Even Goswamiji has pointed it out


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 7
in Ramayana. When Garudji (Celestial Vulture- Carrier of
Lord Vishnu) went to Kakbhusundiji (the holy crow) to
get Atma-gyaan (knowledge of soul) there ensued a
discussion between them.
_Suno Taat Yeh Akath Kahaani, Samjhat Bane Na Jaye
Bakhaani._
O beloved friend! I am telling you the untold story of
the knowledge of soul. Try to understand it. However I
cannot describe it fully because there are no words for
this. Hence your cooperation is required. Listen to me
very carefully. This is unexplained as words cannot
describe it. This is untold as there are no words for it.
Even then I will try and explain it. Whatever I am trying
to explain regarding the soul and its characteristics, cannot
be comprehended with the reasons.
_Eeshwar Ansh Jeev Avinaashi, Chetan, Amal, Sehaj, Sukhrasi._
This soul is a part of the Supreme Lord. It is Immortal
(Avinaashi), spiritually active (Chetan), pure and free of
vices (Amal). It is free from deceit and is spiritually
simple (Sehaj). Besides, it is full of joy, happiness and
bliss (Sukhrasi).
_So Maaya Bas Bhayo Gosain, Bandhyo Keet Market Ki Naayi._
Such a soul is tied like a parrot, like a monkey! For
capturing the parrot the bird-catcher prepares an
instrument called ‘nalika’ (made of a hollow bamboo
stick). This nalika is kept on a wheel and a mirror is fitted
under the wheel with a fruit attached to it. The parrot
comes to eat the fruit. But the moment parrot rests its feet
on the nalika it turns upside down due to the weight of the
parrot. Now the parrot can see itself in the mirror. When it
sees its reflection in the mirror, the parrot thinks that the
other parrot has caught it. In reality there was no other
parrot to catch it. The wheel was prepared in such a way
so as to turn upside as soon as some weight was kept on it.
In this way the parrot’s feet went up and its head went


8 Sahib Bandgi
down and it considered itself caught even though it was
free. In the meantime the hunter comes and puts the bird
in the cage.
Similarly our soul also considers itself to be tied, when
actually no one has tied it. In fact is that it is something
which can never be tied. There are three requirements for
tying.

- First - One who ties,
- Second - One who is tied and
- Third - The means.
  For example - we tie a cow or a horse. Here the animal
  has been tied, we have tied it and a rope has been used to
  tie it. This means that there will be three things to bind the
  soul too. First is the one who is bound – The soul. What a
  surprise that such a powerful soul has been bound and that
  too, very meticulously. Second is the one who binds –
  who is it? Can we see it? Can we feel that our soul is in
  bondage?
  Every person living on the earth has accepted this fact
  that he is in bondage. Therefore he is trying to get
  liberated. He is trying to get salvation. It is a firm
  perception that we are in bondage and our soul is bound.
  The soul, which is beyond the five physical elements,
  beyond the mind and the brain and is immortal, is bound -
  but how?
  If there is a knot somewhere, it can be opened. Let us
  try to see what kind of knot is there and how can we open
  it? This can be done only when we ascertain where and
  what kind of knot is there. Similarly in order to salvage
  the soul, it is imperative to know who has tied it, how it
  has been tied etc. Without this complete knowledge we
  will never be able to free our soul.
  _Vastu Kahin Dhoondhay Kahin, Kehi Vidhi Aavey Haath._
  _Kahen Kabir Bhedi Liya, To Pal Mein Det Lakhaat._


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 9
_Kabir Sahib has said that we will not find the object we are
looking for, if we do not search for it in the right place. And if
we consult the person who has the exact idea of it, we will be
able to find it in an instant_
Nose gives us the sense of smell. Ears give us the sense
of sound, and the skin gives us the sense of touch. The
mouth or the tongue is both a Karmendriya and a
Gyanendriya. It gives us sense of taste. The human body is
decorated with these 10 indriyas (sensory organs). With its
twenty five characteristics we can understand the whole
game of the body very well. This can never be the soul.
When a man dies, his dead body is taken to the cemetery.
The earth element consigns to the earth, air consigns to air
and so on. The reality of the body is being understood.
Thus our soul is not the body but we are considering the
body as the immortal truth. This body, which is visible,
cannot be the soul because it is perishable. The five
physical elements are perishable. The physical elements
cannot be the soul. The littérateurs (shashtries) have called
it dirty and mortal. Learned people and Sants have never
called this body as immortal. _Panch Tattva Ko Adham
Sharira_**.**
_This body is made up of the five elements and is dirty._
All the senses of this body are involved in enjoying the
worldly pleasures.
_Panch Sakhi Piyu Piyu Karat Hain, Bhojan Chahat Nyari
Nyari.
All the five senses in our body are continuously seeking their
respective pleasures
Panch Tattva Ko Tan Rachyo, Jaanat Sant Sujaan.
Isme Kachu Sancho Nahin, Yeh Nanak Sanchi Maan.
Guru Nanak says that this body is made of the five elements as
told by Sants. But this is not the ultimate truth._
Sahib is also saying -
_Yeh Tan Vish Ki Belari, Guru Amrat Ki Khan.
Shish Diye Jo Guru Mile, To Bhi Sasta Jaan._


10 Sahib Bandgi
_Kabir Sahib is saying that this body is like the poison ivy while
the true Guru is a minefull of nectar. Even if you have to lay
your life to get such a Guru then too it as a steal._
Thus we can infer from the words of the Sants that this
body is dirty, full of vices and is prone to several diseases.
Going by this argument, our body can never be the soul.
The second thing which is visible is the personality. In
such a situation how should we search for the soul?
_Jaise Doodh Doodh Dadhi Maakhan,
Bin Mathe Bhed Na Ghee Ka.
Just as you cannot see the clarified butter or ‘ghee’ in the milk
or curd till you churn it, similarly the soul is hidden in us_
We must try to understand the soul. The other thing which
is visible is personality. What is this? First of all, from no
angle can this body be called the soul. Never, never!
Confusing the body with the soul will be like how a man
from the hilly area, who went on a trip somewhere in the
plains and was thoroughly confused between an elephant
and a guava! Whatever he saw during his trip, he started
jotting down in his diary. If he saw the guava, he wrote
about it. When he saw the elephant, he also wrote about it.
It is natural that, when a man gets some knowledge, he
considers himself to be knowledgeable. One day, he was
with his friend. An elephant was approaching them. His
friend asked, “You have come back from a trip, can you
tell me, what this is? The man consulted his diary and
said, “It is a guava.” His friend said, “How can it be a
guava?!” The man said, “Please wait.” He again consulted
the diary and said, “It is an elephant.” The friend said,
“But an elephant is very big!” The man again consulted
his diary and said, “If it is not an elephant, it must be a
guava.” That is why it is said that, “Little knowledge is
very dangerous.” So our soul is not the body. This is
confirmed. There is no confusion in it, just like the
example of guava or elephant, as given above. Further the


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 11
shape and the structure of the body is not matching with
that of the soul.
First we see the person. Then the other thing being seen is
the ‘personality’. Somebody is of serious nature.
Somebody has a forbearing nature. Some are criminals
and some lecherous. Further this personality has a
relationship with activities. Now this personality too, can
not be the soul because even this has faults. The man is
greedy. He is full of vices. It is no match for the soul at all,
because, the description of the soul given by the Atma-
gyanis (people having the knowledge of soul) is not
matching with the personality. Individuality or Personality
does not match with the soul. There is anger in the former
while the soul does not have anger in it. It also has the
sexual feelings, while there is nothing like that in the soul.
The soul is pure and spiritually awakened (Chetan). Our
soul is within ourselves. In spite of it being spiritually
awakened, it lies within us. The structure of the
personality is very complicated. In this way, personality
also cannot be called the soul.
How is the body functioning? Some say that it is the soul
which activates the body. However the scientists believe
that the body is controlled by the brain. Assume that I ask
somebody to bring water. He immediately runs towards
my vehicle. This task was done within no time. It took less
than a second. The brain asked the memory, “Where is the
water?” The memory told, “It is in the vehicle.” The brain
gave message to the feet and the feet went in the same
direction. It is beyond imagination that all these tasks
were performed at such a speed.
You switch on the mobile. You go to the call section or
you open some other function. There you get an indication
to wait. The computer also works in the same way. If
some command is given, it says,” At present the work is in
progress.” I. e. it gives an indication to stop and wait. But


12 Sahib Bandgi
how wonderful is the human computer? Whatever work is
happening in this computer, is happening at lightning
speed! The computer has been developed on the principles
of human brain. Man has got 2 trillion memory cells while
the computer has much lesser memory. Whatever you
have seen throughout your life, is stored in your memory.
These days' memory chips can record 500 songs and even
store up to 1000 songs. Likewise, there is such a memory
chip in human brain, which records all the incidents of the
life. There are innumerable secrets inside the man. So the
brain is the king of all the cells and sense organs of this
body, with the help of which, every function is performed.
Scientists have proved this fact. Sometimes the power to
feel is reduced. Sometimes the memory is reduced. One
man said to me, “I am a clerk. I had a head injury. Now,
when somebody asks me about my job, I take some time
to reply. I cannot reply immediately.” That is, he has
developed a defect of understanding the things a little late.
I said to him, “The cells are stressed due to injury. Those
cells, which comprehend, are stressed.” They are still
working but due to the injury, are not able to work
properly. Likewise if someone’s leg is hurt, he cannot
walk properly, he starts limping. All the systems of the
body are connected with the brain. Hence our brain cannot
be the soul. If someone hurts you, you become angry.
Why did you feel angry? The brain is responsible for the
entire body. You are aware, if your feet are hurt, you are
disturbed. If hands are hurt, you are disturbed. Wherever
you are hurt, the brain gets a message. The brain does not
accept the situation. If someone is responsible for this
injury, it immediately instructs you to beat him. Why did it
not just accept this situation as is - because this is its
responsibility? Our body is full of consciousness. It is also
complete with soul, but it is not the soul, because its
characteristics and nature etc. do not match with those of


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 13
the soul in any way. The soul is spiritually simple. It is
beyond the merits and is unique. Hence there is no
question of it being hostile. It was the game of sense
organs and the brain. Should we focus only on
personality? The man did not go beyond this. He did not
go beyond this, I. e man’s quest ended at this point. Now
the question is, is the brain supreme? What is the role of
soul in this? It is going through the cycles of birth and
death according to its deeds (karma). Even in Gita,
Krishna has told Arjun, “O Arjun! Just like the man
changes into new clothes after discarding the old ones’,
similarly the soul is getting into the new body after
leaving the old one in accordance to the good and bad
deeds done in the present life.
Now the question arises about the relation of the soul
with the Law of Actions? What actions is it performing?
The man is doing four different types of activities. First,
he is earning his livelihood through private or Govt. jobs.
He is doing this work with the help of his brain. Second,
he is doing farming. He is doing researches also here.
Third, he is doing business. Four, he is involved in frauds.
Thus, he is doing four types of work. What is the purpose
of doing all these actions? What is the need for these?
What is the sense? What is the importance? We are doing
all these actions in order to fulfill our physical and mental
requirements. But none of these are related to the soul.
That is why Sahibji is saying-
_Jeev Pada Bahu Loot Mein, Na Kachhu Len Na Den.
Kabir Sahibji is saying that Jeev/soul is being involved in all
the worldly activities without any gain to the soul._
The soul has nothing to do with all these. We shall have
to understand the role of the soul. Surely, it is involved
somewhere due to which it gets the punishment. If some
female commits suicide, her mother-in-law, brother-in-
law, sister-in-law and other relatives in the house are


14 Sahib Bandgi
arrested. Why? This is because they all are contributing to
it. The case is filed in the court. The court investigates
whether these persons were giving her tension. If she was
tensed, perplexed it could lead to more and more tension.
When she did not find any solution, she thought of killing
herself. She thought that the solution to this problem is the
suicide and killed her through the possible means. Now,
who were involved in this crime? Those, who were
involved, were punished.
Is soul in any way involved in this sinful act? Yes, it is,
but it is engaged uselessly. What does it have to do with
eating and drinking? After eating something, you say that
you enjoyed it. Actually your senses enjoyed it. All are
working to satisfy your physical needs. No work is being
done for the soul. Then, why is the punishment meted to
it? The mother-in-law is also put behind the bars because
she was involved. She should have paid attention to why
her daughter-in-law was disturbed. Now why the law does
punish her? When the deceased left her parents’ house, she
became the daughter-in-law. Her in-laws should have
played the role of parents. The duty of the brother/sister-
in-law was to treat her like his/her own sister. If such a
treatment was not meted, the law punished them. But why
is our soul being punished? How the soul is involved in all
this and why is there this cycle of rebirth? It is said that
the soul is going into different bodies according to its
deeds. It means that somewhere or the other, our soul is
definitely involved. That is why, our soul is being
punished. In fact it is involved in all our actions. One
person said, “Whatever bad actions, I am doing, must be
due to the mind and whatever good actions, I am
performing, must be due to the soul,” I said, “No, both
types of actions are being done by the mind only.” The
soul is beyond both types of actions. It has nothing to do


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 15
with the actions. Both are the creations of the mind only.
Hence, Kabir Sahib said -
_Pap Punya Ye Dono Beri, Ek Loha Ek Kanchan Keri.
Kabir sahibji is saying that both bad deeds and good, virtuous
deeds are like the links of a chain which is used to bind the
soul. The only difference is that one is made of iron and the
other is of gold._
A chain is a chain, whether it is made of gold or iron.
Thus both types of these actions (good or bad) are binding
the soul. But if the body has to do some deeds, it should
perform only good deeds and that too without expecting
returns for them. If you do anything expecting a return,
then rebirth is bound to happen. Then you have to take
birth to enjoy the fruits. Hence, good deeds should be
done without the expectation of return. Now let us see, in
which deeds is the soul involved? It is involved in both
good as well as bad deeds. That is why, it is said--
_Jeeva Pada Bahu Loot Mein, Na Kachhu Len Na Den._
Kabir sahibji is saying that our soul is in big loot. It
has the involvement, but of course, has nothing to gain
from all this. Where is the involvement of our soul, due to
which it has to enter the endless cycle of rebirths. What is
the constitution of the personality? What is there in it?
When somebody offers you food and asks, what all is
there in it? You put it your mouth and after chewing it,
you tell him that it contains potatoes, tomatoes and salt.
This was recognized by the tongue after tasting it. Even if
you don’t see the salt, you can tell about it after tasting the
food. You go on chewing and keep telling its constituents.
Let us see, what is the constitution of the personality?
First thing, that we find, is the mind. Creating desires is
the nature of mind. The second thing which we see is the
brain. How can it be seen? Just like after tasting the food,
it could be ascertained, what are its ingredients? Similarly
we can see it working. When we take decisions it was


16 Sahib Bandgi
actually the Mind’s work. We are taking decisions even
while we are moving. Thus, the mind is seen. Then the
Memory can also be seen. Every moment you are
remembering something or the other. The activity of the
brain can also be seen. When we are working, it is an
activity coordinated by the mind. The anger is also being
seen. All these things are seen in everybody. The virtuous
and sinful deeds are also seen. The lust is also seen. The
anger is also seen. This way the mind can be seen in
totality.
Man tries to deceive others. One man wanted to
donate some land to me. He told me that he would donate
100 Bighas (One Bigha =27225 sq ft). I said, “No
problem.” He requested me to pay the cost of ten bighas
of land only, so that he could pull on his family. I asked
my people to investigate. When the investigation was
done, it was found that he owned only ten bighas and the
price, he was demanding, was 5 times more. He was
talking of 100 bighas of land. The rest belonged to the
Govt. This is called cheating. Is the soul doing this? Do
not think that such fraudulent behavior is not found in the
common man. Everyone is doing this, because it is the
habit of mind.
_Koyee Safa Na Dekha Dil Ka.
Billi Dekhi Bagula Dekha, Sarpa Jo Dekha Bil Ka.
Upar Upar Sunder Lage, Bhitar Gola Pathap Ka.
Koyee Safa Na Dil Ka Dekha.
Kabir sahibji is saying that he could not find anyone who has a
clean heart, neither the cat nor the stork and not even the
snake. All the creatures look good externally but do not have a
clear conscience._
Some people come to me after doing something wrong
and request me to forgive them. I ask them to, “First tell
me the mistake. You should not try to get pardoned
cunningly.”


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 17
Once upon a time there was king, called Dawood. He
had a servant-Uriyah. The king had nine queens. Dawood
was known as a prophet (Paigamber). He was an
accomplished priest (Sidh and Sadhak) also. One day he
saw his servant Uriyah’s wife. He found her very
beautiful. Dawood thought of getting her. He thought, “If
her husband is alive, she could never be his.” He sent
Uriyah to the forest on the pretext of some work. Next he
sent 4-6 soldiers and asked them to kill him. They killed
Uriyah. Now the king took Uriyah’s wife with him.
Dawood was a prophet. One day, while praying, he felt as
if he has done some blunder. Dawood was seeing the
Heaven with one eye and the hell with the other. He was
terrified. He asked God to forgive him. The God said to
him, “He has forgiven, but He cannot forgive the murder
of Uriyah.” If Uriyah forgives, He will forgive too.” He
went to Uriyah’s grave and called him. When he called out
the third time, he got a reply from the grave.” Yes
master!” The king said, “I am Dawood, your master.” Yes,
I am seeing.” said Uriyah. Dawood said, “I have come
here to ask for your pardon.” Uriyah asked, “Pardon for
what?” The king told, “Due to me, you have lost your
life.” At this Uriyah said “No problem, I had to do my
work. I forgive you.” The king came back and said, “O
God! Uriyah has forgiven me.” The God said, “This is not
a pardon. There is cunningness in it. Go and tell Uriyah
that, in order to get your wife, I myself plotted to kill
you.” The king again went to Uriyah’s grave and called.
On the third call, a voice came from the grave, “What is
the matter, Master!” The king said, “I have come to ask
for your pardon.” Uriyah said, “I have already forgiven
you.” This time, the king told Uriyah the entire story. He
said, “I plotted to kill you in order to get your wife. No
person, who is against you, has killed you.” The voice


18 Sahib Bandgi
from the grave said, “I cannot forgive you till the Dooms’
Day.”
Sometimes, I too am surprised, what type of pardon
is this? The man is full of deceit. All his actions are being
governed by the cunning mind. All these actions are
related to the personality. That is why it is said—
_Dil Ka Hujara Saf Kar, Jana Ke Aane Ke Liye.
Dhyan Auron Ka Hata, Usko Bithane Ke Liye.
Ek Dil Lakhon Tamanna, Uspe Bhi Jyada Havas.
Phir Thikana Hai Kahan’ Usko Bithane Ke Liye.
Clean your heart to let in your beloved Guru. Clear your
thoughts and focus on your Guru. In your heart there will be
no place for him if it's full of greed and desires for worldly
things_
Sometimes people come to me cunningly. I tell them,
“Come to me with purity. Don’t come to me with
cunningness in your mind.”
_Guru Lobhi Shishya Lalachi, Dono Khele Danov.
Kahain Kabir Kaise Taren, Charh Patthar Ki Naav.
Kabir Sahib says if both the Guru and his disciple are greedy
then it is like trying to the cross river by getting in a boat made
of stone_
One day, a man came to me and said, “My wife has
filed an FIR against me. The police are searching for me.
Please talk to her over the telephone” I said, “Give me
your wife’s telephone number.” While I was busy trying to
call her, he ran away.” See, he had come to deceive me. A
wife regards her husband as her guardian. Why will she
like to put her husband behind the bars? When I asked her,
she told, “He beats me a lot.” Next time, when he met me,
I asked him, “Give me her phone number.” He gave such a
wrong number, which even the telephone company might
never be able to connect. The first thing I asked him was if
he was beating his wife. He said, “No.” I tell the females
who come to me that if their husbands beat them then
lodge an FIR in police stations’ - women cell.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 19
What was this? They are deceiving themselves! Such
cunning behavior is not acceptable. If someone is
behaving in such a manner, he is surely confused. The
heart should be clean like a mirror. Sahibji is saying-
_Andar Safa, Baahar Safaa, Phir Sahib Kahe Khafaa.
(Kabir Sahib says” when someone has clear conscience and is
pure in his dealings with the outside world, he is sure to win
the Supreme Lord’s love and affection”)_
I want to say that in all the actions- good or bad, right
or wrong, the soul is involved. It is certainly involved, or
else it would not get the punishment. Due to its
cooperation alone the mind is able to get its job done.
However the question is: Why is it taking orders from the
mind? What is it doing? Let us explore a little.
Is the punishment justified or not? Why is it involved?
Is our soul merely a spectator or an active participant?
Actually our soul is not only a spectator but an active
participant too. That is why, it is being punished. Your
soul is cooperating. Now the question arises, why is it
cooperating? It is cooperating in each and every action. If
a man murders someone, is his soul not guilty? It is guilty.
If it is not guilty, then, why is it being punished? Is it all
anarchy? No, it is fully cooperating. It is involved in all
the actions. What is the reason? In which way is it a
criminal?
If the daughter-in-law was set on the fire, the mother-
in-law was sent to the jail. Why did she not understand the
problem? Why did she not co-operate with her? If the
daughter- in-law has hanged herself, the background was
prepared by the mother-in-law. Likewise, the soul too has
been jailed.
Surely, the soul is copartner, but no fault of its own.
That is why, it is said—
_Jeeve Pade Bahu Loot Mein, Na Kachhu Len Na Den.
Our soul has nothing to gain or loose with any action_.


20 Sahib Bandgi
It has got no relation with any act being done, but in
every act, even in the worst of the acts, the soul is
involved. Being in the body since a long time, it has
started considering the body and mind as its own. Hence,
it is necessary to purify it. Our soul has been dirtied by the
mind.
_Bandhyau Keet Markat Ki Nayeen.
That is to say that the soul is tied like an ordinary bird, a
monkey etc_.
It is said---
_Jad Chetan Hai Granthi Pad Gayee, Yaddyapi Mithya
Chhootat Kathinayee._
The soul is completely tied, but nobody is able to
understand, where is the knot? Sahib says-
_Yaddyapi Mithya Chhootat Kathinayee._
The soul has not been tied, but it in bondage. There is
no knot to be seen but it’s still not free. This has been
explained beautifully—
_Aapa Ko Aapa Hi Bandhyau.
The soul has bound itself._
The whole game is of mind and the soul is fully
engrossed in it. The mind is directing this whole game
taking the energy from the soul. So the soul is getting the
punishment. That is why, Sahib is saying -
_Maan Jata Hai Jane De, Gahke Raakh Sharer.
Utara Pada Kaman Se, Kya Kar Sakta Tir.
Kabir Sahibji has said that even if your mind desires/yearns for
something, just move on without paying attention to it because
your mind is powerless if the soul does gives its energy. Just as
an arrow is useless without a bow._
There is warning in Sahib’s words. They are not merely
stories. While driving we see that when a speed-breaker
approaches, a signboard cautioning you to slow down is
put a little ahead of it. Similarly Sahib’s words are
cautionary. He gave us warning signals.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 21
So the soul is cooperating. If the soul had not
cooperated and not given its energy, nothing would have
happened. The brain could not have done any work. It is
not all-powerful. The imagination (desire) is of mind. Our
soul is our concentration. This concentration is wandering.
If we try to meditate, it focuses only on worldly things.

_Man Maya Mein Bandh Rahyo, Bisryo Naam Govind.
Keh Nanak Sun Re Mana, Ant Paryo Jim Fand.
Guru Nanak says that our involvement in the world leads us to
forget our almighty and due to this we are put again and again
in the cycle of rebirth._
When meditating, we are reminded, how someone has
abused us and our attention is diverted towards him. When
we bring our focus back and we try to meditate again, we
get entangled in some other things all over again.
Somewhere or the other, this concentration is being
diverted. The power which has tied us, is not allowing us
to be free.
_Manahin Swarupi Deo Niranjan, Tohi Rakh Bharmayee.
Hey Hamsa Tu Amarlok Ka, Para Kal Vash Aye.
Kabir sahib says that Niranjan has taken the form of our mind
and kept us all in the dark, never allowing us to know about
Amarlok which is the original abode of our soul._
Everyone in the world is saying that the mind should
not be troubled. But, we are saying—
_Jo Maan Par Aswar Hai, Aisa Birla Koye.
Kabir sahib has said that rare are those who can fully control
their mind._
Sahib is saying—
_Man Ke Mate Na Tu Chal Bhai, Palak Palak Maan Aur.
Kabir Sahib has said that we should not do anything which our
mind tells us because it has a tendency to change every second._
Thus, the soul is tied. Sometimes we are worried about
our daughter’s education, sometimes about her marriage,
sometimes about our wife or about the construction of our


22 Sahib Bandgi
house. The mind has entangled the soul in so many things.
All these things seem dear to us. On the other hand, the
man also wants salvation, but is not able to come out of
these worries.
Further, our brain is also not all-powerful. It is the
secretary. It takes the orders from the mind.
_Sukhman Maddhye Base Nirajana, Munda Daswan Dwara.
Uske Upar Makar Tar Hai, Chadho Saamhar Samhara.
Kabir Sahib says that Niranjan resides in the middle of our
Sushmana nerve and above it, there is a very fine Spider’s web
like thread on which we need to move our concentration
cautiously._
Where there is darkness, there is the Ether element (Akash
tattva) and this is where our mind i.e. Niranjan lives. He
lives in darkness. He sends the messages in the form of
waves from there. He is the King.
_Teen Lok Mein Magahi Viraji, Tahi Na Chinhat Pandit Kaji.
Kabir sahib is saying that our mind/Niranjan is omnipresent in
the all the three worlds and neither pandits nor kazis can
recognize it._
The mind gives these orders and the brain executes them.
_Shruti Puran Bahu Kahein Samujhayee, Chhute Na Adhik
Adhik Arujhayee.
Tulsidas is saying that all the religious scriptures are
repeatedly telling us that instead of becoming free we will get
all the more entangled in this mystical world_
We are talking of pure devotion. That is why superstitious
people want to eliminate us. They even won’t mind using
an atom bomb to do so.
_Chaaron Or Jab Mar Mar Jo Dhaye, Tab Lalon Ke Lal
Khalaye_**.**
_Kabir sahib is saying when everyone disagrees with the Guru
to the extent of assaulting him physically, only then should we
consider real Satguru._
One Maulavi (Muslim priest) came to me. He was an
old man. He said to me, “I want to make you my teacher


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 23
(Guru).” He added, “I am observing you for quite some
time. You seem to be a pure soul. I shall bring eighty
members from my family too (to make them your
disciple).” I told him that I am ready and that he had to
take everyone in confidence first. After getting blessed
with the holy Name, he would have to leave all the vices.
He would have to follow all the rules of the Ashram. So be
prepared. I told him that I was ready. He would have to
stop sacrificing animals on Bakrid. He could retain his
beard if he so desired, I was not concerned with it. He
might be a follower of any religion; it did not matter to
me. I told him “Just see that you follow the Rules. Don’t
cheat anybody. Don’t tell a lie and do not consume meat. I
am making you pure. I am giving you seven Rules.
Observe them.”
Even, if a prostitute comes to me, I shall bless her with
the holy Name, but she shall have to follow the Seven
Rules. All the vices will automatically go away. I will
make you pure. If you are a Muslim, I will make you a
pure Muslim. If you are a Hindu, I will make you a pure
Hindu. If Sikh, you will become a pure Sikh. Anyone,
who eats bitter gourd, will feel its bitterness.
So the soul is bound. The mind, residing in the
Sushumna nadi (nerve) sends the messages to the brain.
The brain is incapable of understanding the origin of these
messages. The soul is in the inner-self and it does not
understand that the whole game is that of the mind. That is
why, it is said—
_Tera Bairee Koyee Nahin, Tera Bairee Maan.
Kabir Sahib is saying that nobody else but our own mind is
your enemy._
Our soul resides in the Agya Chakra (the centre of the
forehead). After mixing with the breath, it is spread out in
the whole body and is passing its energy to all the nerves.


24 Sahib Bandgi
The soul also mistook itself as Mind, as whole body, after
mixing with the breath.
The Guru (teacher) concentrates the soul. Then, the person
begins to understanding the game of mind (Niranjan) and
body (maya). Now, they can clearly see the whole scheme
of things. Sahib says-
_Jab Main Tha Tou Guru Nahin, Ab Guru Hai Main Nahin.
Prem Gali Ati Sankri, Ta Mein Dui Na Samahin.
Kabir Sahib is saying that when I was without the holy Name, I
had no qualities of my Guru.but after Naam Initiation I have
my guru’s characteristics in me. My vices which I previously
had in me, have disappeared_
I am not telling you to concentrate on any part of your
body. I am not even telling you to awaken deeper inner-
cells through concentration. I am telling you to awaken
your concentration (Surati) itself. There are five postures
(Mudras) of meditation. I am telling that all these are full
of demerits.
After sometime, the use of mobile phone will be totally
stopped. I never had any tension. One day I had the
headache. On analyzing, I concluded that it was due to the
mobile phone. At that time, the mobile phone was recently
introduced. Till that time, the scientists had said nothing
about it. I was the first person to tell about its side effects.
I also told that the population of the vultures and the small
birds had reduced. Scientists as well as biologists had not
mentioned anything about this till that time. The vultures
are not many in number. The process of its birth is also
quite difficult. They cannot build their nest inside the tree
because of their large wing span. Due to this, they build
their nest on the tree top. Some years earlier, there were
harsh weather conditions during the winter. There was
worst frost and as a result, their eggs got destroyed.
Hence, their number decreased even further. They were
already few in numbers.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 25
The vultures are capable of seeing up to 1000 kms (80
Yojan). You can see vultures flying at a great height. It is
the vultures, who collide with the aero planes. They can
see a dead animal, lying in Agra, from Mumbai (some
1000 kms away). Just think, what an incredible vision,
they have? Then they inform the other vultures. The entire
flock goes there and eats it. In the Hindu epic Ramayana,
there is an episode, where, the king of vultures, Jataayu
had seen and told about Sitaji’s presence at Ravana’s
Ashok Vatika across the sea in Lanka (now Sri Lanka).
When some grains fall down on the ground in your
house, you cannot see them but the birds come and feed
on them. You are not able to understand, what they were
feeding on.
These small birds have, also, reduced in numbers.
Sometime back they were moving in flocks. These birds
avoid the areas, where the mobile signals are present. The
mobile-phone is harmful for the nature too. After
sometime, the man will stop using it, but at present its
necessity is being felt.
Thus, the concentration (surati) is very unique. It has
the power to see everything. This concentration itself is
our soul. This surati gets divided into seven parts in the
body, but it is one only. Just as there are nine parts of the
body e. g. neck, nose, hand and shoulders etc., but the
body as a whole is one. In the same way, this surati also
gets divided into seven parts, e.g. Anand Surati, Mool
Surati, Chamak Surati etc. All the functions of the body
are performed by these suratis. This has to be concentrated
at one point only. It is very powerful. This power is being
used for meeting the needs of the body. This treasure of
energy is with everyone.
Everybody understands the needs of one’s body because,
it requires energy. Everybody is, therefore, slave to the
needs of the body. The surati does not require energy,


26 Sahib Bandgi
hence nobody paid attention towards it. Sahib has spoken
about this surati in the following lines –

_Surati Samhale Kaaj Hai, Tu Mat Bharam Bhulaye.
Maan Sayyad Manasa Lahar Mein, Bahat Katahun Na Jaye.
Kabir sahib is saying that we need to be vigilant of our mind
because it keeps distracting us from the correct path. Also we
need to keep our concentration from wandering away in order
to move in the direction of salvation._

```
Dharam Dass ji Asks Sant Kabir Sahib to Kindly tell me
about the 14 yamas.
Dharam Dass Ji Teke Gahi Paun,
Nam Jaman Kau Mohi Sunaun.
Chaudah Yam Mohi Varni Sunao,
Daya Kerhu Jani Mohi Durao.
Kabir Sahib says, “Chitara Gupat is the head of all the
Yamas. He keeps an account of the sins and merits. He
has an army of Mrityuandha, Agni, Chitchanchal,
Acheta,
Makrandi and the like with him. These have held the
Jiva
in bondage.
The Jivas were frightened to see the fearful appearance
of Kaal (Niranjan). They prayed for their safety. The
echo
of their prayer reached Param Purush. He asked me (at
that time called as Jog Santain) to free the helpless and
suffering jivas from the net of Kaal.”

#### My Satguru Sent Me To The

#### Abode Of Supreme Lord

The true father of the soul is only Satguru (Knower of
Truth) and the true religion is followed by the disciples of
the Satguru. The glory and the benefit of the soul are in
surrendering to the Satguru. The politeness and spiritual-
simplicity are found in Satsang (Satguru’s discourses).
The bliss and satisfaction of the soul are in chanting the
holy Name. The feeling of forgiveness can be developed
in the presence of the Satguru. The knowledge and
rationality of the soul are in Satguru’s words due to which
vices like greed, attachment and pride are destroyed. The
words of Satguru awaken the surati (concentration), due to
which the desires, greediness and the brain come under
control. Satguru-Sahib has given such a True holy Name
due to which, all the cheatings of the wicked mind can be
understood. O soul! You have been fortunate to get the
human body so that you can understand the true religion
from Satguru. Bestowing it with the holy Name, Satguru-
sahib has given the soul the salvation and cleared its way
to the Supreme Lord’s own abode-AmarLok (Sat Loka).

```

28 Sahib Bandgi

#### He Is Found In The Body

_Jehi Khojat Kalpo Bhaye, Ghat Hi Maahin So Moor._
The man has been searching for the Supreme Lord since
a long time. Billions and billions (Kalpanter) of years
have passed away. Ages (unlimited years) have passed by.
This search is not new. We can see that some small
children are very intelligent. Some are docile while others
are not. The question arises, who has taught them to be
indocile? There was a child aged seven years. His mother
told me that he was very stubborn. A child of seven years
is being stubborn! This is by the virtue of his deeds in
previous life (sanskar). All your births till date have been
properly documented. Hence Kabir Sahib has said-
_Janam Ek Nahin Janam Aneka, Chhute Nahin Bhakti Ko
Lekha.
He is saying that the virtues and vices of our previous lives are
carried forward in our next birth and our actions will be
moderated accordingly by our Mind_
The virtues of the deeds of past life remain
_Karma Sani Buddhi Utpani.
Our thoughts get moulded according to the deeds of previous
lives_
The Mind is found in every creature of this living
kingdom. There is a buffalo. It keeps its place very neat
and clean, even better than humans. If need be, it messes
up the neighbor's place, keeping its own place clean. Now
who has taught this buffalo to be so clean? This is due to
the virtues of its past life.
Whatever we are seeing outside, all of it exists inside our
body too. All the ideas have been taken from this body
itself. The idea of a tape-recorder has originated in the
brain itself. The idea of a computer too, has its origin in
the brain. First of all these ideas originated in the Mind.
There are numerous secrets hidden in the human body.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 29
_Kabir Kaya Athah Hai, Koyee Birla Jaane Bhed.
Kabir sahib is saying that our body i.e. the human body is very
vast, almost limitless and there is hardly anybody in this
universe who knows this mystery_
Behind this feeling of our personality, there is a very
subtle element. That is our soul. Hence, the soul is bound
by the mind and body. Sahib has said-
_Manahi Swaoopi Dev Niranjan, Tohi Raha Bharmayee.
Hey Hansa Tu Amar Lok Ka, Pada Kal Vash Ayee.
Kabir Sahib is saying that our mind (maan) has manifested
itself as our god and kept us in dark. Our soul, which has come
from Amarlok, has been detained here in this mortal body by
Niranjan/Kaal_
Thus, this personality is not helpful in understanding
our self. Sahib says-
_Yeh Kaya Hai Samarath Keri, Kaya Ki Gati Kahu Na Heri.
Kabir Sahib is saying that this human body is capable of
innumerable incredible things, but, alas! No one has tried to
know its secrets_
Even the great learned men and women are incapable of
knowing the secrets of this body. Everything has come
from this body itself.
_Ya Ghat Bhitar Sat Samandar, Ya Hi Mein Nadiya Nara.
Ya Ghat Bhitar Surj, Chanda, Ya Hi Mein Navlakh Tara.
Ya Ghat Bhitar Sona Chandi, Ya Hi Mein Lagat Bazaara.
Ya Ghat Bhitar Hira Moti, Ya Hi Mein Parkhanhara.
Ya Ghat Bhitar Kashi, Mathura, Ya Hi Mein Ghar Samsara.
Ya Ghat Bhitar Devi Deota, Ya Hi Mein Thakurdwara.
Ya Ghat Bhitar Brhma, Vishnu, Shiv Sankadi Apara.
Ya Ghat Bhitar Riddhi Siddhi Ke, Bhare Atal Bhandara.
Ya Ghat Bhitar Teen Lok Hai, Ya Hi Mein Sirjanhara_**.**
Here Kabir Sahib is saying that our body has got
everything that we can see in this entire creation. The
seven oceans, the big and small rivers, the Sun, the moon,
the ninety million stars, the riches, the gems, the pilgrim
places, the gods, the goddesses, innumerable supernatural


30 Sahib Bandgi
powers, the three worlds and its creator, all exist in our
human body
Who is the king of such a great body? Sahib says-
_Teen Lok Mein Manahin Biraji, Tahi Na Chinhat Pandit Kazi._
The mind rules the three worlds (three Lokas).
Everybody believes that it is he himself, who is thinking.
But this thought originates in the mind itself. Your belief
that you exist, is also due to the mind itself. I have
mentioned it earlier too, that the man believes the brain to
be supreme, but this is not so. The waves reach the brain.
These waves are coming from the mind, who resides
above it. As has been said in the following line-
_Maan Tarang Mein Jagat Bhulana_**.**
_The whole world is doing according to the wishes and desires
of the mind_
These waves reach the Mind in a very subtle form.
Sometimes, you desire that you have to go a particular
place for picnic. Why did this desire arise in you? You
have not thought about it seriously. The fact is that this is
not your desire. This has been thrust upon you by your
mind. This desire has been thrust on you so subtly that you
are unable to understand this secret. These are very subtle
waves. The desire came to you through these subtle
waves, but you have accepted it as your desire. The truth
is that this was not your desire. You are a very unique
being. You are a pure soul. There are no desires in your
soul. Your soul has no likes and dislikes. The soul is
beyond desires. Then what is the problem? The problem is
that, the soul is in bondage. Can we see this bondage? Yes,
of course! How can the soul be described? It neither takes
birth nor dies. It is immortal, simple (Sahaj), beyond the
reach of the senses, beyond the ether (Akash tatva) and
beyond the five physical elements. It neither increases nor
decreases. It never gets old and does not die. It is
imperishable, indivisible, free and blissful. Oh! It has such


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 31
wonderful characteristics! Then why is the man not
thinking about all these?
The soul, sometimes, considers itself as mind and
sometimes, as body (maya). When it wants to know about
itself, it is told that it is the body. Just like a man makes a
woman aware of her feminity by the way he looks at her.
This makes her shy and aware of her feminity.
Likewise, your mind makes the soul feel that our soul
is the body, it is the inner-self (Antaratma) and the mind.
The soul is also made to believe that it is the one who is
thinking and having the sexual desire. But has our soul
accepted this? Yes, because it has been misled in this way.
Now what is the nature of the soul? It is entangled. This is
very surprising. The soul, despite being the part of the
Supreme Lord, is cheating others. Even then, He (the
Supreme Lord) is not stopping it. Not only this, the soul is
doing undesirable things. It means, the Supreme Lord,
who is residing within us, has been made weak by some
unusual force. Despite He being the origin of light, there
appears to be the darkness inside the body.
When He (the Supreme Lord) is within everybody, why
is the inner-self of every creature not enlightened? This
means that he is helpless but, He is known to be
Omnipotent. Even then, the person intends to kill others. It
means that Omnipotent Lord is not forbidding him from
the misdeeds. These questions arise in everyone’s minds.
Sometimes people may even complain e. g. on the death
of his wife one might complain “I have small children and
you have snatched their mother from them. It means you
are a butcher. What you have done to me is not
justified.”People tend to complain like this. Even when
such an Omnipotent Lord is sitting inside, the man is
stealing, and He is not preventing him from doing so.
Somebody is raping women. Even then That Lord, living


32 Sahib Bandgi
inside everybody, is not speaking. What is the matter? All
the deeds are being performed in His presence.
If somebody is troubling others, even an onlooker thinks
that he should help him. But that Omnipotent is not
helping. Why is He not helping? He is known to be full of
kindness. Why is His Kindness not showing up? Why is
that blissful Purush oblivious of the sorrows of the
creatures? What is the mystery? Answering this Kabir
Sahib said:
_Sab Ghat Mera Saiyan, Khali Ghat Na Koye.
Balihari Wa Ghat Ki, Jag Hat Pargat Hoye
Sahib says that my God is present in all the living things in an
apparent way and none are devoid of him. However we need to
revere the person in whom the almighty shows his presence_
He is not in action at present inside anyone’s body. The
ghee (clarified butter) is present in the milk. We use ghee
in various ways. It is used to light the earthen lamp. It is
eaten in various other ways. The puri (Indian bread) is
deep fried in it. It is not possible to deep fry puris in milk.
We light the lamp with ghee. This cannot be done using
milk. The ghee has to be extracted from the milk. If the
Omnipotent does not appear, He will not help. When we
try to make Him appear, some opposite force restricts Him
from appearing. The fact is that, The Supreme Power is
inside our body.
_Jyon Til Mahin Tel Hai, Jyon Chakamak Mein Aag.
Tera Sayin Tujh Mein, Jag Sake To Jag.
Kabir Sahib says that just like the sesame seed has oil in it and
the quartzite stone(chakmak) has sparks of fire in it, similarly
the Supreme lord resides in you. You need to understand and
realize his presence in you_
Oh! There is redness in the henna leaves extract, but it
is unable to produce its effect, unless the extract is applied
on palms. Some evil force is not allowing that Supreme
Lord to appear. To make him visible, we require the help
of the Satguru (true guru). At the time of Initiation, the


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 33
Satguru removes all the covers which are on the Supreme
lord inside us and strengthens our soul. Only then, the
Supreme Lord living inside the body becomes active. I
bought a sim. It was not active. I asked a person, “Why is
it not active? What is the reason?” He told, “That has to be
activated.”
All the elements are present inside the earth. They can
be taken out with some technique. If the sourness has to
be extracted, we sow a lime-seed. It extracts the sourness
from the earth. If the sweetness has to be extracted, then
sugarcane has to be planted. It extracts the sweetness from
the earth.
So, there is the need of a teacher (guru), otherwise He
(the Supreme Lord) cannot be activated. Believe me! Only
a complete guru (Satguru) can activate Him. From that
day, He has been activated within you, He is surely
working. The opposing forces are also living within your
body, but they are now helpless. I have made you different
from the world. I have activated Him within you. Now, He
is working, but His presence cannot be felt by the brain or
the memory. Even our intelligence will not understand
Him. He really works within you. He makes his presence
felt to you and you are assured.
In Bhopal during my discourse, I asked, “Those, who
feel that the divine-power is working in them, should raise
their hands.” A good number of people raised their hands.
A person who is the Director in the Health Department for
M.P., Chhattisgarh, Dadar-Haveli and Andman-Nikobar
Island also raised his hand. I asked him, “Are you sure?”
He said, “I had gone to Gwalior to fix the marriage of my
daughter. While returning my driver said that he was
feeling drowsy and that we should take a break. I sent the
driver to the back seat and I started driving myself. On the
way, over a bridge, I also dozed off. At that point of time,
a truck was approaching us from the opposite direction.


34 Sahib Bandgi
Our vehicle was moving at a high speed. All of a sudden,
the break was applied to my vehicle and the accident was
avoided. The accident was destined. I knew it very well
that the brake which stopped my vehicle was not my
effort. All that I felt was that a power came out of my
body and after completing the task, went away without
letting me know anything about it, but I understood it. I
felt the presence of that Power.” Thus I want to say that
That Power is within you too. It (Power) has been infused
within you, but the condition is, “Keep your faith intact in
your Guru.” Is this bullyism? No, because if you are not
devoted to Sahib, you are definitely in Niranjan’s clutches.
If somebody has fallen sick, he will become alright one
day. This is His automatic desire. He will surely be O.K.
because-
_Jeev Adham Aur Neech Hai, Isko Mat Patiyay._
Don’t deceive the Guru (teacher). Be careful.
_Guru Se Kare Kapat Kare Chaturaye, So Nar Bhav Bhatke Aye
Kabir sahib warns us to be true to our guru or else we would
not get salvation
Guru Se Kapat Sadhu Ki Chori, Ya To Andha Ya To Korhi.
Kabir sahib is warning us not to deceive the guru or else we
would have to face dire consequences like we may become
blinded or a lepor_
Speak the truth. Be clear; be matured, as the Supreme
Lord resides in clean heart only.
_Jab Talak Vishayon Se Yeh Dil, Dur Ho Jata Nahin.
Tab Talak Sadhak Vichara, Chain Sukh Pata Nahin.
Kar Nahin Sakta Hai Jo, Ekagra Apni Vrittiyan.
Usko Sapne Mein Bhi, Parmatam Nazar Aataa Nahin.
We will find true happiness only when we are free of all wants
and desires. Even if we want to have a glance of the Supreme
Lord in our dream, we must focus our attention fully on him_
I have told you seven rules. They are the formula for
cleaning the inner self. We all know that the dyer does not
dye a cloth which is dirty.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 35
_Kaali Kambali Na Rangi Jaaye._
If he dyes the dirty cloth, the colour will bleed out with
the dirt on washing and a patch without the new colour
will appear. Similarly, the tailor does not sew dirty clothes.
Why, because, there are chances of breaking the needle. I
have asked you to stop consuming alcohol and meat at
least three months before coming to me for Initiation. I
also warn you not to indulge in any vices henceforth,
because the heart has to be kept pure. Only then, the
reflection of Sahib will come into your heart.
_Kaam, Krodh, Mad, Lobh Ki, Jab Lagi Ghat Mein Khani.
Kya Pandit, Kya Murkha, Dono Ek Saman.
Kabir sahib is saying that there is no difference between a
learned man and a mad man until we become free of greed,
anger, lust, attachment and ego_
It does not mean that now after Initiation there is no
lust in you, there is no anger within you. Of course they
are there, but now they are under control. All the vices are
under control now. If these are completely done away
with, there shall be no life anymore. I have brought them
to the zero level myself, but at that point, the life ends. So
you are now aware of these vices. Now you will not like
anyone, who has not taken the Holy Name, even if he is
your father. This is a fact. On the other hand, if you meet
your guru-brother, you feel as if you have met someone
from your family.
So what is this? I have activated your soul. You must
have experienced it. When you are unable to do
something, Sahib’s divine power does it for you. Your
mind and brain are unable to understand this secret, but
your inner-self has understood that a power is working.
You know that. Whenever, you are in trouble and helpless,
a power comes to help you, and after doing your task, it
goes away.

#### Concentration Is Everything

_Teen Lok Mein Mann Hi Viraji,TaahinNa Chinhat Pandit Kazi.
Kabir sahib is saying that mind is ruling all the three worlds
but no one has been able to comprehend this._
Really, is the Mind the king? There was a time, when
Bhopal was under Central Govt. Rule. I have four plots
there. I had to get the building plan approved. All the plots
were properly registered in my name. The concerned
officer demanded extra money for each plot, which would
be credited to Central Govt. a/c. There is no such
provision in the State of Jammu & Kashmir. I paid the
money and took the receipt for it. I knew a few employees
in that department. I asked them, “Why has the
department charged me Rs.40000/- extra?” They told, “If
the area of construction is more than ten
Marle(1marle=272.25sq. ft.), Rs.10000/- for every plot
has to be deposited in Central Government a/c. And the
State Govt. will charge extra. It is the Rule of the Central
Govt.” Likewise, the mind is also ruling this world. Can
we see it? Yes, ofcourse! How? Every man in the world,
thinks that his brain is working and we are following it,
but in reality it is not so.
I have said this earlier too that the scientists say that the
brain is controlling all the functions of our body, but I
have different opinion on this point. We all think that the
brain is controlling the body. No! It is only a minister,
while the king is the mind.
_Man Tarang Mein Jagat Bhulana._
Whatever desires, it (the mind) creates from there, you
move accordingly. The waves from the mind reach our
brain through Shushumna nerve.
There is consciousness in the Shushumna nerve. It is
connected with the spinal cord also. Your legs move due
to this. It goes towards the brain moving from the central


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 37
back portion of your head. Hence I have told you to keep
your back straight while meditating.
The consciousness in the entire body is through
Shushumna only. The Shushumna keeps all the parts of
the body including hands and feet active. If an injection is
administered at a wrong nerve point, there is a likelihood
of developing problems in any part of the body. I know it
and, therefore I advise people to be cautious. I never give
controversial statements. I do not want to increase the
number of my opponents, yet they are increasing. I am
cautioning you against doctors. There are reasons for my
opposition. Tantrics/witch doctors oppose me bitterly.
Why? This is so because I have cautioned you against
them. They will malign your faith. The doctors are also
like them. Whatever I want to make you understand, I
make sure that you have understood.
Be wary of the doctors. They will suggest a surgery
even for a minor problem. That does not mean that there is
dearth of honest doctors. It also does not mean that the
honest engineers are not available, but they are few in
numbers.
The baby takes the birth itself. Do not say that the
mother gives birth to the child. No! The baby comes out of
the mother’s womb itself. On the occasion of Mother’s
day, they show the process of child birth. The labour pain
is excruciating. Inside the mother’s womb, there are two
nerves and the baby has to come out through these two
nerves. The scene is terrible! During child birth, both her
stool and urine pass out of her body. When the labour pain
starts but the mouth of the vagina is open only up to two
centimeters, the doctor knows that the normal delivery is
not possible. At that time, he resorts to surgery. For a
normal delivery to happen, the mouth of the vegina should
open up to four centimeters. Sometimes, the doctor knows
that the normal delivery is possible, yet he recommends


38 Sahib Bandgi
surgery because when the baby itself tries to come out of
the womb it tries to open the vagina with its head but if
the baby’s neck bends, it cannot come out. Just like the
hatching of the eggs the baby tries to come out of the
mother’s womb itself but it can’t. That is a very crucial
moment. The first delivery is very painful. Always get the
first delivery done at a hospital, because if some
complication arises, the doctor will immediately operate
upon. When the labour pain is terrible, the doctor resorts
to surgery. Unfortunately, for the sake of money, even in
the case of normal delivery, some doctors perform
caesarian section. In the same way, for an ordinary head-
ache, they may call for 6-7 X-Ray examinations and may
charge you heavily on the pretext of a tumor and that
immediate surgery is required. Intentionally, they want to
perform surgery. They want a lot of money from you. Man
has become very cruel these days. They are not concerned
about your life. They have got admission in MBBS after
paying Rs.30 to 40lacs. Now they have to recover their
money.
Nowadays, the teachers in Govt. schools are not
teaching properly. Due to this, the parents have no
alternative but to get their wards educated in private
schools. They charge Rs.500/- as fee for the small kids.
When I was studying, the fee charged, was only six paisa
in a year. Today, even for small kids, they charge heavy
fees. Just think about it. Because of the casual approach in
Govt. schools, the Govt. has happily recognized the
private schools and it thinks that its problem is now over,
but along with this, it is their duty to ensure that there
should be no overcharging. These private schools are
exploiting the parents to the maximum.
Today the man has become dangerous, very dangerous.
Even for an ordinary back-pain, the doctors will call for


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 39
surgery, but this is not a correct treatment. This way they
will mess up your entire life.
I always keep my diet balanced. If I have eaten sweet-
corn, I shall immediately balance it by eating two sweet-
oranges. They have a cooling effect. If I eat papaya, I will
eat radish along with it immediately. I never take
medicines.
Every medicine will have a side-effect on your brain.
The medicines will have a detrimental effect on your
mind. That is why, I do not take medicines, but I never
advise this to anybody, otherwise they will oppose me.
Your body itself has a system of healing every disease, but
we have made our body used to medicines. You have
become habituated.
So beware of the doctors! They will ask you to conduct
unnecessary tests. They will suggest immediate surgery.
They will scare you. Even for ordinary stomach-pain, they
will diagnose problem with appendix and for an ordinary
head-ache, a tumor.
Sometimes, it so happens with me that in my food the
salt is in excess, while sometimes there is no salt. If I say
that the milk, offered to me, is hot, the next time the milk
offered will be quite cold.
I do not want to eat food in everybody’s house. I have
many problems in taking food, in sleeping as well as in
drinking water. You get disturbed if you face these
problems even for a day. I do not want to keep telling you
about my problems.
One day at Joginder Nagar Ashram, the boy who was
cooking my food, had infected wounds on his fingers.
This way, whatever he served, was nothing but infection.
Just think! This is the way people want to serve me. If I
tell some specific lady to cook for me at a particular place,
another lady at the same venue will try to sideline her
saying, “How can you cook food for Sahibji? I shall


40 Sahib Bandgi
cook.” Even if, she is suffering from acute asthma but she
will insist. In the same way, some people try to serve me
even against my wishes. However this is not serving me,
rather it is troubling me. Some people try to wash my feet
with such pressure that my feet become fiery hot. This
way they give me pain rather than serving me. If I tell
them to stop, they do not listen. They request me to allow
them to serve for some more time. Oh! What type of
service is this? First of all, you do not know how to do it.
On top of it, you give me pain rather than relief! When
your guru (teacher) is telling to stop, you should obey
him. There is no better service than obeying the guru, but
they are in their own world.
So you get all the messages from the brain. It is the
work of the mind. The mind keeps sending subtle waves
through the Shushumna nerve. Brain does not do it itself.
The messages do not originate from the brain. These
subtle waves are coming from the mind. In this way, mind
keeps you occupied all the 24hours.
I have to clear all your doubts too. One person said
that he had a doubt. He said that Nanak Dev has said,
“The mind should be pure, but you say that the mind is
Kaal. It is Niranjan. There is a big confusion.”
I want just one thing from you and nothing else. I have
my focus on one thing. That is, your faith. I deal in it. It is
a common belief that the mother teaches the baby to walk,
but the fact is that the baby learns to walk on its own. The
mother does not teach it. She only helps it. For walking,
the child has to grip the ground with its toes. It learns this
with continuous practice. The mother helps but she cannot
teach the child to get its grip on the ground.
When the child falls down, it gets hurt and feels the
pain. It does not want to fall down. It wants to learn.
When it sees you walking, it also wants to walk.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 41
Similarly, I need your cooperation and nothing else. All
the required systems are present in your body. The mother
has only supported the baby and sometimes she leaves it
free. Birds also teach their chicks. They teach them to fly
by opening their wings. All are protecting their young
ones, because the soul in present in all.
Likewise, I want your strong will and with its help, I
shall give you salvation (Param Moksha). Only
requirement is that you should remain focused on Sahib.
Though, Niranjan knows that you will get salvation, he
does not want that you to reveal this fact to others. He will
disturb you. He never wants to let you off. Therefore, you
have to be very careful all the time. When you have full
focus, you will experience that a force is moving along
with you. When you are engrossed in the worldly affairs,
you will not feel its presence.
One day, D.C. Saheb (one of my disciples) was telling,
“Your sense of humour is quite unique. I have not seen
anyone like you.”
Earlier, I used to make people laugh a lot. Everybody
used to enjoy it.
On one such occasion a person said, “I see very
peculiar dreams. Wife and children are also scared.” I said,
“It means that there is something wrong in your house.”
He nodded in agreement. I said, “Fool! How did you
accept that there is something in your house? I have said
that in the lighter vein.”
On another occasion I was distributing chapattis
(breads) to sangats (people who participate in the
discourse). A lady, who wanted the chapattis, placed her
plate a little far away from my reach. I asked her, “Can’t
you go back a little further?” She sprang and went back
even further. There is a style of cracking jokes. And the
expressions of the person, who is cracking the joke also


42 Sahib Bandgi
matter. My style of cracking the jokes is such that
everybody laughs to the hilt.
Thus, the soul is in everybody. It is only the game of
concentration. _Surati Kamal Satguru Ko Wasa._
Sahib (Supreme Lord) is present in your
concentration. Therefore, don’t get lost in worldly affairs.
The more, you get engrossed in the worldly affairs, the
more you will move away from the Supreme Lord.
_Surati Ka Khel Sara Hai, Surati Mein Racho Sansara Hai.
Kabir sahib is saying that the entire creation is nothing but the
manifestation of concentration. And this concentration is
making the world go round_
Sahib says-
_Surati Samhale Kaj Hai, Tu Mat Bharam Bhulay.
Man Sayyad Manasa Lahar Mein, Bahat Katahun Na Jay._
Even if, I become repetitive in my discourse, you will
not get bored. I shall keep your focus on me and never
allow you to get bored anytime. All that, you have to do, is
to be attentive. Whatever mistakes, you commit in your
day to day life, happen due to the lack of concentration.
Hence, stay focused fully on me.
_Khavata, Pivata, Sovata, Jagata, Kahain Kabir So Rahe
Mahin_**.**
Our mind can recognize somebody whom we have met
in the past. However, these senses are incapable of making
my correct image in your mind. They get confused. It will
not be possible for you to concentrate on me, because I
shall not meet you if you are under the clutches of mind.
When you are fully focused on me, I shall meet you. All
this is the game of concentration.
_Surati Phansi Sansar Mein, Tate Par Gayo Dhoor.
Surati Bandhi Esthir Karo, Authon Pahar Hujoor._
I am not talking about Surati-shabd-abhyas (one of the
five types of Yoga), but about Surati (Concentration)
Yoga. If you are concentrating on the divine light in the
within you, Niranjan will take on you.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 43
One man said, “You are saying that we need not make
any effort now for salvation, but you are asking me to
concentrate 1 ¼ hands (about 2 feet) above the head. Does
this not amount to performing an activity? Does it not
mean we have to do something?” I said, “Ok from now
onwards don’t do anything. I have told you to practice it
only as a means to keep you concentrated on me.
Concentration has got a great importance. If you do not
concentrate, then the Mind will keep on disturbing you.
Don’t allow your Mind to wander in the world. That is all.
It (mind) has to be entangled in some good work.”
You are getting renunciated (detached from worldly
affairs) automatically. The whole system is operating on
its own. If you have not put the sim-card in your mobile,
the mobile will not be active. And if you try to get some
information without the sim in it, you will not get it. Why?
It is the wonder of a small sim-card. What happened? All
the data is stored in the sim-card itself. Nothing works in
the mobile without sim. This is the wonder of the sim. If
your sim is lost and you get a new sim from the Exchange,
data that was in the old sim is lost. Why did this happen?
All your old data is lost. Where was that data? That sim
was connected with the mobile tower, due to which the
mobile was connected to the tower. Even now, your sim is
connected with the tower, like in the past the old sim was.
However as you got the new sim, your old data is lost
completely.
The concentration is playing a similar role. Always be
careful. Never get too much involved in worldly activities.
Be careful because Niranjan will always try to waiver
your concentration and distract you. Therefore, Sahib
says-
_Man Sayyad Manasa Lahar, Bahat Katahun Na Jaye._


44 Sahib Bandgi
_Be cautious of your mind and don’t follow its commands,
because it is a cheat and will always try to mislead you into
wrongdoing_
This concentration is a marvelous thing.
_Surati Kamal Satguru Ko Vasa_**.**
_Kabir sahib is saying that your Satguru lives in your
concentration in Surati Kamal/the eighth chakra of your body_
I know better than others. I think, you are not reading
anyone else’s theories. Even the learned people, believers
of Kabir's Ideology, living at Lahartara (Kabir Sahib’s
birth place), are reading my books. I am not boasting.
_Kabir Eko Jania, To Jana Sab Jan.
Kabir Ek Na Jania, To Jana Jan Ajan.
Kabir sahib is saying that you are knowledgeable if you have
the knowledge of your soul. And if you do not possess the
knowledge of your soul, all your knowledge is useless_
Everyone in the world, who is reading Sahib’s
literature, is trying to comprehend it in their own way. I
am giving you pure things. There is no adulteration
anywhere.
A man was following a different sect for the last
20years. One day he called me up and said, “I have some
doubts.” I said, “Go ahead ask.” He said, “First of all, I
spoke to Laxman Bajaj at Bhopal, but my doubts could
not be cleared. Then I rang up some other disciples of
yours, but nobody could clear them.” The reality was that
he had a lot of experience. Nobody was able to clear his
doubts properly. He said, “I wanted to take the holy Name
(Initiation-Diksha) from you. The reason is that I have
taken holy Name from another sect (panth) but I am not
satisfied. I have faith in Kabir Sahibji. Today, there are a
lot of people, who are taking references from Sahibji’s
literature. I have searched the whole of India, but there are
lots of contradictions in their words. They are even talking
about Satlok (the abode of Supreme Lord), but end up
worshipping Niranjan.” I asked, “How did you like my


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 45
philosophy? He said, “All those, who speak about Sahibji,
stand nowhere in your comparison. I shall tell you about
the Guru who has Initiated me and about the holy Name,
which he gave me. I have accepted you as my Guru from
the core of my heart. They give this mantra ‘Om-tat-sat’ I
asked my Guru why do you worship Niranjan. My Guru
said the whole world is of Niranjan. The universe is of
Niranjan. Therefore by opposing Niranjan, you cannot get
salvation.”
I asked him what do you mean by Om? He replied Tri-
dev i.e. Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh (the three Hindu
Gods). Then I asked what do you mean by the word ‘Tat’
and he replied Niranjan. I further asked what do you mean
by ‘Sat’? And he replied – the Supreme Lord (Param
Purush).
He further said, “You have stunned me by telling that
‘Om’ is Niranjan. You are boycotting Niranjan. Then my
Guru is a family man. This fact had been disturbing me
even earlier. Your words are unique.” Later he took the
holy Name from me. He convinced his wife and children
also. At the time of their Naam Dhaan, he asked some
more questions. He had some more doubts. I asked, “Are
you the same person?” He said, “Yes, I am the same
person. You are telling with authority that the truth lies
beyond Niranjan. What is that truth? How can I reach
there?”
I told him, for the first time Kabir Sahib brought the
holy Name in this world. In the present era/Kaliyug, He
revealed great secrets to his disciple- Dharamdas.
Dharamdas very humbly requested Sahib.
_Dharmdas Uth Vinati Kinha, Tumhari Daya Paryo Sab
Chinhan.
Apano Bhed Kahon Vilchhani, Jate Parai Daras Pahichani.
Wahai Shabda Guru Kaho Prakasha, Jamen Havai Sukrat Ko

46 Sahib Bandgi
_Wahi Shabda Mein Darshan Hoyee, Bhinna Bhinna Mohin
Kaho Biloyee._
Dharamdas is requesting him to tell about himself. Sahib
is saying-
_Dharmdas Tum Vinati Kinha. Hamro Roop Na Kahu Chinha.
Amar Bhed Asthal Kai Manhin, Jo Pawe Asthir Man Tahin.
Gagan Dharani Utapati Sab Nira, Kaya Bir Su Nam Kabira._
Sahibji is saying that nobody knows about me.
‘KABIR’ or ‘KAYA-BIR’. This means that the one, who
does not possess the mortal body, is ‘KABIR’.
_Nam Hamara Muktamani, Purush Apahi Bhakhi.
Shabda Shiromani Sar Yeh, Hans Sada Chit Rakhi._
He is saying that his name is ‘MUKTA MANI’ and
Supreme Lord has said this Himself. This holy Name
(Saar Naam) is the best of all the names and Hansas
(people, who have taken this Naam) always keep it in their
hearts.
_Yehi Nam Loke Pahunchavai, Sumirat Nam Purush Kahn
Pawai.
Ab Yah Shabda Kahau Sambhara, Suni Hirdaya Manh Karo

Adi Shabda So Nam Hamara, Jo Bujhe So Utare Para.
Dhanya Bhagya Hansan Ke Kahiye, Joy Yah Nam Mukti Man
Gahiye.
So Karunakar Bahut Aghari, Ek Nam Chit Leya Vichari._
Sahibji is saying that only this holy Naam can carry
hansas to Amar Lok (the abode of Supreme Lord). One,
who remembers this holy Naam, is able to reach the
Supreme Lord. With this Satya Naam, he completely
overcomes his sorrows and struggles and Niranjan repents
on his loss. One, who remembers this holy Naam, gets all


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 47
the happiness. One, who cheats, gets confused and keeps
wandering. This holy Naam (Adi Naam) is my true Naam
and, whoever embraces it and chants it continuously, gets
salvation. The Hansa (the person who chants this
salvation-giving holy Naam) is very fortunate.
_Gyan Sthit Ke Eh Guna, Nam Viveki Payee.
Kahain Kabir Dharmdas Se, Hans Lok Ko Jayee._
O Dharmdas! One who gets this rational Naam (holy
Name), goes to Amar Loka (Supreme Lord’s abode).
_Dharmdas Charan Chit Dharahin, Bar Bar Binwe Anusarahi.
Panji Nam Mohi Kaho Vichari, Jamen Hoye Hans Nistari.
Bin Panji Kaha Jane Bheda, Panji Nam Guru Kahi Na Kheda._
Praying repeatedly, Dharmadas requests Sahib to tell
him about this holy Naam, which gives salvation to
Hansas so that his Hansa could also get the benefit.
_Dharmadas Bhal Kinha Vichara, Hansraj Bar Bhag Tumhara.
Nam Sindhu Payo Tum Jabahi, Panji Nirbhay Pahunche
Tabahi.
Bin Nirbhay Koyi Bhed Na Pawe. Bina Bhed Kaise Pahichane.
Ab Suniye Panji Ke Dwara, Ta Charhi Hans Uteri Hai Para.
Ek Nam Ek Chit Ho Dekha, Tahan Hansa Sukh Sagar Pekha.
Panji Adbhut Kahon Sumara, Tate Hoya Mukti Byohara_**.**
Sahib says, “O Hansraj Dharmdas! You will become
fearless, when you get this holy Naam (i.e. when you get
initiated). Without becoming fearless, you cannot know
the secret. With Guru’s grace only, the Hansa can reach
the Supreme Lord’s abode. Then Hansa can cross this
mortal worldly ocean. This is the unique holy Naam,
which gives Param moksh.
Sahib is again telling Dharmdas-
_Tab Nahin Hatey Kurma Nahin Kama, Adi Purush Kinho Nij
Nama.
Nam Sar Hansa Jehi Pawa, Wo Jan Char Kal Pahunchawa.
Pahunchawat Mein Kachhu Dil Mora, Wari Langhi Sakai Na
Chora.
Jo Bole To Shir Chhin Jayee, Khoot Gahe To Anga Nasayee._


48 Sahib Bandgi
_Sar Nam Satguru Ne Dinha, Tate Dharm Shish Per Linha.

Much before, when Kurm and Kaam were not there, the
Supreme Lord expressed His Naam, which was the
Supreme Lord Himself. Kaal allows only that person to
reach AmarLok after crossing him, who has got this holy
Naam. If he does not do so, he will not be able to cross
even the water himself. If he lifts his head to speak
something, he will lose his head. If he tries to catch the
jivas (beings), he will lose his body. This holy Naam is
given by Satguru only. Only due to this, Niranjan allows
the jiva to step on his head. One, who gets this holy Naam,
does not fear Niranjan (Kaal).With the grace of the holy
Naam, Kaal runs away and Hansa (one, who gets this holy
Name), goes to Amar Loka.
Due to this reason I have repeatedly said that Satguru’s
help is required for salvation. This element in the form of
holy Naam is found in Satguru’s concentration.
_Paras Surati Sant Ke Pasa._
Satguru gives this Holy Naam with Paras Surati/Paras
Concentration (paras is the philosopher’s stone). This holy
Naam cannot be expressed in words. In this manner, the
Satguru gives his disciple, the Supreme Lord himself. That
holy Naam alone gives the salvation.
That man said, “First my guru told me to chant ‘Om’.
When I would ask him about the next step, he would tell
me to keep doing this for now and that he would tell other


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 49
things later on.” He further said, “He also enquired from
the elderly ones who were associated with the guru for a
longer time, but even they did not know. My search was
on. Then it appeared to me that all this was incorrect.”
If you do not clear all the doubts of someone
completely, he will never place his trust in you. I have
given the holy Name to almost ten thousand disciples of
other sects (Panths).
What you have to do, is to keep your focus on me. That
is all and you will become fully conscious. Even if you do
not want to meditate, don’t! But then don’t move
according to your mind. It's like saying that if you do not
want to go to school, don’t go, but then, don’t move
around in the company of bad boys.
_Sumiran Man Ki Riti Hai, Bhave Jahan Lagaye.
Bhave Guru Ki Bhakti Kar, Bhave Vishaya Kamaye.
Kabir sahib is saying that mind has a tendency to ponder. You
may either keep it focused on your guru or you may let it
wander in the worldly affairs._
So I told that old lady, who was talking about pure
mind, that the mind can never become pure. It has to be
controlled. It is not something that can be purified.
I want you to keep you focused on me alone. The whole
game is of concentration. Concentration is the greatest
Mantra. So control it!
_Jo Kuchh Hai So Surati Hai, Tahin Kahun Samujhaye._
What is this concentration? This concentration is a
special thing. Sahib has spoken in great detail about it.
_Andhi Surati Naam Bin Jano._
Without the holy Name, our concentration is blind. It is
blunt without the holy Name, just as a knife becomes blunt on
prolonged use; similarly the concentration becomes blunt
due to the prolonged influence of the mind. Therefore
Sahib says in his words-
_Jo Kuchh Hai So Suati Hai._


50 Sahib Bandgi
_Kabir sahib says that everything around us is due to the
concentration_
The 11th Aperture-Door is also within concentration.
I am not contradicting any theory or any ideology. I am
not telling you to concentrate on the holy words (Surati-
shabda-abhyas). This is also not a perfect theory; rather it
is a confused one, because Sahib has never called these
sounds emanating within us as Supreme Lord. How much
consciousness will they create? That is why others are
citing the references of Sahib.
_Uth Jag Ri Mori Surati Suhagin Jag Ri.
Jagu Jatan Kari Achal Ratan Dhan, Guru Ke Charan Chit
Lagu Ri.
Kya Padi Sowo Moh Khoh Mein, Uthi Ke Bhajan Mein Lagu
Ri.
Sowat Tohi Bahut Din Bite, Ka Tori Moothi Mein Lagu Ri.
Dowoo Kar Jori Shish Dhari Charanan, Bhakti Amar War
Mangu Ri.
De Chit Shabda Suno Duno Shrawanan, Uthat Madhur Dhun
Ragu Ri.
Kahat Kabir Suno Bhayee Sadho, Jagat Pith De Bhagu Ri._
It's true! Sounds are emanating within us. Yes, of
course, Kabir Sahib has said this, but haven’t you heard
this -
_Jaap Mare Ajapaa Mare, Anahad Bhi Mar Jaye.
Surati Samani Shabda Mein, Usko Kal Na Khaye.
Kabir Sahib says whether you chant some holy words or focus
on any point within your body (chakras or energy centres) or
focus on the sounds emanating within the body all will end at
the time of your death. If you concentrate on the holy Name
Kaal or Niranjan cannot touch you_
These sounds are coming from Shushumna nerve.
Beyond a point, they cease to exist. That is why I am
talking of **Surati-Yog** only. There is a big difference. My
principles appear to be matching with those of others, but
this is not so. In reality, we are different from all others. I


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 51
have earlier too cited this example of a man, who asked
me once, “On one hand, you say that we don’t have to
make any efforts and on the other hand, you ask us to
concentrate, why this contradiction?”
I said, “Alright, henceforth if you wish, don’t meditate.
You may stop it, but then the condition is that you stop all
the activities of your mind and stop your imagination too.”
_Kabir Maan To Ek Hai, Bhave Jahan Lagaye.
Bhave Guru Ki Bhakti Kar, Bhave Vishaya Kamaye._
Alright, don’t sing hymns and don’t meditate. Don’t do
both of these. However on condition that you will stop
your Thoughts also, which is not possible, because-
_Sumiran Maan Ki Riti Hai, Bhave Jahan Lagaye.
Bhave Guru Ki Bhakti Kar, Bhave Vishaya Kamaye._
If you are not focusing your attention on your Guru,
you Mind will be wandering here and there imagining
something. Then for those moments you become one with
your Mind.
Sahib has emphasized and elucidated the greatness of
chanting (recitation of Gurumantra mentally). Some
people of other ideologies come to me to discuss about
Sushmna. I ask them to explain about the importance of
chanting, in a scientific manner. I ask them the reason
behind accepting the sadhana that chanting is blissful, that
chanting gives us divine experience. Consciousness starts
from the Shushumna nerve. It moves down through spinal
cord to hips and below it up to legs. In the upper portion
of the body, it goes up to Shushumna (Bunknal) passing
through both nasal passages (Ida-pingla nerves).
When somebody starts meditating, the Shushumna
becomes active. And the overall consciousness in the body
increases. In fact, meditation is the way to awaken
Shushumna. Just like when you turn the volume dial on
your music-system, the sound from the deck starts to
increase. Likewise, you have to move the switch of your


52 Sahib Bandgi
breath upwards for Shushumna to be opened. When
Shushumna opens, consciousness of the body increases.
Sometimes, the transformers are installed in an appliance.
If the incoming voltage is low, the switch on the stabilizer
is flipped one step forward, and the voltage increases. Just
as, turning one step up, the flow of current is increased, in
the same way; the activation of Shushumna automatically
increases the consciousness of the body. At that time, our
body becomes fully awakened. It affects the nervous
system. As a result, all the cells in the nervous system are
awakened. They make the entire body supremely
conscious.
At the time of delivery, the doctors inject anesthesia in
the spinal cord. If it is pricked at a wrong point, the nerves
of the lower part of the body may develop defect and
might stop working. Our mind sends the message to all the
parts of the body through Shushumna.
Most of the Sants did not go to the school for formal
education. Then, how could they have such incredible
experiences? Where did they get such wealth of
knowledge? All this was possible due to the increase in
the degree of their consciousness. After reaching that level
of consciousness, we too, can understand all the situations
correctly.
Our consciousness rises with breath and increases
when it enters Shushumna.
_Shukhaman Madhye Base Niranjan, Munda Daswan Dwara.
Uske Upar Maker Tar Hai, Charho Sambhar Sambhara.
Kabir sahib says that Niranjan lives inside our Sushmna nerve
and has plugged it, in order to prevent us from exiting our
body from this aperture/tenth aperture. If we manage to enter
Sushumna, then our mind/Niranjan makes all efforts to distract
us from our path and thus we need to be very cautious just like
a spider is in its web_
Sometimes, you think that the brain is the main
controller of the body, but believe me that it is also


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 53
controlled by someone else. Our brain is the minister and
the mind is the King of the body. When a thought occurs,
it appears that it is originating in our brain. In reality, our
brain is a servant of the Mind. It is only a follower.
Suppose, the mind tells you to visit Srinagar. It will
send the message to the brain through subtle waves via
Shushumna nerve. Then, this message reaches the brain in
a subtle way. Now, the brain decides further action. Thus
the file reaches the brain and it starts planning. Even the
scientists have accepted the brain as the centre of every
activity, but they could not understand that the origin of
the desires and imaginations is somewhere else.
_Maan Tarang Mein Jagat Bhulana._
The whole world is lost in the subtle waves of the
mind. An engineer met with an accident in his car. He was
jolted. Now his neck is active, but other parts of the body
are inactive. It is due to some injury in a nerve.
Sometimes, we see that due to a severe jerk, someone’s
legs stop working. This is due to some defects developed
in the nervous system. And he can perform his activities
only in the sitting position.
Likewise, when Shushumna becomes active, the
consciousness increases manifold in the body. The
consciousness increases a thousand times from the normal
state. Sahib is saying-
_Ida-Pingala, Sukhman Sam Kare, Ardh Aur Urdhwa Bich
Dhyan Lawe.
Kahain Kabir So Sant Nirbhaya Huwa, Janam Aur Maran Ka
Bharm Bhane._
The soul is sitting in the Agya Chakra (one of the seven
Chakras of the body) in the centre of the forehead. It
spreads in the body through Ingla-pingla nerve (the two
nasal passages). When the soul tries to escape by moving
upwards, the mind obstructs its path in a very peculiar
way. It (mind) is not hitting with stones. Sahib has said-


54 Sahib Bandgi
_Sukhman Madhye Basey Niranjan, Mundha Daswan Dwara.
Uske Upar Makar Tar Hai, Chalo Sambhar Sambhara_
There the Mind has closed the 10th Aperture.
_Kitne Tapsi Tap Kar Dare, Kaya Dari Gara.
Grah Chhod Bhaye Sanyasi, Tayu Na Pawat Para._
That is why a person who meditates has his Ingla-
pingla nerves naturally merged. All others, despite their
best efforts to do penance, will not get this position,
because the mind pushes them back into the world. At that
time, it so happens that even if you want to sit for
meditation, it does not allow you to do so. It has applied
the brakes. It is not even visible. In a nutshell, the man is
not able to understand the facts of the inner world. The
Shushumna Nerve opens with concentration only. Sahib is
saying- _Surati Ke Dand Se, Gher Man Pawan Ko.
Kabir sahib is saying that the mind and the breath in the body
are to be controlled with the guiding stick of concentration._
How to control? While guiding the animals to our
desired direction they are surrounded from all sides. If a
cow wants to go in a different direction, it cannot,
because, one man is controlling on one side and the other
man on the other side. Now the cow is forced to move
straight. Gentlemen! Similarly you also have to corner the
mind and breath by the guiding stick of concentration.
Then -
_Pher Ulta Chale.
Kabir sahib says the breath will start moving in the opposite
direction_
The breath is naturally coming to navel through Ingla-
pingla nerve (nasal passages). Just as the wire of the sound
system has been joined to the microphone in a certain
way, similarly, there is a system of breathing in our body.
Sometimes the Ida nerve is open and at other times, Pingla
nerve. If they open simultaneously, they will heat up
together. When one nerve opens, the other takes rest. The
breath, inhaled by Ida-pingla is going directly to the navel.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 55
When the breath reaches the navel, the body is activated
by the oxygen inhaled with the breath. After reaching
there, the breath transforms into Prana (the life-force).
There is a system for this conversion. Just as an electric
meter is installed in your house, from which, one line is
drawn to the fan and it rotates when switched on while
another line from the same meter is drawn to the electric
bulb and it glows, when switched on. Likewise, in your
navel area, there are numerous systems. The air is refined
here. Then it changes into ten different forms called
pranas (life-force). Just as the sugarcane reaches the mill,
where it is used in several ways, e. g. wine is produced;
sugar is manufactured and paper etc, are manufactured.
All these products are very useful, as we all know. In the
same way, when the breath reaches navel, the breath
converts into ten different forms--Apan, Udan, Pran,
Saman, Sarvatan Vyan, Nag, Dhananjay, Kirkil, Jamhai
(yawning) and Devdatta. The Apan is in the rectal area. Its
job is to expel the excreta from the body.
If there is some problem in it, you will feel uneasiness.
Udan is in the lever and its job is to prevent the Apan from
coming upwards. So the duty of Udan is to keep the Apan
under control. The third is Pran. It lives in the heart. The
heart is pumping due to it. The fourth is Saman. It lives in
the joints. Due to this, we are able to fold our legs, arms
and fingers etc. The arms of the dead body will not fold,
because, Saman has escaped from the dead body. All this
is the game of air (vayu). Sarvatan Vyan is spread out in
the entire body. It prevents the body from becoming
bloated. A few hours after the death, the body starts
bloating because, this air escapes. So obesity is the gas
trouble. Dhanjay is in the arms and the chest. It gives
strength to do the physical work. We are able to do every
physical work due to this. In this way the consciousness is
spread in the whole body. Nag vayu is in the neck region.


56 Sahib Bandgi
Its job is to make us sleep. Those, who control their
slumber, know how to control this. Kirkil plays an
important role. It is at the tips of the nose. Its job is to
make us sneeze. It prevents all the airs from mixing up.
Thus all this game is of the airs (vayus i. e. pranas).
According to the Hindu scriptures, there are five pranas
and five sub-pranas.
There are four Vedas. Our Hindu culture is based on
these Vedas. These Vedas are—Rig Veda, Sam Veda,
Yajurveda and Atharva Veda. Rig Veda speaks about the
form of the God. It says that that the God is nondoer and
Nirakar (formless). Yajurveda says that the God is in
Saakar form (in a tangible form). It talks of the God in
three forms- Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva. Samveda
establishes Yoga. Atharveda is contradicting the other
three Vedas but has been derived from them. Out of these
four Vedas, six Shashtras were derived. The Nyaya
Shashtra was derived from Rig Veda. It was written by
Gautam Rishi. Gautam Rishi was the maternal-grandfather
of Hanuman and the father of Anjani (Hanuman’s mother).
The second-Mimansa Shashtra was created out of
Yajurveda. It was written by Jamini Rishi. Vedvyas wrote
Vedanta Shashtra deriving it from SamVed. Kapilmuni,
who cursed 60,000 sons of King Sagar to death, has
written Shankhya Shashtra. There are principles of
meditation (Dhyan Sutras) and the knowledge about
different postures of Yoga (Mudras) in it. Patanjali Rishi
derived Yog Shashtra from Atharva Veda and Rishi Kanad
derived Vaishvik Shashtra from Atharva Veda itself.
After this four Up-vedas were derived from Vedas.
First, Ayurveda was written by Dhanvantari Muni. Hence
he came to be known as the Father of Ayurveda. Ayurveda
gives knowledge about the human body, its ailments and
their treatments using medicines derived mostly from
plants. Second, Dhanur Shashtra was written by


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 57
Vishwamittra. He taught lord Ram. The know-how of all
the weapons like how to handle the bow in archery, how to
handle gada, how to use spear (barchhi) while holding it in
one’s hands etc. are contained in this Shashtra.Third,
Gandharva Shashtra was written by Bhartrahari. There are
six ragas and 36 raginis and the art of singing each is
described in it. Just as, in a cosmetic goods’ shop, all the
cosmetics and adornments are available for sale.
Similarly all the materials related to different art
tecniques, are available in this Shashtra. Again there is
Arth Shashtra, which contains the knowledge about trade
and different climatic conditions relating to different
crops’ production. Which crop will be produced in which
month, when and what has to be sown etc. etc. are
properly described in this Shashtra. These days, whatever
is taught in BCA and MBA etc. in described in this.
So, there are five Pranas and five Up-pranas. In this
way there are ten Pranas. The Kirkil vayu is in the nose. It
keeps all the vayus properly balanced in the body. It
relaxes our body. If this becomes defective, a person will
develop mental disorder.
The thirst is quenched with the water alone. There are
other liquids also which we can drink. There is milk.
There are other juices, but why is thirst not quenched with
these? We drink the water throughout our life and use it
throughout our life for other purposes also, but we do not
know why? The man passes the whole of his life in this
body, but is unable to understand its temperament. Why
the thirst is not quenched, if you drink juice? Why is it not
quenched with drinking Coca-Cola or other drinks? The
water content is also in them, but what is the reason that
the thirst is quenched with water only? In fact, your whole
body is working. The milk has its own natural warmth.
The fruits, from which we extract the juice, also have their
natural warmth. This warmth is also getting passed on to


58 Sahib Bandgi
our body, when we consume them. The fact is that both,
the body as well as the water is naturally cool. It is this
cool nature of the water that quenches your thirst.
I always talk to the point. Nothing else is as cool as
water. One day, I started from Ranjadi Ashram after
having my food. I felt thirsty. I ate some fruits in the car. I
even took a glass of milk at the Satsang venue, but my
thirst was not quenched. My throat was parched. After
sometime, a person gave me a glass of water. Then my
thirst was quenched. Why? This is so because the water
provided me the cool feeling that I needed.
Even if, somebody offers me thousand rupees for
having a soft drink, I will not have it. I never take
refrigerated water. I avoid staying in air-conditioned
rooms. In olden days, the houses were built of mud. The
walls were made thick. So they were naturally air-
conditioned. Twenty seven lakh different types of
creatures are living under the earth, but the man is unable
to realize the reason behind this. The ants are living below
the ground in order to save themselves from the cold. It is
the nature of the earth that it becomes warm during the
winter and cold during the summer. The water in the well
is cold during the summer. The earth (soil) automatically
goes against the weather conditions in order to keep itself
safe. Why is paddy sown during the months of June-July,
even when it requires cooler temperature to grow? In
those months it is extremely hot. The fact is that the lower
temperature, required, is available in the earth. The wheat
requires a little warmth. That is why it is sown during the
months of Oct. and Nov. (Kartik- Hindi month), because,
at that time the earth is warm. The earth’s temperament is
just the opposite of the temperature of the air around it.
Why do vapors come out of our mouth during the
winter season despite feeling so cold when we have to
wear a coat or a sweater? In fact there is earth element in


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 59
our body also and it (earth) is showing its characteristics
there. Don’t eat very hot things during winter and very
cold things during summer. Always keep a balance. Why?
I’ll explain. Your body is warm during the winter, but
people do not know this. It is very harmful because of the
earth element. During the summer season you will find
that your waist and your throat are cool because there is
earth element inside your body. That is why our ancestors
were building those thick mud walls.
_Yeh Kaya Hai Samarath Keri, Kaya Ki Gati Kahu Na Heri.
Kabir Kaya Athah Hai, Koyee Birla Jane Bhed.
Kabir sahib is saying that this human form of ours is capable
of doing innumerable wonders, but no one besides the Satguru
knows it._ Only a very few people know all this.
So I was telling that various functions of our body are
the game of wind. The role of Devdatta vayu is to move
the eye-lids. Brahmanand Ji has said in the following lines
that the human body which has made this universe lively
is nothing but a house/hut made of mud -
_Admi Ka Jism Kya Hai, Jis Par Saila Hai Jahan.
Ek Mitti Ki Imarat, Ek Mitti Ka Makan._
Ninety percent of the body is made of earth element.
There is harmony between water and earth. He adds
further - _Khoon Ka Gara Hai Isme, Eint Iski Haddiyan.
Chand Swason Pe Khada Hai, Aye Khayale Aasman.
Maut Ki Purjor Andhi, Aake Jab Takarayegi.
Toot Kar Yeh Imarat, Khak Mein Mil Jayegi.
Brahmanandji adds that the human body is like a house made
of mud, which has bones as its bricks joined together by
cement of blood. The entire contraption is standing on the base
of a few breaths. All this will be razed to the ground by the
storm of death one day_
Every breath that goes without chanting the Supreme
Lord’s name is a waste. Every breath, that reaches the
navel, is reducing your life. Just like every time the torch
is lit, its battery life is reduced. The vehicle consumes the


60 Sahib Bandgi
fuel and releases exhaust gases. In the same way, we are
breathing. After reaching the navel, the breath is
consumed and byproducts such as carbon-di-oxide and
water vapour are exhaled. The fuel too gets consumed and
is released as exhaust gases. This affects the engine.
Similarly with the intake of every breath, the body is
getting affected. This breath is operating all the organs of
the body. Whoever saves it, gets longevity. When
Shushumna Nerve gets activated, the entire body gets
ceased. Thus the energy is saved and you really feel
relaxed and happy.
Even in your dreams you face problems. You face
difficult situations and sometimes do wrong things. There
also the Mind is active, but in meditation the disturbances
created by Mind, are stopped. When you are fully
concentrated, you get the true pleasure. That is why, Sahib
says- _Jap, Tap, Sanyam, Sadhana, Sab Sumiran Ke Mahin.
Kabir Janat Sant Jan, Sumiran Sam Kachhu Nahin._
Meditation gives real joy. Therefore whenever you are
meditating, you get relieved of your troubles. Nanak Dev
has also said- _Sakal Rog Ki Aushadhi Naam.
Chanting the Supreme Lord’s name is a panacea for all ills_
Can we ascertain it scientifically? Goswamiji is saying-
_Nase Rog Hare Sab Pida.
Chanting the Supreme Lord’s name cures all ills and pains_
Sahib is also saying-
_Sabahin Rasayan Main Kiya, Nahin Nam Sam Koye.
I have tried doing so many things but there is nothing like
chanting the Supreme Lord’s name_
Why? Can we prove it scientifically? Certainly. When
Shushumna is active, our energy is conserved. When this
happens, our consciousness increases. This gives extra
energy to the body that has the power to heal the diseases
of your body. This can be explained scientifically also. At
that time, you are not doing any physical activity but the


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 61
Mind remains active. Although the physical body is not
active even while we are sleeping, but the deeper inner
cells keep working, rather they do more work.
One man said, “I become angry in my dreams. I start
beating also. After that I want to run away. I see some odd
dreams.” I told him to go to sleep after chanting the holy
Name. The dream is also based on your thoughts. For
example, if you feel thirsty at the time of going to sleep,
you will keep on searching for water during the dreams. If
you have an urge to urinate and you are too lazy to go the
toilet before going to bed, you will search for the toilet
throughout the night in your dreams and sometimes you
may urinate on the bed itself. It is due to the fact that your
internal cells (in the brain) remain active while the outer
cells (the physical body) are inactive. You can run into
troubles in your dream. You can even plan many things.
Many grown-up people come and tell me that they
sometimes urinate in the bed while sleeping. It is because,
after entering the stage of deep slumber, concentration
becomes blunt.
Therefore in this way we enter Shushmna. Once you
get an entry into Shushumna, your concentration becomes
extremely awakened. It increases a thousand times. In its
present state too it is showing its wonders. Even when, the
mobile is switched off, time function continues to work. It
has been designed internally in such a way that the time
function does not stop working, even when the mobile is
switched off. Likewise Shushuna Nerve also remains
active to some extent. So, even though it is not fully
active, it is still working. But when it becomes fully
active, it is incredible.
_Kyon Bhatakata Phir Raha Hai, Tu Talashe Yar Mein.
Rasta Shaharag Mein Hai Dilver Pe Jane Ke Liye.
(Why are you trying to seach the Supreme Lord in the outside
world? The path to reach him is through the Sushumna nerve)_


62 Sahib Bandgi
Is Sushumna supreme? No, it is a position. It is a means
to enter the inner world. If you want to go on a voyage,
you have to reach the harbour by any mode of conveyance
like bus, car or scooter. Then you board on the ship. In the
same way, Shushumna helps us to get closer to the God. It
is the medium to reach him. Gurunanak Dev has said—
_Ida, Pingla, Sukhman Bujhe, Ape Alakh Lakhave.
Uske Upar Sancha Satguru, Anahad Surati Shabda Samave.
Dhun Baje Ghora, Magan Bhaya Maan Mora.
Shabdai Mara Mar Gaya, Ab Marahun Na Duji Bar.
Shabda Te Payiye Nanka, Guru Shabda Laga Pyar.
Through Ida, Pingla and Sushumna nerve I moved my
concentration upwards. Here I could hear enrapturing music
inside me but I kept on moving up slowly and reached my
Supreme lord_
First we have to start moving into it, just as the babies
are first taught in a kindergarten school. There they are
taught with the help of the toys. The numbers-one, two,
three etc. are taught with the help of colourful balls and
this way he starts learning. In the same way Shushumna
Nerve aids, but you must not get entangled in it. Through
this concentration you become focused. So the
concentration is awakened. Awakening happens, when you
become fully focused.
Wise people colour the interior walls of their houses in
colours that reflect the light making the room well lit,
because such colours reflect light. Likewise Shushumna
Nerve illuminates the concentration. On reaching there,
the consciousness gets better. The grey colour does not
illuminate but cream or any other light colour reflects the
light and illuminates the room. We wear clothes according
to our body-type. The colour reflects on our body. In the
same way, Shushumna Nerve is such that the
consciousness gets heightened. If we go further, the state
of consciousness changes its form. Sahib has presented the
pure spiritualism to us, but the people could not


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 63
understand it. So they started comprehending it
differently.
He has spoken correctly, but our mind with its limited
capabilities could not understand it. One man came to me
to fix an auspicious date for marriage. I asked, “In which
month, do you want?” He said, “Nanamber.” I said,
“There is no month like this. It must be November.” One
man said, “The medicine has given me ARMAN.” I said,
“You got ‘aram’ (relief) and not ‘arman’. ‘Arman’ and
Aram are two different words.” I understand all the
languages. I have studied Sanskrit also. I asked one man,
“What is the meaning of the word ‘santape’ mentioned in
Poem ‘Guru Nanak Santape’?” He said that it is the word
in Dongari language. I told him that it is the word in
Sanskrit language. I mean to say that those who
comprehend Sahib’s literature differently have
misunderstood it.
Therefore-
_Atam Mein Paratam Darshe, Parmatam Mein Jhayeen.
Jhayeen Bich Sayeen Darshe, Lakhe Kabira Sayeen.
Kabir sahib is saying that one can find the supreme lord within
ourselves, in our soul_
When the concentration goes beyond everything i.e.
beyond mind, brain, memory and pride, and when it’s not
engaged in desires or their derivatives, you will get the
realization of the Supreme Lord very easily. However the
mind puts hurdles in this. It entangles the soul and the
concentration in some or the other thoughts. This is a very
subtle fact.
I am telling you the facts after going so deep into the
subject that it is very difficult to explain any further. I
have explained it to you earlier and you have understood
it, but you cannot speak those facts in your own words.
You keep fumbling for words to express yourself. I tell
those facts quite simply.


64 Sahib Bandgi
Some innocent ladies also attend my discourses. They
say, “We do not want anything more than what we are
getting.” I asked an old lady some question during the
discourse. She could not reply. I asked her, “Don’t you
listen to my discourse?” Her reply was technically
correct. I asked her, “Were you sleeping?” She said,
“No.” I further asked, “You have been coming here since
long. Don’t you listen to; _Dhyan Moolam Guru Rupam_**.**
_Vedas are mentioning that your concentration must be centered
on your Guru_
Sahib has said- _Mool Kabir Gahi Chale, Kul Khele Sansar._
Therefore, I was saying, “When concentration is
awakened, it reaches a state, where there is no Mind, no
memory. Then the God himself enlightens you. When the
man reaches this state, he experiences very subtle things.
_Puhup Vas Se Patla, Pani Se Ati Jheen.
Vayu Se Utawala, Dost Kabira Keen._
He is thinner than the scent of the flowers, subtler than
the flow of the water and faster than the speed of the air.
Such is the friend of Kabir (the Supreme lord). He is
beyond the reach of our senses (Indriyas) i.e. He cannot be
known by our senses. He is beyond the limits of sky. He is
beyond all colours and forms. He cannot be described in
words. He is beyond the speech and is independent i.e. He
is not dependent on anything and self contained.
Even the soul is beyond the reach of our senses. It
(soul) can be experienced spiritually only. At the time of
its realization, there is no contribution of our senses or any
part of our body or any other element.
At that time, the Supreme Lord Himself enlightens our
soul. Therefore- _Atam Mein Parmatam Darshe._
Hence it is a matter of concern that we are being
directed by our mind on every matter. The experiences of
thoughts, after thoughts, pleasures and sorrows are solely


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 65
of our Mind. Our soul is beyond the reach of all these.
Sahib is saying-
_Teen Lok Mein Manahi Viraji, Tahi Na Chinhat Pandit Kazi.
(Kabir sahib is saying that nobody has been able to
comprehend the role of mind in this universe be it learned
Hindus or Muslims or anyone else)_
The whole game is that of mind only.
_Kahat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Jagat Bana Hai Man Se.
He adds that this world is nothing but the manifestation of our
mind_
The forces inside the man are very strong. The holy
Name reduces the power of these forces.
The moment, the soul is separated from these elements;
realization of the soul automatically starts. Oh! The body
and the mind both are the hindrances. Both these are the
mind itself.
_Dev Nirnjan Sakal Sharira, Tame Bhrami Bhrami Rahe
Harira.
Kabir sahib is saying that Niranjan/our mind keeps us
occupied and entangled in this physical body._
Sahib has reprised both of these.
_Yeh Tan Vish Ki Belari, Guru Amrat Ki Khan.
Shish Diye Jo Guru Mile, To Bhi Sasta Jan.
Kabir sahib says that our body is full of dirt while our guru is
full of holy nectar. Even if we have to behead ourself to get the
love of our guru, we must consider it to be a fair deal_
Sahib explains again-
_Hansa Tu To Sabal Tha, Atpat Teri Chal.
Rang Kurang Te Rang Liya, Ab Kyon Phirat Behal.
He is addressing the soul as a swan and saying that it was very
capable and very powerful in itself, but has lost its sheen
because it regards itself as the body being under the influence
of the Mind_
Therefore, Sahib is saying that without thru holy Naam,
the concentration is directionless. It is in the sorry state
after getting entangled with mind and body. Therefore-
_Surati Samhale Kaj Hai, Tu Mat Bharam Bhulaye._


66 Sahib Bandgi
_Man Sayyad Manasa Lahar, Bahat Katahun Na Jaye._
Don’t get entangled anywhere. If you are listening to
inner sounds (Anahad Dhunen), you will become one with
them. They are also a part of Niranjan.
_So Satguru Mohin Bhave, Jo Aawaa Gaman Mitave.
Ankh Na Munde, Kan Na Rundhe, Nahin Anhad Arujhave_**.**
_Kabir sahib says that he likes the guru who is capable of
giving him salvation without his own efforts like practicing
difficult postures of meditation where he has to close his eyes,
ears or focus on inner sounds_
In fact, in the process of Initiation (Naam-Diksha) the
guru activates the soul itself.
_Janam Janam Ka Masakala, Pal Mein Dare Dhoye.
At the time of Initiation/Naamdaan, guru removes all the rust
and the dirt which has accumulated in our soul over several
births_
He brings about changes in it (concentration).
_Uth Jag Ree Mori Surati Suhagin Jag Ree.
Kya Tu Soye Moh Nishi Mein, Uth Ke Bhajan Mein Lagu Ree.
Here concentration/Surati is being addressed as a bride who is
sleeping. Kabir sahib is telling the bride to get up and start
chanting the holy name_
It (concentration) reaches the state where it loses
contact with the body.
_Jap, Tap, Sanyam, Sadhana, Sab Sumiran Ke Manhi.
Kabir Janat Sant Jan, Sumiran Sam Kachhu Nahin.
Kabir sahib says that all the efforts which common people
make to pray are all included in chanting the holy Naam
inaudibly (sumiran).And that all the Sants know the fact that
there is no comparison of sumiran_
Sahib says- _Tharhe, Baithe, Pade, Utane, Kahain Kabir Ham
Wahi Thikane.
Kabir sahib says that he keeps his attention focussed on his
Satguru whether he is sleeping or awake, standing or sitting or
doing just anything_
Sahib resides in concentration. So, if this can be
controlled, you will get salvation.

#### Devotion Teaches The Art Of Living

Some people are teaching the art of living in the world.
Our parents teach us too how to live and how to lead the
life. On the other hand, in my opinion it is more important
to know how to leave this world. When a man learns the
art of ‘leaving’ the world, he ‘automatically’ will
understand the art of living in the world. Then, he will not
hurt anybody. He will not deceive anyone in his dealings.
In the spiritual field too, we have lots of issues. If true
devotion is practiced, we will automatically learn the art
of living.
_Bhakti Swantatra Sakal Gun Khani, Binu Satsang Na Pawat
Prani.
Goswami Tulasidas in his epic Ramayana says that
bhakti/devotion is a mine full of virtues and that it is possible
to become devoted only after Satsang/religious discourse_
The life-style of our people is great. What a marvelous
behavior they have! We are not killing anybody; we are
not eating meat, nor taking alcohol, no gambling and not
amassing wealth. All this will happen to you, when you
practice devotion.
Then why are the other people opposing us? Why are
they trying to trouble our people? Why are hurdles being
put for us? The first thing is that you should not take
tension from anybody. Man’s level of thinking has gone
down drastically. Just look around in the world, there is
tension amongst real brothers. There is dispute between
husband and wife. Then what to say about the strangers!
This is the bad influence of the current era-Kaliyug. Learn
to live such that even if somebody gives you tension, you
just forget it. Wherever, I hold my discourse, my
opponents focus on trying to create tension for me, but I
stay unaffected. Inculcate these things in yourself.
At Ramkot, one pandit and his wife, both were haunted by
evil spirits. Panditji got several yagnas done. Hawans


68 Sahib Bandgi
(ritual ceremony) were performed. He bowed his head
before several witch doctors, but to no avail. Even after 40
years he did not get any relief. He did not get peace of
mind. Then, he came in contact with one of my trustees-
Chain Singh. He said to him, “Come over and meet
Sahibji once.” Pandit said, “He is a Muslim.” Chain
Singh said, “There is nothing like that. You have been
misguided. At least come and see it yourself.” He came to
me. I said, “First you should establish a relation with us.
Take the holy Name.” He, along with his family, took the
holy Name. Then they were relieved. He wanted to set up
an Ashram at Ramkot and organize my discourses there.
He said, “The people in Ramkot are misguided. You
should start discourses here and provide relief to the
people from superstitions.” Even I wanted this. And I also
knew very well that I had a lot of opposition there. I am
always ready for that. When a boxer learns boxing, he
does not only learn how to punch but also learns to face
his opponent’s punches. I am ready to face all kinds of
behaviour.
Pandit arranged for my discourses with great fervour
and enthusiasm. I reached there. The moment, I raised the
slogan ‘Satguru Dev ki jai’, a lot of noise started coming
from the other side of the road. There was a shopkeeper
facing us. 15-20 anti-social elements also assembled there.
They started shouting and dancing like crazy people. The
Indian style of singing and dancing is superb, but in their
music (Western style), nothing was good. Their music was
as if some plate has fallen from the top of a hill. Their
style of dancing was also very odd. The beauty of our
country’s women is excellent. If you see some English
lady, even if she is beautiful, she will not be very
appealing. In our country, the beauty of our ladies is
execusite. Everything in our country is quite unique.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 69
So, when they started putting obstacles, one man said,
“I will go and ask them to stop it.” I told him, “No, don’t
do this.” They also can say, “This is our program.” I said,
“Let us not fight. Let them do it. How long will they do it?
If somebody gives you tension, don’t become hostile. Go
about it as if nothing has happened. Keep yourself focused
on me. Let the noise be as it is.”
Today, everyone has a motto of giving tension to others.
It is natural. I said, “Don’t say anything.” Gradually my
voice became audible, as they became tired, but kept the
music playing.
“See, if somebody’s house is near the railway track he
gets habituated to the noise of the train passing by. You
also get habituated to this.”
When the discourse was over, there was an arrangement
for an open feast. Panditji had arranged for purries, halwa
and paneer etc. (Indian style dishes). Now those, who
were creating nuisance, stood first in the queue to get the
food. One person, who was distributing the food, came to
me and said, “They have come to take the food. Should I
shun them off?” I said, “No, feed them first. They are not
our opponents. They are not concerned with all this. They
were called by someone else for this purpose.” In our
country, the people become popular very easily. In the
countries like Australia, for popularity people do odd
things knowingly. Here in our country, this is easy.
Criticism spreads like fire.
Even if I build an Ashram in heaven, I know that I shall
be opposed there. One man said, “You will face no
opposition in Punjab.” I said, “It will certainly be there.”
He said, “I shall not let it happen there.” I said, “What can
you do? When I tell people, don’t give donation, there is
bound to be opposition. When I ask my devotees to
abstain from superstition and to be cautious of witch
doctors, there shall definitely be opposition. They shall be


70 Sahib Bandgi
against us. The witch doctors are bound to feel the heat.
They will ensure that the people accept the presence of
ghosts. They have now asking ‘who are these creatures,
who are not accepting us at all’? They are in a big trouble.
When they find that their business is going down, they
start abusing us.” Some sects are becoming jealous of the
progress of our sect. During 1968, our battalion came to
Kulliyan. People were very innocent there. If there was a
marriage ceremony, Jagarata (a religious ceremony where
they sing praises of a Hindu Goddess through the night)
had to done. Satwa and other different kinds of religious
ceremonies came into existence only after 1985. Those,
who died here, are worshipped as Hatya (a local deity).
After 2 to 4 years, they are considered as deities. Our
opponents say that we are blaspheming deities. No! We
are speaking against the practice of keeping mohre
(keeping stone pieces as a symbol of those who passed
away for worshipping them) in the name of these deities.
We are not against Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva etc. i. e. we
are speaking against those mohares so that people do not
get entangled in such superstitions. Some people were not
comfortable with this. We are saying that people should
not believe in superstitions. They are opposing us to the
hilt. Some people are calling us Muslims but we are pure
Hindus. The seven rules which we are telling people to
follow go on to strengthen Hinduism further. Those who
do not follow our seven rules may also like to call
themselves as Hindus, but we do not accept them as pure
Hindus.
One of our Ashrams is at Rajpure. There the people
redefined the boundaries of their land. One of my
disciples said that those people had illegally taken our
land. I said, “This is the newly dug out boundary of the
field.” One man said, “In Jammu & Kashmir the fields are
like this only. They are zig zag.” I asked my disciple,


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 71
“Who is this man?” He told that he has laid the boundary
of his field on the other side. Further a third man has
redefined the boundary of his field on the third side of the
Ashram. A large crowd had gathered there. These people
were saying-
_Nakka Te Makkhi Bain Ni Deni, Sahib Bandgi Rain Ni Deni.
(Just as we won’t allow a fly to sit on our nose, we won’t allow
Sahib Bandgi to remain here.)_
My disciple said-
_Sahib Bandgi Itthe Raine, Tainu Mar Tagri Paini.
Sahib Bandgi will remain here and you will be beaten, if you
do something wrong._
I said, “We have not come here for fight.”
Again, the astrologers are also against us because we
are preaching against astrology. If somebody’s son has
failed in the examination and he wants his son to pass,
they (astrologers) opine that his stars are not favorable or
some planets are against the boy. Oh ho! Neither Rahu
(one of the planets in astrology) has anything against your
son nor Mars or Saturn. Why should they be concerned
with your child’s performance? They are not doing this
work. The fact is that some people are making money
using their names.
Not only this, the behaviour of our people has
automatically become marvelous after taking the holy
Name. Our disciples talked to others and told them, “You
are eating meat, drinking alcohol and go to witch doctors
for treatment. Then what type of spiritualism is this?” At
this they started feeling disturbed. It appeared to them that
they were weak in their arguments. When they compared
themselves with our disciples, they found themselves
lacking from the standards of our disciples. So they started
feeling inferior to our disciples. They started feeling
jealous also and hence started opposing us. In our society
we see that when a girl goes out, some bystanders might


72 Sahib Bandgi
pass lewd remarks but she moves on unaffected, as if
nothing had happened. I also see from a distance, whether
a person, who is watching me, is my disciple or not. If he
happens to be a misbehaved person, I just ignore him and
move on.
So I am not against the idol-worship (Sagun Bhakti). It
is also a level (primary level) of bhakti. Let us see its
achievements. In fact, it is not advocating any wrong path,
but its reach is limited. The preachers of this form of
bhakti are family people. They have given a proper
direction too. Just as we send our children to the
kindergarten where they are trained to become disciplined,
likewise in idol worship, the teacher (guru) is also
teaching the ABC of bhakti. The child’s teacher gives him
a book to read and learn, but he should not to be limited to
that level only. Again just as you have kids, the guru has
them too. His style of living is just like yours. Just as you
have vices in your body (i. e.maya), the guru (teacher) too
has them. Hence he is as much in the clutches of maya as
you are!
_Bandhe Ko Bandha Mila, Chhutey Kaun Upaye.
Sewa Kar Nirbandh Ki, Pal Mein Let Chhudaye.
Kabir sahib asks - how can a person who is tied up himself,
helps another person in bondage? Only when he seeks help
from a person who is free from all bonds can expect to get
released_
They (the gurus teaching Idol Worship) are also
respectful, but they cannot help release your soul. In the
world there are seven gurus for everyone.
_Pratham guru mata pita, raj viraj ke data._
The parents are the first teachers because your body is
formed with their egg and sperm. Hence it is said that we
must obey our parents and our guru.
_Mat pita guru agya maney._


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 73
The mother has brought you up, taught you how to walk.
She is honourable. However she will not be able to help
you cross this worldly-ocean.
_Dusara Guru Garbh Ki Dayee._
The second guru is the lady/midwife who helped you
come out of your mother’s womb very safely at the time
of delivery. Otherwise your shoulders could have got
stuck inside the womb. She gets the child out of womb
very cautiously. She is honourable too!
_Sab Guru Sansar Mein, Apani Apani Thaur._
All the gurus are respectable in their own way.
_Tisara Guru Jin Nam Rakha.
Chauth Guru Jin Vidya Dina._
The third guru gave you the name by which you are
known to the world. The fourth one is that teacher who
imparted the education to you.
_Pancham Guru Sanskar Karayee_**.**
The fifth guru performed various customs and rituals e.
g. ceremony on the occasion of your birth or marriage etc.
He inculcated good habits in you.
_Sixth Guru Jin Nam Lakhaya._
The sixth guru is Kulguru (one, who introduces you to
spritualism). _Satawan Jo Sabse Tor, Ek Se Jori.
Satguru Tisaka Nam._
The seventh guru is one who broke us off from the
entire world and liaison us with one-the Supreme Lord.
Once I had a discourse at a certain place. I was just
about to take my food when my Kulguru arrived. I was
neither Initiated by him nor had I invited him here. He had
come there on his own will. I offered him my seat and
then I offered him the food in the same utensils as mine.
Post this I offered him my bed and I myself lay on the
floor. At last he left the place happy and contented.
So the teacher, who taught us the idol-worship, is also
respectable. No matter how well educated you are, always


74 Sahib Bandgi
honour the elderly. They are more experienced. Beware of
insulting somebody. Do unto others as you want them to
do unto you. Then there will be no issues for dispute.
After Idol worship comes the Formless devotion.
However this is difficult to practice. Like Idol-worship in
this form of devotion too, there shall be rebirth. Sahib has
said regarding this-
_Sidh Sadh Tridevadi, Panch Shabda Mein Atake.
Mudra Sadh Rahe Ghat Bhitar, Fir Aundhe Munha Latake.
Kabir sahib is saying that acomplished Yogis and even the
three Gods-Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva have controlled their
minds and bodies to a great extent. They are practicing five
forms of meditation by focusing on five energy centres inside
the body and are forced to take rebirth in their mother’s womb_
We have something different to tell. We are talking
about the guru’s grace. Braving the illusions of mind and
body, the great rishies, munies, sidhs and sadhaks etc. kept
wandering in the mortal world. Only a true guru (Satguru)
takes you far away from all these entanglements of the
three worlds of mind and body.
The Bhandarin (Bhringa) who transforms another
insect with its sound to another bhranga does so without
killing it. However, when I gave the holy Name to Shiv
Kumar (one of my disciples), I killed his individuality at
that very moment because that was dirty. This is the most
difficult work in the world. It is due to this quality that the
greatness of the guru has been sung.
_Sat Deep Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Bada Na Koye.
Karta Kare Na Kari Sake, Guru Kare So Hoye.
Paras Mein Aru Sant Mein, Tu Bado Antaro Maan.
Wo Loha Kanchan Kare, Guru Kar Le Aap Saman.
Kabir sahib says that Satguru or the true Guru has no equal in
this entire creation! You might try endlessly for salvation but
this will not happen if the Guru doesn’t bestow it on you.
Unlike the philosopher’s stone which can changes iron to gold_


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 75
_only and not into another philosopher’s stone, Guru changes
you and you become just like him_

#### Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru

Is the world in which we all are living, really the world
of Kaal (death)? Contrary to the belief of ordinary people
in the world that they are managed by the power of God,
Sahib bewilders everyone by saying a different thing-
_Yeh Sansar Kaal Ko Desha.
The world in which we are living, is the world of Kaal
Gan Gandharva Rishi Muni Aru Deva, Sab Mil Lag Niranjan
Sewa.
Everyone- gana, gandharv, rishi, munis and the Gods are
devoted to Kal Niranjan.
Brahmadi, Shiv, Sanakadi Aj Sur, Kal Ke Gun Gawahin._
i.e. Brahma, Vishnu, Shiv, Sanakadik and all kinds of
Gods are praising Kaal. Couldn’t even they find the truth?
Yes! That’s the truth.
_Jo Rakchhak Tanh Chinhat Nahin, Jo Bhakchhak Tanh Dhyan
Lagahin._
No one pays attention to the savior. Everybody is busy
praying Kaal. Rishis, Munis, Peers, Pagamber, etc. (all
accomplished religious people), who came before Sahib,
limited themselves to praying Nirnjan only.
_Jaaye Niranjan Manhi Samaye, Aage Ka Koyee Bhed Na Paye.
The farthest, they could reach, is the union with Niranjan.
Nobody knows beyond this._
Now the question arises on the point that during all the
eras, all rishis, munis, sidhs, sadhaks (all types of
renowned and accomplished people who have done
extreme penance) reached Niranjan only and none of them
went beyond. Should we accept these beliefs? First thing
let us see the means and the methods of worship practised
in our country. What means and methods of worship, exist
in our country? Should you believe, whatever I am
telling? Is everyone in the world worshipping Kaal? There


76 Sahib Bandgi
may be some dispute in this. There may be difference of
opinion on this issue in the world, but we have to analyze
the facts. We have to think over this and check which
force has been accepted as the Supreme by the people of
the world. Whom are we worshipping? We need to think
about all these facts honestly and without bias. Expand the
horizon of your thinking. When you become honest, you
will get honest thoughts too. Whenever you are biased, the
thoughts of forgery, frauds and deceiving others engulf
you.
When we think judiciously, we find that these days
mainly two forms of worship are being practised- idol
worship and formless worship. Mostly people worship
five gods-Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh, Adishakti and
formless (Nirakar) Niranjan. The truth is that the people
are worshipping mainly these five gods. Some are
Vaishnavas. They worship Thakurji and idolize Vishnu.
Those, who are worshipping Krishna, are also idolizing
Vishnu. Those, who are worshipping Ram, are also
idolizing Vishnu. Then some are worshiping Shiva and
some Brahma. In what way are they worshipping Brahma?
Brahma is the founder of Vedas. Those who are the
followers of Vedic Ideology are idolizing Brahma. Brahma
is being worshipped in the form of Vedas as well as
Brahmins.
Then there is a difference in the style of their living too.
The followers of Brahma follow Vedic principles and live
according to Vedas. In the Vaishnav-cult, they believe that
Vishnu was its founder. There are differences in their
eating habits too. The people of Shaiv-cult accept Shiva as
founder. There are several devotees of Adi Shakti (mother
goddess) also, but their believers do not follow as much
restrictions as their vaishnav cousins. In vaishnav-cult,
there is more emphasis on what to eat and drink. Then,
there are devotees of formless god (Nirakar-Niranjan). All


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 77
of the above belong to the same family. That is why, it is
said- _Sagun Nirgun Ekai Jano.
Both Idol worship and the formlessworship are the same._
But the people worshipping formless God do not
believe in Idol worship. Former are practicing one of the
five different postures of meditation. If you see these
different ideologies, you will find that there is synchrony
between them. Those, who worship Brahma, worship
Vishnu also and those, who worship Vishnu, worship
Shiva too. Their customs are also quite similar. There is
harmony among all the three ideologies. In several
temples, we find that there is a statue of Brahma, Vishnu
and Shiva along with Hanuman. This way one section of
the society practices Idol worship. We have to think about
the focus area of Idol worship. It is preaching people to do
good deeds, kindness and service to others etc. We are not
criticizing it. Sanatan Ideology (an Ideology believing in
all the three ideologies) is not bad. It is also talking of
good deeds. But the question is what our goal is? By
practicing it we get two types of salvation-Salokya and
Samipya. These take the devotee to Heaven or Pitra-lok,
but unfortunately he does not get immortal state/salvation
in these two. After reaching there are we satisfied? No,
there is no immortal state there. We go there in order to
reap fruits of the good deeds which we have done in this
world. And after enjoying the benefits of these deeds we
have to come back to this world (Mratyu Loka). We are
stating only the facts and nothing else. We are not
criticizing this form of worship. This is what you get as a
result of this worship. This is what the scriptures are
saying too-
_Satguru Vachan Vihansi Kar Bole, Mukti Bhed Kahun Parda
Khole.
Aadihi Purush Niranjan Kinha, Maya Adi Tahi Kah Dinha._


78 Sahib Bandgi
_Tihin Sanyog Bhaye Triya Bari, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh

Sahib says that the Supreme Lord/Param Purush
created Niranjan and after that He created Adi Shakti and
gave her to him. Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva were born out
of their union. They are the king of four types of
salvations, but the fifth type of salvation is beyond them.
The four types of salvations are given by Niranjan, so that
all the creatures remain under his control. However only
the person who gets Initiated with the holy Naam from
Satguru, gets the fifth salvation and goes beyond the rites,
customs, religion, virtues and sins, greed and attachments
etc. and fathoms the worldly ocean forever.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 79

Then how did the Idol worship and Formless worship
start? How did they become so popular? Sahib is saying-
_Sagun Nirgun Aikai Jano._
Idol worship and Formless worship are inter-related.
That is why there is very little friction between the
followers of these two forms of worship. But this is their
matter. This is as normal as the difference of opinion
between the father and son. There are differences amongst
the brothers too. However there is a limit to it.
Now what is Formless devotion? This is quite similar to
Idol worship. That is why Sahib terms them as one and the
same thing. Come, let us analyse these.
_Sagun Bhakti Kare Samsara, Nirgun Yogeshar Anusara._
Idol worship is practised by all the people in the world,
while masters of yoga practice the Formless worship.
Those, practicing formless worship are saying-
_Je Je Drishyam, Te Te Anityam, Je Je Adrishyam, Te Te Nityam._
Whatever is visible, will be destroyed, while whatever
is invisible is the only truth. We sometimes hear that
somebody worships the Formless God. The system of
Formless worship revolves around the five yogic postures.
In principle, these devotees do not worship the external
elements. They opine that everything is inside the body
itself. Now what is this? We have to understand the
fundamentals of Formless worship. Chachari, Bhuchari,
Khechari, Unmuni and Agochari are the five yogic
postures and the followers are guided by their guru to
perfect these postures. Their argument is that the God is
inside our body. The outside elements are perishable.
These five postures are the means to enter the inner-world.
Sahib has said-
_Pratham Puran Purush Puratan, Panch Shabda Uchchara.
Soham, Sat, Jyoti Niranjan Kahiye, Rarankar, Omkara._


80 Sahib Bandgi
First of all the Omnipotent Lord (Niranjan) uttered five
words – Soham, Sat, Jyoti Niranjan, Rarankara, Omkara.
_Shabdahi Sagun, Shabdahi Nirgun, Shabdahi Ved Bakhana.
Shabdahi Puni Kaya Ke Andar, Kar Baitha Asthana.
Jo Jaake Upasana Kina, Usaka Kahun Thikana._
This is said regarding both Idol Worship as well as
formless Worship. Sahib is saying, “I shall tell you where
these (form of worship) will take you.”
Basically in the beginning our forefathers didn’t
practice Idol worship. They were practicing Formless
worship. Idol worship started during the reign of King
Ashoka. After adopting Buddhism he installed the statues
of Mahatma Buddha in monasteries. Before him there is
no example of Idol worship.
Everybody in the world irrespective of his own religion
wants to know about himself (his being). In the beginning
after the creation of our Universe, man might have tried
searching the Universe to find the God, but might not have
reached far, because neither resources nor means were
available. The man must have exhausted himself and must
have given up his efforts. Initially he must have seen the
world around him and might have tried to find out more
about its creator. When we see a high tower, we think that
it must have been constructed by a rich man. Similarly
seeing the Universe he must have thought that it must
have been built by some powerful force and might have
searched for Him everywhere from east to west and from
north to south. He must have exhausted himself after the
long search, but must not have been satisfied. After
searching in all the directions, some people must have
concluded that the God is invisible and thereafter must
have accepted that this earth might be the God. Why?
Because it gives us everything we need. Some must have
thought that water is God, because it is supporting life.
Some people must have regarded air as God. They must


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 81
have justified themselves by saying that without it nobody
can even survive. Some people must have thought that the
one, who is the creator all these elements is God. Thus we
find that there is respect for God in everyone’s heart.
We all are obliged to our mother because she has given
birth and also nurtured us. Likewise everybody pays
respect to the God. The earth, on which we move, was
respected like God. The sun, in whose light we see
everything, was honoured like God. Where did the man
reach? Even today, some people regard water as God.
There is no dearth of people who believe that water is God
or of those, who believe that Krishna is God or Ram is
God. Ultimately what is correct, nobody tells. There is a
typical mind set in this country that none wants to go
beyond one’s beliefs i.e. one, who is attached to a
particular belief, does not want to move even an inch
beyond it.
In devotion, faith is of utmost importance. Sans faith
there is no devotion. One, who has faith in all the powers,
does not have devotion at all because he does not have
faith in anybody.
One man said that he can eat just anything whether be
it mutton, beef, ants or vegetables. What will you call such
a man?
I see four types of people- first, my own followers.
They are my own people. Then there are people who have
quest for knowledge. They are also good people. When
they understand my philosophy, they too, will come to me.
Then I see my critics. I consider them too as my own
people. They are my keen observers. They will also come
within my fold some day. Fourth types are those who are
not taking any side. They are neutral. I consider them as
very dangerous. They do not appear to be my own.
Somebody asked Mahatma Buddha how many types of
people are there? Buddha told, “First type of people, are


82 Sahib Bandgi
those who believe in God, perform good deeds and do
good things which benefit others. The second type of
people, are those who appear to be peaceful but for the
sake of their own benefit, can go to any extent. The third
type of people, are those who do not hesitate to take
someone’s life. I consider them to be as demons. The
fourth type of people, are those who can torture anybody
for no reason. There is no word in my vocabulary for
them. They are the most dangerous.
Therefore those who say that they worship all gods, are
most dangerous. Their devotion is wavering. They regard
themselves as great devotees but in fact, they are still
wandering. They should not regard themselves as great
devotees.
During the performance of a yagna, the princes of
Nanda dynasty had insulted Chanakya, as he was a black
Brahmin. To take revenge Chanakya encouraged the son
of the King’s mistress, Chandra Gupta and motivated him
to take his rightful share. Chandra Gupta slowly killed all
the princes and became the King of Pataliputra but, as he
was the son of the King’s mistress, people did not honour
him as they would honour a King.
The same treatment was meted to his son – King
Ashoka too. The truth is that he did not embrace
Buddhism after the bloodshed in the Battle of Kalinga.
When he did not get respect like a King from the people,
he was aggrieved and embraced Buddhism. Then he
committed a mistake. He got Buddhist monasteries
constructed and installed statues of Buddha there. His
daughter propagated Buddhism in the neighbouring
countries like Sri Lanka (at that time Lanka) etc.
I want to tell you that the religious places have been a
subject of dispute ever since. Those living in the
monasteries had a lot of wealth. With passage of time;
they engaged themselves in lustful activities. Later when


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 83
Kshatriya kings came to power, they killed the monks.
Those statues were replaced with the statues of Hindu
gods and goddesses. One section of the society did these
things as they saw that there was a lot of wealth in the
monasteries. This is how idol worship came into
existence. Mohd.-Bin-Kasim, a Muslim invader, also
attacked temples like Sarnath etc. and built mosques in
their places. Thus we see how religious places became the
subject of dispute. After this came the Englishmen. They
built churches with the power of wealth.
If you see in the present scenario too, romance has
crept in Idol worship. Singing and dancing have become
normal things. Thus this is clear that the Idol worship is
not focusing much on the welfare of the soul. I have
neither engaged any Pathi (one who can preach on my
behalf) or any Ragi (one who can chant hymns in different
ragas of classical Indian style singing). The devotion has
been overpowered by these superfluous things. It has been
bound within these limits. Matured people are not being
seen in this form of devotion. The people entering this
arena are businessmen. Common people are quite
disillusioned with this system. Furthermore the
intellectuals are getting disaligned. There has been a lot of
distortion in this devotion. So you need to be very
cautious.
Besides the Idol worship the other form of devotion
visible to us, is the Formless worship. This is practised
mainly through five yogic postures. I am well versed with
these five postures, but today the teachers of these
postures do not have complete knowledge about these.
They are running their business but the society is being
misled. Sixteen prominent religious sects of India are
based on these but no rules are visible. Sahib has preached
beyond all these. In this way, the man has started
searching his inner-world very late.


84 Sahib Bandgi

It is now clear that initially there was only formless
devotion. What is this? Let us see. What are the
differences between the two? Let us understand them.
_Jyoti Niranjan Chachari Mudra, So Hai Nainan Mahi.
Tehi Ko Jana Gorakh Yogi, Maha Tej Hai Tahin._
The practice of Chachari Mudra –one of the five
postures of formless devotion, was popularized by Gorakh
Nath. For this posture, the devotee concentrates his
attention on the point in the middle of the two eyes (third
til). After becoming an expert of this posture, the devotee
sees the divine light. It is very blissful. When the cells in
his brain get awakened, he can see all the events of the
past, present and future. He can even disillusion or
disarray anybody’s mind. If he concentrates his breath on
the tip of the nose keeping somebody’s face in his mind,
the latter will feel asphyxiated. He gets supernatural
powers (Siddhis) also. That is why sometimes some
people go to such people for seeking their help, like “I do
not have a child. Please bestow your grace on me.” After
getting such supernatural powers, yogis (such persons
who excel in this posture) become quite arrogant. The
Pranayam (controlling breath) is of great importance here.
It is just like learning vowels and consonants i.e. it is the
primary stage of learning. He (Gorakh Nath) was regarded
as one of the six Yogeshwaras (masters of yogas). He used
to say, “Practice this posture, the Alakh Brahma (Supreme
God) is present there in the form of light. Enliven Him
within you.” But Sahib is saying that this Alakh Brahma is
Kaal (God of death) only.
_Shabd Omar Bhuchari Mudra, Tribute Hai Astana.
Visa Deo Isko Pahichana, Chand Surya So Jana.
The second type of yogic posture is Bhuchari Mudra. Here the
yogi chants the word “Omkar” and focuses his concentration
on the centre of his two eyebrows. Vyas Deo was a master of_


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 85
_this posture. He could even see the sun and moon within
himself_
Before Treta Yug (the second Era), nobody worshipped
Ram and before Dwapar Yug (the third Era), no one
worshipped Krishna but other forms of devotions were
prevalent even in earlier times. There are evidences for
this. There might be more types of devotions in future.
So concentrating at Agya Chakra (lies at the centre of
the forehead and is one of the seven Chakras or energy
centres inside our body), the yogi feels the divine energy
and believes that he will get bliss out of this alone. In this
posture there is a great emphasis on Pranayam and the
yogi sees many worlds (lokas) and even beyond them
within himself. However there are limitations of Formless
worship too. The devotee cannot go beyond the network
of mind and his death and rebirth are bound to happen i.e.
he cannot go beyond the area of mind and body (Maya)
for life long. Further, practicing celibacy is a prerequisite
for this devotion. Married people cannot do yoga.
_Jahan Bhog Tahan Yog Vinasha_**.**
_Wherever there is indulgence in sex, yoga will be worthless._
But these days, yoga is taught to everyone including the
married people. The teacher, who teaches yoga, is married
too. Why do children have greater capacity to learn?
Whenever a person indulges in sex, his nervous system is
affected, but it is surprising that the yoga is being taught to
the married. There are specific yoga exercises for children,
ladies and elderly people, but at present these are being
mixed together and being taught for a hefty fee. This
business is prospering. The formless worship is being
practised by cunning and extremely professional business-
minded people.
The third is Agochari Mudra.
_Sohang Shabd Agochari Mudra, Bhanwar Gufa Asthana,
Shuk Deo Isko Pahichana, Sun Anhad Ki Tana._


86 Sahib Bandgi
_In this posture, the yogi chants the word ‘Sohang’ and
concentrates inside the Shushumna Nerve. The master of this
posture was Shuk Deo. Here the yogi hears the sounds of
various musical intruments i. e. Anahad Nad._
Some sects are practicing this yogic posture. They
practice Surati-shabd-abhyas. The yogi focuses his
attention (his surati) on the word ‘Sohang’. This was
discovered by Shuk Deo. He used to listen to these
different sounds in the twisted part of Shushumna (called
Banknal). Sahib is saying the following about this-
_Jap Mare Ajapa Mare, Anahad Bhi Mar Jaye.
Surati Samani Shabd Mein, Usko Kal Na Khaye_**.**
_Concentrating on different chakras or energy centres inside the
body will be of no avail as everything will end with the death.
But when you concentrate on the holy Name then Niranjan
cannot affect it_
Even today some sects focus their attention on these
sounds. They preach to concentrate on these sounds.
They call them Anahad Naad (unlimited sounds) too.
They are addressing them (these sounds) as God (Supreme
Lord). By focusing in the Banknal, they listen to these
sounds. But Sahib is saying -
_Woh To Shabd Videh._
A sound cannot be produced without the impact of two
things and where there are two things involved, it is
duality. There is no denial to the fact that there is pleasure
in these sounds certainly, but it is not the ultimate Truth.
_Shabda Kahaun To Shabdai Nahin, Shabd Hua Maya Ke
Chhahin._
All kinds of sounds come within the ambit of our body.
Hence these sounds are not the ultimate Truth.
_Sat Shabda So Unmuni Mudra, Soyee Akash Sanehi.
Tamein Jhilmil Jyoti Dikhana, Jana Janak Videhi._
King Janak was the master of Unmuni Mudra-the fourth
posture. He would concentrate in Shahastrasar (7th^
Chakra). Sahib says that it also comes within the ambit of


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 87
the three worlds (lokas). Beyond this, there are very
minute cells. But there too, you cannot escape the clutches
of the Kaal Purush.
_Rarankar Khechari Mudra, Daswan Dwar Thikana.
Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshwar Deva, Rarankar Ko Jana._
I have spoken with many learned people about the secrets
found in 10th Aperture. When I talked to them about this, I
found that they were not sure. Everyone points to a
different location for this aperture. It is correct to say that
it is in Shushumna, but how can it be opened, nobody
knows. Some say, “Their master (teacher) has told them
not to tell about it to anybody.” Oh ho! Such knowledge
has no meaning. It is in fact a fraud with the disciples.
_Sun Sadhu Yehan Hai Bada Dhoka.Upar Nirmal Andar Khota.

Listen to me people, there is big fraud being played here. While
everthing seems blemishlless from outside but it is full of dirt
from the inside. Your Guru (teacher) is not giving you a fair
deal. Recognize the true guru (Satguru). He should have
pactised celibacy from his childhood. He should not have any
greed. He should manage to eat out of his own earnings. Get to
know somebody like this. He should be free from of all his
social relationships in the world. Truth should be his weapon.
He should be an altruist. He should possess the complete
knowledge of all the three worlds. Consider only such a person
as Satguru. He should give message of Satya Lok (the Supreme
Lord’s abode). He should concentrate on the Satya Naam. He
should not focus on the eternal sounds inside the body. He
should possess Paras Surati (i.e. has the power to uplift the
souls). Such a person only should be considered as your Sahib_


88 Sahib Bandgi
So at that time the functioning of the entire body has
to be ceased. Just like, when you sleep, you enter that state
after ceasing the functioning of your physical body. This
way some curtain is drawn on your eyes and you cannot
see anything. Some curtain is drawn on the ears too. Now
you cannot hear anything. Some curtain is drawn on your
nose and you are not in a position to smell anything good
or bad. So it is proved that you dream after the normal
state of your physical body (wakeful state) is ceased.
Similarly, without ceasing the states of sleep and
wakefulness, you cannot enter Shushumna. Just like the
day and night cannot happen at the same time.
Our eyes see the picture. Our nose smells. The brain
thinks. These activities are done by our physical body. We
do these activities. Our wakened state (jagrat awastha) is
through our mind only. Some of our organs are working in
this state. When we fall asleep, the physical body does not
work and we enter into a different body i.e. a shutter has
been drawn on our eyes. Our nose cannot smell because
the sensation in that organ has been stopped. Our ears are
not able to hear anything. There also a shutter has been
drawn. We enter a state, where all these cells have stopped
working. They are being run by the brain. The entire
system becomes almost fainted.
We see dreams during the sleep. In this state also we
have our memory. In the dreams if we meet an
acquaintance, we recognize him. What kind of memory
was this? This was our subconscious memory. This was
not the physical memory i.e. to say that there is one more
memory – a subtle/subconscious memory, within the
physical memory.
_Jus Kele Ke Pat, Pat Pat Mein Pat.
As Gyani Ki Bat, Bat Bat Mein Bat_**.**


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 89
_As a bud in the banana tree has many overlapping layers of
leaves, likewise a knowledgable person has a lot of hidden
messages unfolding in what he says._
So can the body, which we get in sleep state, be
considered the soul? No, in our dreams too, we sometimes
do wrong things. We even get scared and we quarrel too.
The body we get in sleep state is called ‘Ling’ Sharir
(body). The third body is known as ‘Karan’ Sharir. This is
a very strange body. This is the body of concentration and
is related to the memory. There is no physical body in it.
Sometimes you find that someone is lost in his thoughts.
We understand all this. We go to him, shake him and ask,
“Where are you?” Actually he was at that very same place,
about which he was thinking. He had reached there with
the help of his ‘Karan’ Sharir.
Sometimes, we remember somebody. You say it aloud
too, that your thoughts are being drawn towards that
person. This concentration is not an ordinary thing. You
have not even tried to remember that person! You are
surprised! You wonder what is happening. Initially his
thought came to you. You have never thought deeply
about it. This happens sometimes. This was the 3rd body,
the ‘Karan’ sharir. All these three are naturally there in
everyone. The rest of the bodies require us to make
efforts. The fourth is ‘Mahakaran sharir’ which yogis get
through concentration. The 5th is ‘Gyandehi’. This body is
very wonderful. There is very little memory in this body
for all the day to day activities. In this state the yogi
experiences the inner world. The sixth is ‘Vigyandehi’.
There is bliss in this body. Actually it is the brain, which
feels the worries and pains etc. It also has the memory, but
in this state, these do not bother him. When in
Vigyandehi, you are beyond the reach of the mind. Like
when you fall asleep, the physical body has no access to
that state. It’s a wonderful body. Five postures reach up to


90 Sahib Bandgi
this state (Vigyandehi). After reaching there, you coalesce
with Nirakar (formless God), but you still don’t become
fully soul centric. Yoga can help you to reach up to this
state only. You are still in a body. In this body to the mind
exists in subtle state. This is the limit of yoga. Yoga
reaches up to ‘Turiyatit’ state. After obtaining this body
the yogi sees the inner world without his physical eyes,
hears without physical ears, smells without physical nose
and performs several activities without physical hands.
Thus there are six bodies and six states. While you are
awake, your physical body is working. This is the first
state i.e. ‘wakeful / jagrat awastha’. At this moment your
thoughts are different and your concentration is in the
eyes. When you are dreaming, your thoughts are different.
This is the second state i.e. ‘dreaming / swapnawastha’. In
this state, the concentration is in a tiny cell in the throat
region. The third state is of deep slumber / sushupti
awastha. In that state, your concentration is centered in the
navel area. When you reach in the deep slumber, you
reach a state of coma i.e. to say that the level of
concentration is drastically reduced, but there is still subtle
consciousness. In your dreams too you remember who you
are. Basically all the states are the same, only the level of
consciousness increases or decreases like the electrical
voltage increases or decreases.
In the wakeful state, we have sense about the material
world. The mind works in this state. The base of our
dream is our inner self. At that time it is active. In this
state, where we have active physical senses, the mind is
active. This feeling, that you are Lahar Singh, is due to the
mind. You remember that your mother is there. This is due
to the memory. This memory is also a form of mind.
_Kahat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Jagat Bana Hai Man Se._
Kabir Sahib says that the world is made up of Mind only


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 91
You see when you are in dreams too; your level of
consciousness is different. In that state the level of
consciousness is 16 times lesser than in the wakeful state.
In dreams your mindset is different but your mind is still
there i.e. to say you are not beyond the limits of mind; you
are still within the clutches of mind. That is why this state
cannot be considered to be a pure state. The third is the
deep slumber. During this state the level of consciousness
is minimal. You can equate it to the unconscious state. In
this state too you are not closer to your soul. This state is
also misleading. The fourth is ‘Turiya’. What is this? This
is also a state of mind. We see our inner world and many
things there in this state. At that time also this
consciousness remains with us. This conscience remains
with us forever even after death and rebirth. This is what
the mind but there is some part of soul mixed in this state
of mind. If, in that state you meet Lord Shiva, it remains
in your memory that you met him i.e. there also you did
not go out of the boundaries of mind. Even there we are
seeing and recognizing the articles. There also the same
mind exists, but only Yogeshwaras reach up to
‘Mahashunya’ Loka which has no articles. This way
‘Tuiyatit’ state is achieved. This is an extremely blissful
state. The activity of the mind is least in this state, but
even here the mind is present. Here you do not feel the
presence of any articles around you. Only 6 yogeshwaras
have attained this state, but they too could not escape the
clutches of mind.
_Manahi swarupi Deo Niranjan, tohi raha bharmayee.
The mind manifests itself as various Gods and Goddesses in
order to mislead us_
When you eat something tasty, you feel pleasant. No, the
mind got this pleasure (and not the soul). Some believers
of other ideologies advise you to keep the mind happy and
never to make it angry. Why? Our belief is just the


92 Sahib Bandgi
opposite. They say so because they worship the Nirakar
(formless god).
_Nirakar maan hi ko jano.
Kabir sahib says that our mind itself is the formless God/
Nirakar_
But such people themselves do not understand why are
they saying so? We are saying just the opposite.
_Manahi ahe kal karala, jeev nachaye kare behala.
Jeeva ke sang maan kal rahayee, agyani nar janat nahin.
Kabir sahib says here that Our Mind is the God of death and it
is he who resides in all of us and makes us dance to its tunes_
Our behviour will never match with that of others at any
point of time. There is no synchronization between us and
our other relatives. All others are similar. A crow can
quickly adjust with another crow but it will be difficult for
it to adjust with a swan (hansa). You are different from
every angle. Just see the crow. It always quarrels and is
restless. It is a dirty creature. First of all, it is black in
colour. It is not good in terms of its colour and
appearance. Secondly, its eating habits are bad. Whatever
dirt it gets, it eats. All its activities are bad. A pig also has
the soul but this does not mean that you should embrace it.
So Sahib (the Supreme Lord) has made the soul quite
strong. Whatever joys and sorrows, you are feeling, are
due to the Mind.
_Man Hi Karta, Man Hi Bogotá.
The mind itself does all the acts and enjoys it too_
This is the state of mind. You ate tasty food. You
enjoyed it. Who got this enjoyment? It's the body! The
whole world is running after this pleasure. The soul which
is imprisoned behind your personality has been tricked.
Due to this it believes that every decision taken in the
body is its own. Its joys are being accepted by the soul as
its own. The moon, the sun and the stars will not throw
light on this fact. Only the Satguru will enlighten your
soul.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 93
Your feeling of self i.e. your personality is due to the
trick being played on your soul. Why has mind the tricked
the soul? What benefit did it (mind) get? You require the
energy from the soul in order to enjoy these pleasures.
Without the energy of the soul, the mind cannot get
pleasure anywhere.
Therefore, some preachers are preaching to keep the
mind happy and not to annoy it. They are saying so
because they are preaching the formless God which is just
this Mind, but what we are saying is exactly opposite.
_Jo Man Par Aswar Hai, Aisa Birla Koye.
Rare are the people, who have complete control over the mind._
When my people tell me that the world is opposing us,
I tell them that you are moving in the right direction.
Sahib has said-
_Charo Taraf Mar Mar Jab Dhaye, Tab Lalon Ke Lal Kahalaye.
When everyone around you disagrees to the extent of harming
you physically, then you should consider yourself to be moving
in the right direction_
So within this personality, the soul resides. It believes
that, “I am the body.” At the time of giving the holy
Name, I churned this personality and concentrated the
soul. Nobody except me can do this work in the world.
Now that soul is fighting with the mind. Earlier it was not
able to oppose the mind.
One man called me up. He said, “My name is
Lakhvinder.” I said, “Tell me.” He said “a great man once
met me and asked me upto what level have I reached in
the inner world? Guruji, I have full faith in you, but I
could not answer him. Please shower your grace on me
and help me reach somewhere in the inner world so that I
am able to tell everyone about it. That great man was
saying that there in nothing to achieve in Sahib Bandgi
sect. Take the holy Name from me.”


94 Sahib Bandgi
I told him, “I have taken you far ahead on this subject.”
He was surprised as he believed that he did not get
anything. I further said, “I have gradually moved you
away from the limits of the mind. I have internally
changed you. Don’t you feel that you are a changed man
now? The people in the world are confused. It is these
forces that have entangled the soul but you are getting
relieved of them. How can you say that you have not
reached anywhere?” He said “But you have never told this
earlier.” I said, “Oh Lakhvinder! All the yogis and
worshippers are in the fold of mind and body (Maya). I
have removed you far away from the chaos of the three
worlds.” He said, “I shall go and answer that great man
tomorrow.” He met him the next day and put forth his
arguments. That great man agreed that he (Lakhvinder)
was really far ahead of him.
Thus someone may have reached any level in the field
of Yoga but till he is within the boundaries of mind and
body, he has actually reached nowhere. Sahib has said-
_Abhi Nahin Guru Ka Bachcha, Abhi Kachcha Re Kachcha._
If we meet someone who can tell our future and we
consider him as an accomplished one. If someone shows
us some light somewhere, we believe that he is an
accomplished one. We believe in such things only. Sahib
is saying-
_Abahin Nahin Guru Kai Bachcha, Abahin Kachcha Re
Kachcha.
Kahin Gupt Kahin Pargat Hove, Gokul, Mathura, Kashi.
Pawan Charhave, Siddh Kahave, Hoye Surya Lok Ka Vasi.
Tabahun Nahin Guru Kai Bachcha, Abahin Kachcha Re
Kachcha_**.**
He says, if someone gets so much power that he can
disappear from one place and appear at another place e.g.
he disappears at Varanasi and reappears at Delhi or


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 95
disappears at Mathura and reappears at Mount Kailash,
then too don’t believe that he is an accomplished one.
_Jal Ke Upar Asan Mare, Jo Bole So Hovega.
Ved Vividh Ke Marag Chhane, Tan Lakkar Kari Darega.
Jogi Hoye Ke Jog Kamave, Rom Rom Kari Chhanega.
Teen Lok Mein Kachhu Na Chhode, Pura Jog Kamavega.
Tabahun Nahin Guru Ka Bachcha, Abahin Kachcha Re
Kachcha._
Even if he studied all the four Vedas, yet he is an
unaccomplished one because he still did not come out of
the boundaries of the mind. You do not have to come out
of any cave. It is not so. Its (mind’s) limits are quite
extensive. The mind exists till the point of remembrance.
Until you have control over your memory, it means your
mind is in operation. Till you feel that you are in your own
senses, believe that the mind is functional. When there is
no will or desire, only then consider yourself beyond the
preview of mind.
_Jo Maan Par Aswar Hai, Aisa Birla Koye._
Now what shall happen by practicing yoga? Sahib told
Gorakh Nath-
_Ida Vinashe, Pingla Vinashe, Vinashe Sukhman Nadi.
Kahain Kabir Suno Ho Gorakh, Kahan Lagaihon Tadi._
Sahib has said, “At the time of death everything (Ida,
Pingle and Shushumna nadis) will be destroyed. Then
where will you concentrate? Your foundation itself is
weak.” That is why Sahib is saying-
_Abhi Kachcha Re Kahcha._
Even if you achieve ‘Wak Siddhi’ (power to grant
anything to anybody by the word of mouth), yet you are
not accomplished. Today if someone blesses somebody
with a son everyone starts saying that he is an
accomplished one.
_Kitne Tapasi Tap Kar Dare, Kaya Dari Gara.
Grah Chhod Bhaye Sanyasi, Tau Na Pawat Para._


96 Sahib Bandgi
Because you will still remain within the boundaries of
mind and the mind itself is your sole enemy.
_Tera Bairi Koyee Nahin, Tera Bairi Man_**.**
Then when he is accomplished?
_Sar Nam Satguru Se Paye, Chhar Akshar Se Para.
Ab Bhaya Re Guru Ka Bachcha, Ab Pucca Re Pucca._
When he gets the holy Name from a true Guru
(Satguru), which is beyond the body and mind, then only
he is an accomplished one.
When the Satguru gives such power, then only he can
come out of the limits of the mind. The struggle is against
the mind only. Whatever activities we are doing, they are
being directed by the mind. Whatever desires we have are
coming from the mind only. Sahib has correctly said-
_Teen Lok Mein Manahin Viraji, Tahin Na Chinhat Pandit Kaji._
So after getting the holy Name, all this goes away,
because after that one starts to understand the state of
mind. The devotee starts understanding the his inner self
very well.
_Chashma Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya, Kya Tamashe Ho Rahe.
Dil Satan Kya, Kya Hain Tere, Dil Satane Ke Liye._
There is big loot happening inside. This mind is your
friend. It is your enemy also. It is brave and it is coward
too. Suppose Lahar Singh abused Guptaji. Then Guptaji’s
mind tells “Beat Lahar Singh” but when he saw that Lahar
Singh is stronger, it says “Leave him.”
i.e. the mind became coward here. But sometimes even
in this situation the mind says, “Beat him, we will worry
about the result later” i.e, the mind now became strong.
Just as a magician keeps the monkey dancing to his tunes,
the mind is making the soul dance to its tunes. Until you
have understood this, you cannot claim to have reached
anywhere. World over people are a disgruntled lot.
Reading the misleading scriptures, they have become
disgruntled. People are blindly following others, but


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 97
nobody is able to understand the mind. It is very powerful.
Not a single person can come out of the clutches of the
mind without the holy Name.
Kabir Sahibji has been coming since ages to enlighten
the hansas (pure soul sans mind is called hansa).
Revealing this fact to Dharm Das, Kabir Sahib is says the
following words.
The Supreme Lord told Kabir Sahib -
_Hau Gyani Tum Ansha Hamara, Vachan Satya Main Kahaun
Pukara.
Jo Koyee Sadh Mohin Ko Sadhe, Lobh, Moh, Trishna Kah
Badhe.
Trishna Bandh Sadh Jo Pawe, Awat Lok Vaar Nahin Lawe.
Trishna, Lobh Kal Vyohara, Jo Tajihai So Hansa Hamara._
The Supreme Lord said, “O Gyani (Kabir Sahib)! You
are a part of me. You go to Niranjan’s world to bring the
souls (jeevas) here. Bring those souls to Amar Lok
(Supreme Lord’s abode), who have gone beyond worldly
attachments, greed and desires etc. because these are the
nature of Kaal. Those, who overcome them, should be
regarded as hansas (swans). Considering them as our
hansas, bring them here.
Sahib says-
_Tatchhhana Gyani Vinati Thani, Vachan Tumhar Koyee Nahin
Mani.
Bhaktaheen Aandhar Duniyayee, Ghat Ghat Phans Kal Gayee
Nayee.
Koti Baar Jiwan Parmodha, Koyee Ek Satya Shabda Mam
Sodha._
Sahib says, “No one takes your advice. Kaal is residing
in everyone’s body. The blind world is devoid of your
devotion. I have told millions of times to the souls, but
hardly anyone understands my point.
_Jahu Veg Tum Va Sansara, Jo Samajhe So Utare Para.
Bar Bar Tum Jag Meein Jayee, Appan Kah Sab Katha Sunayee_**.**


98 Sahib Bandgi
The Supreme Lord said, “You go to the world at once
and explain this devotion to the souls. Ones who
understand it will get salvation. You go there again and
again and tell them about Amar Lok.”
_Dharma Das Tab Ham Jag Awa, Apan Kah Jivan Samjhava.
Yug Asankhya Arba Bahu Bita, Kai Kai Bar Prithvi Ham Kita.

Yug, Yug Beet Anantan Bara, Yug, Yug Ayeu Jiva Rakhwara.
Nar Jane Julaha Avtara, Sadhan Kaj Deh Ham Dhara.
Agam Shabda Nahin Jaat Ganwara, Bar Anek Jagat Pukara.
Jivan Barahi Bar Pukara, Nar Dehi Bahuten Hankara._
Sahib says, “O Dharma Das! Then I came to the world
and explained to the souls. Several eras have passed away.
I have been coming to the earth several times. I tried to
explain again and again to them but nobody understood
my words.”
_Jivan Sun Ghar Ghar, Kaha, Nahin Mane Updesh.
Gupt Bhav Ham Tab Bhaye, Chale Amarpur Desh._
Sahib says, “Going from one door to another, I tried
explaining this to them, but nobody accepted my words.
Then I vanished from there and went back to Amar Loka.
_Wah Sat Bole Purush Tab, Suno Sandeshi Ansh.
Bhawsagar Bahu Din Rahe, Ketak Laye Hans_**.**
The Supreme Lord asked, “You were there in the world
for several days, but why did you not bring a single soul
with you?
_Rahe Shabda Sun Tab Kar Jori, Bandichhor Vinay Sun Mori.
Kam Aru Krodh Moh Au Lobha, Maya Phanse Jiva Par
Shobha.
Sakal Jiva Agha Atam Punja, Phiri Phiri Parahi Janam Ke
Kunja_**.**
Sahib said, “All these souls are entangled in the body.
None is able to escape from lust, anger, greed and
attachment etc. Due to this the soul has to take birth again
and again.


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 99
_Tab Samarath As Vachan Uchara, Dunia Jaat Kal Mukh

Then, giving the holy Name (the Soundless Word) to
Kabir Sahib, the Supreme Lord said, “Take this Name and
go to the world again. The souls will come with this
Word.”
_Kam, Krodh Trashna Taje, Tajai Maan Apman.
Satguru Daya Jahi Par, Yam Shir Marde Maan_**.**
The one on whom the true Guru (Satguru) bestows his
grace discards lust, anger, desires, self-respect and ego and
breaks the pride of Kaal.
When Satguru gives the holy Name to someone, that
person gets the power to fight with Kaal. At Rakhbandhu
Ashram there was a bull. It was very strong. One day I
saw that a boy aged about 10-12 years, was taking it
around. When the boy was moving, the bull was moving.
When the boy was running, the bull was also running.
When the boy stopped, the bull also stopped. The reason
for this was that a rope was put across the nostrils of the
bull. Due to this, such a small boy was able to make such
a powerful bull dance to his tunes.


100 Sahib Bandgi
Similarly the guru reins your mind. Then you can move
your mind as per your wishes. In this way, the mind is
controlled with the grace of a true Guru.
_Satguru Mor Rangrej Chunari Mori Rang Dari._
One man took the holy Name from me. He had lost his
son. Some days after taking the holy Name, he told me,
“Guruji, now the loss of my son does not trouble me.
Earlier, whenever anybody talked about him, I used to cry,
but now I am not affected by this grief.”
_Man Hanse Man Roye.........._
This change has crept in.
_Ten Lok Mein Manahin Viraji, Tahi Na Chinhat Pandit Kazi._
Sahib says -
_Satguru Mor Shurma, Kaskar Mara Ban.
Naam Akela Rah Gaya, Paya Pad Nirvana_**.**
I change the man. People tell everyone, “Don’t go
there.” People say it correctly because I make my
disciples unfit for the world.
_Kabira Khada Bazaar Mein, Liye Luhata Hath.
Jo Ghar Phunke Apana, Chale Hamare Sath.
Kabir Sahib says that he is standing with a burning torch in his
hand. Anyone who is ready to torch his house; i.e. the vicious
cycle of attachment, greed, lust, anger etc created by the mind;
should come with me to Amar Lok_
I have changed you certainly. I have changed you
completely. You continue to live in the world. You don’t
have to leave your wife and children somewhere in the
forest.
_So Satguru Mohin Bhave, Jo Bhog Mein Yog Dikhave._
The whole world is in an ebriated state. The people are
insane.
_Jagat Ki Najar Mein Bhagat Gaya, Bhagat Ki Najar Mein
Jagat Gaya._
Every moment you keep focusing on me. That is all
what you have to do.
_Chhana Sumire, Chhana Bisare, Yeh To Sumiran Nahin._


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 101
_Ath Pahar Bhina Rahe, Sumiran Soyee Kahhhin._
You keep remembering the holy Name every moment (all
24 hours in a day). Then how can the mind make you
dance to its tunes.
One person said, “At the time of Initiation you have
asked me to offer you my body, mind and wealth. I gave
them to you honestly. Thereafter you said, “Whatever
good or bad, you have done so far, I am not asking you
about them, but now this body is mine. Don’t do any
wrong work henceforth with this.” Then you said, “Your
wealth is mine.” The man said, “I gave it to you after a lot
of thought.” Then you said, “From now onwards, don’t
use it for any wrong deed. Don’t file a false law suit on
anybody.” You further said, “From now onwards, your
body, wealth and money are mine. Now use them as if
they are mine. I am retuning the body to you. When
Gorakh Nath Initiated someone, he would keep the
disciple with him.” Then you said, “I shall call you
whenever I need but at this time, I am returning the body
to you so that you can look after your parents back home.
Serve them well. I am not binding you. I am returning
your money too to you. You will need it. If you feel, you
may donate as per your wish at Guru’s service but I am
not binding you here. But I am not returning your mind. I
am keeping it with me.” Now Guruji tell me, “If you have
kept my mind with you, then who is troubling me here?”
I said to him, “Really I have kept your mind with me.
This has been agreed between you and me. In fact I have
taken it. It is very naughty. It will sink you. The mother
never gives a knife to a small child. She knows that he
will injure himself with it. In the same way, the mind is
very dangerous due to which I have not returned it to
you.” At this he said, “Then who is disturbing me?” I said,
“Listen, sometimes we tie the animals in open space and
keep the rope a little loose so that it can graze the grass


102 Sahib Bandgi
around it in the area but it cannot run away. We keep the
length of the rope about 20-25 mtr long. The animal
sometimes feels that it is free. It tries to run but then it
gets a jerk due to the rope. I also have tied your mind with
a rope so that you can take care of your house and family,
otherwise I could have tied it very tight, but then you
wouldn't even go back home. You would not have liked
anything. This would have created bigger problems then.
Had Lahar Singh not gone back to his home and if other
person, Mehar Singh wanted to come to me, Lahar Singh’s
wife would not have let Mehar Singh come to me. She
(Lahar Singh’s wife) would have told Mehar Singh’s wife
that even her husband had gone there but he did not return
till date. Then only I and Lahar Singh would have been
left in this sect.
Therefore I have bound your mind with a little longer
rope so that it does not indulge is unnecessary activities.”
Then that man added, “Please tighten my rope a little
more just as the rope of the animal is tightened to reduce
its freedom around the pole.” I told him, “That is also in
your hand. You wind the rope of your concentration a little
more around the pole of my concentration.” Therefore-
_Guru Se Surati Rakh Rah Jori, Jas Natwa Rakhat Hai Dori.
Keep the thread of concentration fixated on Guru, just as the
owner of the monkey keeps its tied to a rop_
A person once called me up. He said, “I am unable to
meditate.” I said, “This is not good. You keep chanting the
holy Name while you are on the move.” He further said, “I
am suffering from breathing disorder. I tried my best but I
am unable to meditate. Under such circumstances, Guruji!
What will happen to me? Will I reach somewhere or will I
keep drifting like this?” He was asking, “Where will I
reach?” I said, “I have told you seven Rules. Do you
follow them?” He said, “Yes.” I said, “Then you will cross
the worldly ocean.” He said, “I have not done any


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 103
penance.” I said, “There is no greater penance than this.
You are following the great Rules.”
_Sanch Barabar Tap Nahin.
There is no bigger penance than being truthful_
In today’s era (Kaliyug), there cannot be a greater
penance than this. You don’t worry.
_Banat Banat Ban Jayee, Guru Ke Dware Lage Raho Bhayee.
(Eventually you will get success; you just have to keep your
faith intact in your Guru)_
Sahib says -
_Dware Dhani Ke Pade Raho Bhai, Dhakka Dhani Ka Khaye.
Dhani Garib Newaj Hai, Jo Dar Chhadi Na Jaye.
Keep standing in front of the rich man’s door even at the cost
of being pushed aside. He will certainly oblige you if you are
persistently there_
Therefore, I was saying that whatever states of
consciousness are there, they are that of mind itself. Even
when a person reaches Turiyatit state, he merges into
formless God (Nirakar) only. There also the mind is
present in coma state. Here too there is no salvation and
you are in bondage. Similarly you are in bondage in
heaven also.
You go there only to reap the fruits of your good
deeds. Therefore without taking the holy Name from a
Satguru, one cannot fathom the worldly ocean.
_Koti Janma Ka Panth Tha, Guru Pal Mein Diya Pahunchaye.
The path of salvation that you have been traversing for many
lives can be completed in a moment with the Guru’s grace_
Sahib has talked about the salvation which is beyond
the reach of form (idol) and formless worship. In today’s
society you can see two types of devotion but they also are
not being practised correctly. If we analyse those forms of
devotion, we find that ‘hurting’ anybody is prohibited. To
tell a lie is a sin. Forgery, fraud and eating meat etc. are
prohibited. Almost every religion is preaching this. Both
these systems of worship were prevalent in the society.


104 Sahib Bandgi
Sahib has spoken beyond these. Sahib has talked about the
Fourth World. Some other people are also talking about
the 4th World, but on asking about this, I have found that
they do not know anything nor do they display any
characteristics to know them.
When I asked somebody to explain how he went to
Amar Loka he told whatever he had read in the literatures.
It is described in one of the Mohammad Sahib’s book
‘Dusmukami Rekhate’ how did he go to Amar Loka after
crossing the ten barriers (the intervening points) which
come in between. But when I ask him how he went there
for the second time, he told me that he had gone there in
the same way. Then I said, “Go away, you do not know it.
You do not know about Vihangam Chaal (Path of Bird-of
Sant Matt)”. Meen and Pipil Mode (Path of Fish and Ants
-Yog Matt) can be undertaken with anybody’s own efforts
but Vihangam Mode can not be undertaken without the
grace of a Satguru. That is--
_Ek Bar Jo Darshan Pate, Jaye Bahuri Vilamb Na Late.
Those who have seen the Supreme Lord once reach there
instantaneously_
In that mode one need to concentrates there and does
not do anything else here. All the intervening points then
disappear.
_Kahain Kabir Vihangam Chal Hamari.
Kabir Sahib says that he uses Vihangam mode to travel)_
At that time you do have not to cross the ten barriers
the intervening points.
What is the matter? Why is it so? It is because the
attraction of the Supreme Lord is so much that, if one
concentrates on Him, then here no attraction left. Due to
this Sahib says -
_Ek Bar Jo Darshan Pate, Jaye Bahuri Bilamb Na Late._
This movement is called Vihangam. Then one does not
have to go that way. With the other two modes one cannot


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 105
go beyond the 10th aperture. Beyond this one cannot travel
without the true Guru’s grace. Without the grace of a
Satguru the Vihangam mode of travel cannot be done.
When the true Guru’s grace is showered on one, he
obtains even the subtle bodies. The worshipper sees the
whole universe during this voyage. There the mind is not
present. There the mind is not present because one has to
go to the Supreme Lord’s abode. There the entry of mind
is prohibited. The mind has been cursed not to enter there.
Due to this it is possible to visit the Supreme Lord’s abode
only in the Vihangam mode but it cannot be achieved
without the grace of a true Guru (Satguru) even though
you may try a million times. One reaches in front of the
Supreme Lord with the grace of a true Guru.
_Kotin Bhanu Uday Jo Hoyee, Aise Hi Puni Chandra Lakhoyee.
Purush Rome Some Ek Na Hoyee, Aisa Purush Nyara Hai.
Just as the millions of sun’s glow and thousands of moon’s
glows, the Supreme Lord’s each pore glows_
Is there the sun in Amar Loka? No, this has been
described figuratively. Here in this world, the intensity of
light from the sun and moon is highest. He (Kabir Sahib)
is only indicating it taking their comparison. In reality
there are no words to describe that. There is no
comparison. He is only trying to describe in words
something which cannot be described.
Thus once he reaches there, his concentration always
remains there.
_Khavata, Pivata, Sovata, Jagata, Kahain Kabir So Rahe
Mahin.
His concentration remains there – while he is awake or even
while he is eating, drinking or sleeping_
Only then the Sant has Paras concentration (surati). From
where has this Paras concentration come? It comes after
the confluence of his concentration with that of the
Supreme Lord. The holy Name is given with this
concentration only. This does all the wonders.


106 Sahib Bandgi
_Lali Mere Lal Ki, Jit Dekhun Tit Lal.
Lali Dekhan Main Gayee, Main Bhi Ho Gayee Lal.
When I went to see the Supreme Lord, I could see him
everywhere and I too became like him.
Sahib Teri Sahibi, Sab Ghat Rahi Samaye.
Jyon Menhdi Ke Pat Mein, Lali Lakhi Na Jaye.
The Supreme lord’s presence can be felt in all the living beings.
However it cannot be visibly seen, just like the redness in the
leaves of henna is not visible until it comes in contact with our
hands_
Due to this Sants have highly active and supreme
concentration. They awaken you. At the time of giving the
holy Name to you, they will awaken your concentration in
a moment.
_Koti Janam Ka Panth Tha, Guru Pal Mein Diya Pahunchaye.
Kabir sahib says that the destination I was trying to reach from
millions of my lives was reached within a second by the grace
of the true guru_
This was done within a short moment. You have been
traversing this path for millions of your lives but when the
Satguru showered His grace on you, you reached there in
a moment. He did this in the same way as the Supreme
Lord did it to Him when He saw the Lord.
_Kag Palat Hansa Kar Dina, Karat Na Lagi Bar._
I have transformed you from a crow to a swan and you did
not even realize this fact.
_Paras Mein Aru Sant Mein, Tu Bado Antaro Man.
Wo Loha Kanchan Kare, Guru Kar Le Aap Saman.
Kabir sahib says that there is a vast difference between a touch
stone and a Guru.While the touch-stone changes iron to gold
and not into another touch-stone, the true Guru will transform
you into the one like himself_
I have transformed you like a bhranga insect transforms
any insect into its own form.
_Guru Ko Keejea Dandwat, Koti Koti Pranam.
Keet Na Jane Bhranga Ko, Guru Kar Le Aap Saman._


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 107
_You must thank the guru a million times because he has
transformed you and made you like himself. This is just like a
bhranga insect transforming an unknown insect into its own
self_
He (guru) transforms you and makes you like himself.
_Purush Rachan Te Nari Hai, Nari Rachan Te Purush.
Purushe Purushe Je Racha, Te Virla Sansar._
There is a hidden secret in every message of Sahib.
_‘Purush Rachan Te Nari Hai’_ i.e. Supreme Lord created Adi
Shakti. This can be understood. Then Adi Shakti gave
birth to Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh i.e. **‘** _Nari Rachan Te
Purush_ **.’** This fact can also be understood. We can
understand upto this point. After this he says-
_Puruhe Purushe Je Racha_ **..............**
How can a man create another man? ‘Yes, of course!’
Genesism will not accept this fact. The day the Guru gives
the holy Naam, he does spiritual genesism in the disciple.
He transforms your personality similar to himself through
his concentration. At this point Sahib has said-
_Jab Main Tha To Guru Nahin, Ab Guru Hai Main Naahin.
Prem Gali Ati Sankari, Ta Mein Dui Na Samahin_**.**
_When I had my own personality Guru’s did not exist. Now
when I have taken the holy name, my personality has
transformed and become similar to my Guru’s. This path of
spiritualism is very narrow; here only one personality survives
not both_
Earlier you were steeped in mind, brain etc. Now _‘Ab
Main Naahin,_ **’** i.e.the Guru has coloured you in its own
colour. The worldly feelings hidden inside you are
henceforth crushed. He has dyed you in his colour.
_Satguru Mor Rangrez, Chunari Mori Rang Dari.
Syahi Rang Chhudaiya, Diya Majitha Rang.
My satguru is like is like a dyer who has coloured the dirty
cloth of my personality to a clean one_
After removing the black colour, he has given you the
white colour i.e. he made you pure. He has enlightened


108 Sahib Bandgi
your heart. This work is done by Bhranga-mata-Ideology
(the way a Bhranga insect transforms another insect into
its own type). Therefore-
_Bhrang-Mata Hoye Jehi Pasa, Soi Guru Satya Dharma Dasa._
Sahib tells Dharma Das that the Guru (teacher), who
possesses this Bhranga Mata Ideology, is the only true
teacher (Satguru) and none other.
The creation of a man from another man i. e. making
you super conscious with his super (Paras) concentration,
changing your personality is what true Guru does.
_Lali Mere Lal Ki, Jit Dekhun Tit Lal.
Lali Dekhan Main Gayee, Main Bhi Ho Gayee Lal._
When He entered into me, I too became like Him.
This way the super concentration came to the Sants.
With this he (the Sant) will transform you and make you
like himself because that super concentration came from
the Supreme Lord himself.
A touch stone cannot transform the iron into another
touch stone. At best it can convert iron into gold, but the
Sant transforms the disciple making the latter like him.
That is the reason for Guru being held in high esteem
_Guru Hain Bade Govind Se, Man Mein Dekh Vichar.
Hari Sumire So Var Hai, Guru Sumire So Par.
Kabir sahib says that you must analyze why the Guru is held to
a higher esteem than the God. This is because if you meditate
on God, you will not attain salvation but if you meditate on a
true Guru, you will get the same instantly_
But people are not aware of these facts. Further no
symptoms are visible either. If somebody claims to be a
mustleman (pahelwan) but has a frail structure, then how
can you believe that he is a mustleman? If someone is
visiting witch-doctors believing in their witch craft,
believing in their stars and is also indulging in other types
of devotion, then it means that he is in utter confusion.
_Khelana Ho To Kheliye, Pacca Ho Ke Khel.
Kachchi Sarason Paire Ke, Khali Bhaya Na Tel._

_If you want to play the game, try to play it with full might. Like
if you try to crush unripe mustard seeds, you would neither get
mustard oil nor the oil cake_
Just like a seed in sown in the field, then it is watered.
After this, the plant grows automatically. In the same way
on the strength of the faith, the seed of devotion grows.
Always keep this feeling -
_I have handed over the burden of my life in your hands. Now
all my successes and failures are also yours_
Concentration and faith are the two principles of
devotion, whether it is form (sagun) or formless worships.
These principles must to be followed but we are telling
you beyond these. Sahib is talking beyond these two. He
has given importance neither to the action nor to the
knowledge or to yoga. He gave importance only to the
Guru’s grace.
_Come here and give salvation to your disciple. I am a criminal
by birth full of vices. You are my savior so please save me. I am
full of lust and am ruthless; I am imperfect to the hilt. Keep me
in your grace and consider me as your servant. I have done lot
of wrong things and never regretted. Treat me as you like –
either forgive me or kill me_
That is why he is saying to leave everything on guru.
_Teen Lok Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Bada Na Koye.
Karta Kare Na Kar Sake, Guru Kare So Hoye.
In these three Worlds there is none greater than a Guru. No
one else can give salvation other than a true Guru_
You may ask how this will happen. You try it out. One
person told me a very nice thing. He said, “I own a small
shop. Earlier, sometimes I had to suffer losses in shop’s
operations. Then I took the holy Name from you. I
surrendered everything with the core of my heart to you.
Now, whenever there is expectation of loss, you yourself
stand in my support. Now I am free from all the worries. I
feel that you only are doing everything.


110 Sahib Bandgi
You must, in true sense, surrender. Small children roam
about freely. They are not worried about anything. They
know that their mother will feed them and will put them to
sleep too. In the same way the ideology of Sants is based
on surrender. This is the devotion in true sense. The Sants’
ideology has talked about the devotion only.
_Age Bhakta Bhaye Bahu Bhari, Kari Bhakti Par Yukti Na
Dhari.
There have been a lot of devotees but they have not been able
to adopt the right method of salvation_
Sahib has elaborated the intricacies of devotion.
_Khak Ho Guru Ke Charan Mein, Tab Tujhe Manjil Mile.
Surrender yourself fully on the feet of your Guru to reach your
goal_
And---
_Ki Dana Khak Mein Mil Kar, Gule Gulzar Hota Hai.
(Reduce your ‘self ’ to the dust of your Guru’s feet if you want
to achieve anything)_
Because, whatever you plan, will be from the mind only.
Due to this I told you to surrender. Only then you will get
His grace and that should be the only desire you must
have.
In the army of a king, two soldiers played an important
role. They saved the king from losing the battle. The king
said, “Bravo soldiers! I ask you what you want.” One of
them demanded a battalion of 10000 soldiers, a number of
elephants and horses, and a huge amount of wealth and the
rule of one district. The king said, “O. K. given.” Then he
asked the second soldier. The second soldier said, “Your
Majesty! I do not want anything. Just bestow your grace
on me. That’s all.” At this the king said, “O soldier! You
have asked for me.”
You don’t ask anything from Sahib. Whatever you ask
for, will be from this world only. You say, “Whatever you
wish, give that to me.”
_Jo Tu Raj Deve, Teri Badiyayee._


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 111
_Jo Tu Bhikh Mangaye, Te Ki Ghat Jayee.
Kabir sahib says that whether you make me a king or you make
a beggar, I shall still look up to you_
Sahib has also said—
_Na Sukh Hal Mein Maja Hai, Na Dukh Hal Main Maja Hai.
Jis Hal Mein Tu Rakhe, Us Hal Mein Maja Hai.
I do not find happiness in the joys and sorrows, I find
happiness only in the way you wish to keep me_
There is fear in the comforts that they might be lost.
_Tera Bhana Mitha Lage.
I am happy the way you like it_
Whenever you are in sorrow, consider it to be a gift
without which you will start loving the world and you
would not like to leave it. Whenever you start loving it,
Sahib gives you a jolt.
Therefore, the three worlds are within the limits of
Kaal (Niranjan). Sahib has talked beyond this. Will the
being (jiva) reach there by performing penance? No!
_Kitne Tapasi Tap Kar Dare, Kaya Dari Gara.
Grah Chhod Bhaye Sanyasi, Tau Na Pawat Para.
Kabir sahib says that innumerable people have done extreme
penance. They even left the comforts of their home for it but to
no avail_
The Guru is a bridge to reach to Supreme Lord. If a
bridge is built across the river, even an ant can cross it. In
the same way the Guru is a bridge with which you can
fathom the worldly ocean. Due to this Sahib has given the
message of guru’s devotion.
_Guru Agya Le Avahi, Guru Agya Le Jahin.
Kahain Kabir Ta Das Ko, Teen Lok Dar Nahin.
Kabir sahib says that if you seek the permission of your Guru
before doing anything, then you need not fear anything in these
three worlds_
This devotion is very subtle. I had to toil hard in order
to establish this devotion and to get my message across to
the people. But the common man does not understand this


112 Sahib Bandgi
devotion easily. I travelled far and wide from one road to
another, from one locality to another and from one village
to another. I have travelled to mountain-regions too and
have even crossed rivers, wherever required.
Initially in Himanchal Pradesh, I went to the house of
Jyoti Prakash (one of my disciple) 2-3 times. I had to
travel 6-7 kms on foot in the mountains. After such hard
work, I managed to convince 5-10 people there. People do
not understand this devotion easily. Drunkards do not
want to join us. The seven rules ward off many people.
Some people feel that their occupation will be at stake.
Hence they do not want to come.
One person went to Haridwar (a Hindu pilgrim place).
There people usually quit some of their bad habits. He too
was asked by the priest to commit to quitting some bad
habit. The man asked, “What should I quit?” The priest
suggested, “Stop taking alcohol.” The man said, “I cannot
leave it. This is only the thing which gives me complete
enjoyment.”
What kind of enjoyment is this? After drinking it, one
will fall down in the gutter. Is this enjoyment? The priest
further suggested, "Quit consuming non-vegetarian food.”
He said, “It’s the only healthy food, I am eating.” Again
the priest said, “Leave the habit of telling a lie.” The man
said, “My factory is pulling along due to lies only. It is
operational due to this” Finally, the priest said, “Then quit
some bad habit as per your own choice.” The man paused
for some time and said, “Alright, I will stop coming here.”
Likewise people say that they do not want to join Sahib
Bandgi sect. We are saying-
_Ahar Shuddham To Buddhi Shuddham.
Purity of food leads to purity of thought_
Therefore, I have toiled hard for establishing this
devotion. Whenever I have to go for a discourse in
Himanchal Pradesh, I have to travel 10 hours one way. It


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 113
is 400 km away. In this manner I have toiled hard day and
night to convince people to join the Sahib Bandgi sect. I
work hard up to 11-12 PM daily. Gradually I have
purchased land and constructed the Ashrams. At every
place I have worked similarly. First of all, I set up the
Ashram. Then I invite people to come over and attend my
discourses. I never ask for donation.
For the first time, when I went to Mumbai, there were
only 10-12 people attending my discourse. At that time I
use to take my disciples from Bhopal to Mumbai. Now
there some thousands have gather. I have gathered my
disciples gradually and with great efforts. Huge crowd
does not come to me. Niranjan does not let them come to
me. One man told one of my secretaries, “I really
appreciate that Shahibji has managed to convince lacs of
disciples, but I am unable to convince my father, my
mother and even my wife.” I told him, “This work has
been done by my disciples. You also should keep on
persuading them. They will definitely understand one
day.” Some of my lady-disciples have added almost 200
disciples each to this sect.
But the truth is that all these disciples have been
brought here by Sahib (the Supreme Lord) himself. If
Lahar Singh claims that he has brought 200 disciples here,
then it is not correct to say so. This was possible only
when Sahib governed his thoughts and he could bring
them. Otherwise it would be impossible for him to bring
even a single person.
One person told, “I am totally illiterate, but when I
explain someone the philosophies of our sect, I don’t
know from where the words pile up into my brain. Later
on I start thinking that I myself didn’t have any prior
knowledge of what I told him.” I said, “You will not
understand this.” Sahib is saying—
_Apahi Kanda Taul Taraju, Apahi Taulan Hara._


114 Sahib Bandgi
_Apahi Leve Apahi Deve, Apahi Hai Banajara.
Apahi Guru Puni Shishya Apahi, Aap Aap Ka Khel Hai Sara.
Kabir sahib says that the Supreme Lord or Sahib is the
balance, He is the weight and He is the one who is weighing.
He is the one who gives, He is the one who takes and He is the
vagabond. It is He who is the Guru, it is He who is the disciple
and all of us are in your scheme of things_
Lahar Singh is not the disciple. He is the disciple
because Sahib (the Supreme Lord) wishes so otherwise
Lahar Singh is nothing but the mind. Lahar Singh would
have run away from here. He is able to devote himself to
Sahib only because Sahib wishes it.

```
Kabir Kalyug Aa Gaya Sant Na Poojay Koey,
Kaami Krodhi Laalchi Inki Bhakti Hoey.
Sahib Ji says that in the duration of Kalyug people will
not worship a true living Sant who holds the supreme
power to liberate the beings from the entrapment of
mind(mann) and body(maya). People will only worship
and follows such Gurus who are filled with lust, anger
and
greed in this phase of Kalyug.
```
```
Paar Lagan Ko Har Koi Chahey,
Bin Satguru Koi Thah Na Paey.
Sahib Ji says that everyone wants to cross this
worldly ocean of mind and body which in reality is an
entanglement for all the beings, but without a true
Satguru
```

Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 115
no being can liberate himself from the endless cycle of
birth and death which is the creation of ‘Kaal Niranjan’
(Mind) not of ‘Sahib’ (Supreme Lord).

He is saying that the God of our three worlds has been
crowned as the king by the Supreme Lord. Now the same
God plays different tricks with the jivas (living beings)
deceiving and confusing them. Being proud of himself, he
has forgotten the Supreme Lord. He is residing in

Sahib is saying that if Niranjan ever divulges the secret
of the Supreme Lord to someone, his three worlds will
become deserted. Due to this, he establishes his own
greatness in the three worlds. Saying ‘infinite’, ‘infinite’
for the God of this world, the four Vedas also talk about
Niranjan only. He has misled everyone. Sahib is telling
Dharma Das that due to all this when none of the jeevas
reached the Supreme Lord, He churned me out of Himself
and said, “You bring those jeevas who are Ankuri jeevas
(deserving living beings who have done good deeds in
their past lives) to me thus saving them from Kal
Niranjan’s clutches. The Supreme Lord has given the
Kingdom of three worlds to Niranjan as He was pleased
with his services. Now if I kill him, His (the Supreme


Now He Is The Disciple Of Satguru 117
Lord’s) words shall be overruled which shall be shameful.
So He has sent me to bring the Ankuri Jeevas to His
abode. Due to this, I repeatedly come to this world to
persuade the jeevas and take them back to Him. Since His
Words cannot be disregarded, I cannot give salvation to all
the jives of the three worlds and take them to His abode
after getting them released from the jaws of Niranjan.”

O Dhramdas! Without knowing the holi Name, the jiva
cannot go to the Supreme Lord’s abode. Without holy
Name the concentration is blind. After getting It (holy
Name) the concentration becomes stable and is able to
reach its destination. Without the holy Name it cannot
reach its abode. It remains cheated in this manner.

Sahib is saying that at the time when there was no earth,

and his where about were unexpressed too. Then He
emerged from there and uttered a word calling it (word)
again and again to create His abode. At that time the
Supreme Lord was alone. Then in which body He was
residing?

Sahibji is saying that, “one, who chants the holy Name,
gets out of the cycle of birth and death. The fear of death
is also overcome by him. The holy Name, I give, is the
Essence (Sar) Name. One, who recognizes it, is released
from the clutches of Kal (Niranjan).”

Kabir Sahib says, “One, who chants the holy Name,
which is like Nectar, becomes like Nectar. Anyone, who
does not get this holy Name, will perish on the Dooms’
Day. Even Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh do not know
about the holy Name, which I am telling. Niranjan also
cannot get this holy Name. O Darmadas! Such is the
Name, I have given to you. The Supreme Lord has given
the Nectar in the form of holy Name to you.

The Supreme Lord first created five forms of Nectar.
From them the five elements were created. From Achal
Ami the sky element, from Shabda Ami the air element,
from Ajar Ami the fire element, from Akash Ami the water
element and from Rang Ami the earth element was
created. From these elements our mortal body was created
in which three different characteristics (three gunas) were
added. Nobody could comprehend the secrets of the body.
The moment jeeva got into the body, death (kal) and lust
started troubling it. Only one who recognized the soul
could attain the state of bliss.

Only a Satguru can help disciple see the Supreme Lord.
Without His (Satguru’s) help, no one can get the end of
this worldly ocean. Those, who have faith in their guru,
will overcome this worldly ocean and reach the Supreme
Lords’ abode. On the strength of the true (satya) word, one
who loves his guru from the bottom of his heart is like a
swan (hansa) and the man who is devoid of this is like a
crow. Guru himself is the true holy Essence (Sar) Name.
Physically guru is visible in the form of the body and
subtly he is in the form of the Satya Naam. The Guru
himself is the earth, the air, the moon, the sun and the sky.
The guru is one who is residing in the water and earth.
Guru himself is Brahma, he is Vishnu and he himself is
Mahesh (Shiva). Guru himself is the God, Kurm and
Shesha. The disciple should see the Guru himself in all
that he sees in this mortal world and no one other than the
Guru. He should consider that Guru is present in all the
jeevas and not a single jeeva is without him (Guru). Sahib
is saying that one, who sees only Guru in every jeeva, is
an adorable hansa (pure soul).

One, who always keeps his attention focused on his
Guru’s feet, goes to the Supreme Lord abode. Just as a
honey bee is always attracted to the lotus flower, similarly
the disciple should always keep his focus on his Guru’s
feet. He should dedicate his body, mind and wealth to the
Guru. He should always try to see him to taste the nectar
flowing from Guru’s eyes and should drink the holy water
(charanamrut). This way he will reach closer to the
Supreme Lord. One, who is without the Guru, should not
be offered the holy water because he is entangled in the
worldly affairs.

Kaise Taakar Hoye Ubara, Budhahin Bhavasagar Ki Dhara._

O Dharmadas! Just as you are following my teachings,
similarly every disciple should follow the teachings of his
Guru whole hearedaly. He should dedicate every thing to
his Guru i.e. his body, mind and his self respect. In such
situation the Guru enters in the heart of the disciple, but if
he has even a hint of deceit in his heart, he can not enjoy
his (Guru’s) affection. Then he can not get the spiritual
benefit. He will sink in the current of the wordly ocean.

122 Sahib Bandgi
Dadu Dayal ji says that people are engaged in Sargun
(with form) or Nirgun (formless) forms of worship &
seems to be satisfied with such worships. But, Kabir
Sahib’s philosophy is altogether different from these &
is indescribable. The Hindus remain within the limits
of shunya whereas the Muslims has there reach above
shunya. But, Kabir Sahib shows the rare path to be
followed which is beyond the reach of both shunya and
maha-shunya creations.

#### Easy And Difficult

**It is very easy--**
To go on committing sins,
To aggravate your temperament under the influence of mind,
To harm and kill,
To argue and quarrel,
To shed other’s blood and
To hurt others like demons.
**It is difficult. It is indeed very difficult--**
To forget and forgive the others’ faults from the bottom of
your heart and
To keep on forgiving.
**It is very easy--**
To give in to the lust,
To be blinded by lust and
To indulge in misdeeds.
**It is of course difficult—**
To think before doing something,
To stop the feeling of lust and
To renounce the worldly pleasures.
**It is very easy--**
To give into the greed and
To exploit the poor to fill our own coffers.
**But it is very difficult—**
To devote oneself to the truth and
To spend one’s money for others’ needs.
**It is so easy—**
To remain overwhelmed with the affection of near and dear
ones’ and
To keep remembering often one’s wife, children and near and
dear ones.
**But it is very difficult and rather extremely difficult—**
To forget everybody even for a moment,
To remove you attention from the world and
To focus on the Satguru.
**It is very easy---**


124 Sahib Bandgi
To be steeped in pride,
To boast of your wealth,
To show the glamour,
To show off your knowledge after convincing others,
To show off the pride of high caste,
To scare others by showing off your strength and
To terrorise innocents.
**But it is very difficult-**
To overcome the pride,
To face the truth and
To accept criticism in a positive spirit.
**It is even very easy** —
To please the mind and
To keep on drifting in the waves of the mind,
**But my dear friends! It is very difficult—**
To rein in your mind,
To always follow the Guru’s words,
To sacrifice the name and fame in the society and
To please the Satguru by your deeds.

FORMLESS MIND- GOD

_Teen Lok Jo Kal Satawe, Tako Sab Jag Dhyan Lagawe,
Nirakar Jehi Ved Bakhanai, Soyee Kal Koyee Maram Na
Janai._

The formless god, which is being talked about in the
Vedas, is Kaal (the god of death) but nobody knows about
him. His sons are the three gods (Brahma, Vishnu and
Shiv) and the whole world is worshipping them. The
whole world is entangled in the clutches of the three
characteristics (gunas). The one, who is being worshipped
by the world, eats up all the jeevas in the end. All the souls
(jeevas) belong to the Supreme Lord—Sahib but Yama
(another name of the god of death) has misled and
entangled them in his clutches.
First Niranajan takes up the form of demons to
trouble the living beings. And then he himself incarnates
to kill those demons. Jeevas do not realize this. They reach
out to this God to get relief from their troubles and pray to
God for their protection. Everyone thinks that he is our
master, he is our savior. However Kaal is deceiving
everyone. The living beings see his grandeur, and
mistakenly believe him to be their savior, but in the end he
himself disappoints them and eats them. Kaal disguises
himself into a kind hearted God, shows his kindness to
everyone and later on kills them.
_Na Kuchh Kiya Na Kari Saka, Na Karane Yog Sharir.
Jo Kuchh Kiya Sahib Kiya, Bhaya Kabir Kabir.
I did not do anything. Neither am I capable nor is my body
capable of doing anything. Whatever has been done has been
done by the Supreme Lord (Sahib) only who is residing within
me. Only then I could become one like Him._
The guru, who tells you to do good deeds and to
meditate etc. in order to attain salvation, is not a Sant at
all. He is an imposter in the guise of a Sant who does not
have the real knowledge. He is imparting you only
bookish knowledge. The Sants are capable of giving


126 Sahib Bandgi
salvation while he is incapable. The Sant tells you what he
has actually seen while other one talks on the basis of his
bookish knowledge. The Sants have really been to the
Supreme Lord’s abode (Amar Loka) but the other one has
not even dreamt of it (Amar Loka). Had he seen It in his
dreams, he would have realized that he has not seen It
with his own efforts but someone else has shown It to him.
It is a fact that the Supreme Lord’s abode cannot be seen
even in dreams, let alone reaching there. Hence someone,
who does not know about the Theory of Branga Mat
(transforming someone to make him like himself), is a big
enemy of yours because he is keeping you in dark. Always
keep in mind that someone, who is telling you to do good
deeds, practice meditation etc. to get salvation, will not do
you any good rather he will only doom you and nothing
else because that imposter does not know even this fact
that--
As per the Sant’s ideology, a disciple is Initiated only
by placing the Guru’s palm on the disciple’s head. Some
disciples of other sect say that their teacher blessed them
with the holy Name over the microphone while some say
that they were blessed over T.V. No, Initiation cannot be
done like this. One person asked me, “If you have to
indoctrinate 1000 disciples, will you place your palm on
each one’s head?” I said, “Even if I have to indoctrinate
one lakh people at the same time, I shall do it this way
because this is the process of Initiation. It is done like this
only. This is the only way of indoctrinating the disciple as
the Guru has to pass on the spiritual energy to the
disciple.”
