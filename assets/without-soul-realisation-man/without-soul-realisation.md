### A Few Words

I want to impart true knowledge to you. At present,
none is talking about such a kind of knowledge. All seem to
be misled. Some are misled about the knowledge related to
the inner world while others are misled about the inner world
itself.
In this world, all the modes of worship (Sargun or the
Nirgun) are related to Kaal Niranjan and lack the full spiritual
knowledge. Without the true spiritual knowledge, a soul can’t
free itself from the repeated cycle of birth and death. A being
finds it difficult to search such an enlightened soul who can
show him the true and real mode of worship that can help him
to reach back to Amarlok (origin of soul).
Va Ghar Ki Sudhi Koi Na Batave, Jehvan se Hansa Aaya Hai.
None tells the whereabouts of the abode wherefrom
Hansa has come. Without realising Param Purush, a soul can’t
attain permanent salvation. And in order to realise Him, there
is need to get blessed with a true ‘Naam’ from some real
Satguru. But, instead of understanding this secret, the worldly
people get entrapped in the net of the hypocrites and thus re-
main wandering in an outer world. Param Purush resides within
us but we are making a search of Him in an outer world. The
hypocrites have entangled us in the unnecessary net of rites
and rituals like Yoga, hard worship and the like that have noth-
ing to do with the true realisation of God. He can be realised
in a very easy way by following the path shown by some Sant
Satguru.

### Supreme Lord Then

### Remained Hidden From Sight

```
This human physical body of ours has poison as well
```
as nectar in it. Inspite of his ability and intellect, man has not

been able to understand the entire system of his body. It is a

matter of great sorrow to know that man still doesn’t have

any knowledge about the place where the soul and the mind

resides within the body and the power each of them possesses.

Moreover, he doesn’t know wherefrom he has come and
where he has to go after his departure from the world.

```
A serious thought to all this will reveal that the forces
```
that are opposing and misleading us are lying within ourselves

and not somewhere outside. In heaven, people go only to reap

the fruit of their good deeds. After reaping the fruit, they have

to return to this mortal world again because going to heaven

has nothing to do with attaining of salvation. In fact, none of

the abodes in the three lok’s (universe) is safe.

Saeyaad Ke Kaboo Mein Hain Sab Jeev Bicharey.

All the jivas are in the grip of devil hunter who is the
overall controller of the 3 lok’s (universe).

```

```

6 Sahib Bandgi
This controller is none else but mind, who makes all
the beings dance to its tune. The preachers of different modes
of worship are themselves unaware of the spiritual knowledge
and the real mode of worship that can help a being to attain
salvation. So, in such a case, how can they help it to reach
back to its real abode.
Andhey Ko Andha Miley, Raah Batave Kaun.
A blind man can’t be expected to show the path to
another one like him.
Likewise, the present day gurus don’t have the power
to liberate the soul from the grip of the opposing powerful
evil forces.
After their departure from the world, they appoint one
of their family members as their successor exactly in the
same manner as the politicians do.
Sometimes, my disciples say that they have to face
opposition. I tell them that they will have to face opposition
from the hypocrites who are bent upon keeping them
entangled in the unnecessary rites and rituals. All the
enlightened souls who spoke at their times against the
practice of unnecessary rites and rituals, had to face tortures
and inhuman treatment at the hands of the hypocrites though
it is a different thing that after their departure from the world
they are being worshipped as God or as noble and spiritually
enlightened souls.
Likewise, Kabir Sahib started a journey to create
spiritual awakening among the people so as to enable them
have self realisation. Our soul is in bondage. It is being made
to dance as per the dictates of Mind (Kaal Niranjan). Just as
a Juggler makes a monkey do all such acts against its very
nature, the mind also makes the soul do all such acts which


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 7
are in no way related to its nature. When a person goes to
commit a theft, the soul also gets involved in it.
Today, man doesn’t want to become honest and truthful.
All this clearly shows that the modes of worship being
practised are not the real ones.
Saach Barabar Tapp Nahin, Jhooth Barabar Paap.
Ja Ke Hirdey Saach Hai, Ta Ke Hirdey Aap.
No kind of worship can match truthfulness and no kind
of sin is as great as falsehood. In fact, it is the
truthfulness that can take us nearer to our soul and God
whereas it is the falsehood that can take us nearer to the
evil forces of destruction and Kaal Niranjan.
Someone said to me, “Maharaj! Today, there appears
to be an atmosphere of devotion to God. It appears as if man
has realised the short existence of this body.”
But, if we cast a deep look around us, we shall find
the whole religious field like a business centre where
everyone is engaged in exploiting the religious sentiments of
the innocent masses for his own selfish motives. Such
hypocrites are utilising the services of the media for publicity
purposes. For this, they have to make regular payments to the
media persons who, otherwise, have nothing to do with the
sages of the modern times. These media persons are earning
crores of rupees from these sages.
Moreover, all the directors of the various channels are
worldly people with a materialistic approach. Some
organisations are selling the books related to their religious
philosophy at exhorbitant rates while others are raising their
heads with the support of media. All of them lack spiritual
knowledge. We, on the other hand, are offering everything at
unbelievable cheap rates. This is because we don’t believe in
commercialisation of religion.


8 Sahib Bandgi
Even in the purchase of some piece of land, I don’t
pay bribe to anyone in any form except the sum that is payable
in the legal process. I am a man of principle and not a
businessman like the modern sages.
Many such sages are selling even the urine of cows,
they are money minded and political in approach.
One of the friends of a disciple of mine was a teacher.
Both of them used to read in the same class. After 4 or 5
years, his friend gave up his job and began to organise Satvahs
(a week long programme of religious discourses) and
became a Shastri (having knowledge of his religion). My
disciple told him that his act of giving up the job was not a
right step. It was a foolish step. He said, “There was no
foolishness in doing so. I was getting about Rs. 8000/- p.m.
as my salary. Now I earn nearly 50 thousand rupees from a
single Satvah. The disciple asked him as to how did such an
idea enter into his mind. He said, “One boy of our village
couldn’t pass even his 8th class examination and used to sell
articles on a rehdi (vehicle driven by four wheels like that of
a cycle). He became Shastri and in due course of time he
became the owner of many bungalows, motor cars etc. This
inspired me much and today, because of this profession, I have
amassed so much wealth as I couldn’t even imagine to amass
on the basis of my govt. job.”
That is to say, such people have only one target before
them and that is to amass as much wealth as they can. Often
they allow the politicians as well to speak from their stages.
This helps them in widening their sphere of influence and in
creating an impression among the devotees about their links
with the high-ups. I don’t give anyone an opportunity to speak.
I have visited many sages and have had held discussions with


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 9
them. At the very outset, I tell them that I haven’t come to
ask for something as I have received everything from my guru
and rather have come to know of the depth of their spiritual
knowledge. I have found that none of them is in possession
of the true spiritual knowledge. Even the great sages can’t
stand before my disciples so far as the question of spiritual
knowledge is concerned. As such, we shall be denounced and
I am prepared for that.
About the sages occupying the religious places, Kabir
Sahib has said—
Duson Disha Mein Lagi Aag.
Kahey Kabir Kahan Jayio Bhaag.
All the ten directions have been engulfed by fire and
there seems to be no place of safety.
When Kabir Sahib descended on this earth for the first
time, he returned back to Amarlok without taking any Soul
with him. On being asked by Param Purush the reason thereof,
he said, “He, whom I convince in the evening, forgets
everything in the morning and he, whom I convince in the
morning, does so in the evening.”
Kaal Meti Sakal Le Javun.
Kabir Sahib told Param Purush that he had thought of
taking all the Souls alongwith him after destroying Kaal
Niranjan but He had not permitted him to do so.
Everyone in one’s lifetime finds an opportunity to
come near Param Purush. Now, how does this happen?
Any of my disciples will come in contact with such a
fellow and will have some talk about Param Purush. In this
way, the concerned person will get the real opportunity.
There was a boy, Raja by name, from Jaipur. He didn’t
want to marry and wanted to remain away from the


10 Sahib Bandgi
materialistic approach of the world. He asked me many
questions. He said, “If Param Purush knew everything about
the past, the present and the future, He must have in His mind
all that was to happen in the time to come. So, why did He
create Niranjan and made the jivas suffer tortures and miseries
at his hands?”
Soor Dass ji stresses the same point when he says—
Prabu Tumko To Hai Khel Vinoda,
Par Hamein Dukh Bhari Hai.
You remain at all the times in a cheerful mood whereas
we suffer from sorrows and pains.
That boy said, “How can we call Param Purush as kind
if everything is happening as per His desire. If He had pre-
hand knowledge of everything, then it is He and not Niranjan
who is to be blamed for all this.” I answered his sharp
questions in a convincing manner.
He also said that if Param Purush had mind in Him
from the very beginning, He must be having dirt and sinful
thoughts as well. As such, how could they call Him innocent.
I said—
Kaaran Karan Nahin Nirmaye.
Satya Purush Tab Gupt Rahaye.
When nothing like reasoning and thinking existed,
Param Purush was then hidden from sight.
Param Purush was free from any sort of drawback.
Why are we feeling cold? Wherefrom did it come? If
it came alongwith the change in weather, then wherefrom did
the weather come? The earth moves along a circular path.
When it moves away from the sun, we feel cold. This is
because the rays of the sun then remains no longer comes
straight. Further, the cold waves also contribute to the already


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 11
present cold. Why the people living near the sea are black?
This is because at a height of about 20-25 metres above the
sea level, there is warmth and the air, after passing through
this region, also becomes warm. So there is some definite
reason for their becoming black.
Param Purush was hidden from sight. At that time,
there was nothing at all to be found. He desired and created
16 sons. Now the question arises as to why did He make a
desire.
Gupt Hatey Pragat Hoye Aaye.
He was hidden and wanted to make His apearance.
Everyone of us wants to bring our talents to light. A
wrestler does so through his wrestling skills, a musician does
so through singing and so on. All of us are His Hansas. So,
as per His sweet will, He made His appearance.
Pratham Purush Shabad Parkasa....
First of all, Param Purush uttered a word...
A dazzling white light appeared that was an element.
Param Purush absorbed Himself in that light. Niranjan also
did the same. He absorbed himself in shunya. Mind also has
its own desires but these are related to reasoning and
intellect. But the desire of Param Purush was natural and pure.
So Param Purush now became active and henceforth
began to be called as Satya Purush. It was just like a seed that
blooms into a plant.
Shabdai Dharti Shabad Akash.
Shabadi Shabad Bheya Prakash.
The creation of the earth, the sky as well as the light is
a miracle of the ‘word’ alone.
When we throw a handful of water above us, the drops
of water are formed which return back to the earth. Likewise,


12 Sahib Bandgi
Satya Purush threw up a handful of the element He had
produced. The parts so formed changed into countless souls.
There are lot of micro-organisms in the human body.
They are so large in number that it is not possible to have a
count of them. Just as all the ants in your house have souls
in them, the micro-organisms in your body as well have souls
in them.
Yeh Kaya Hai Samrath Keri, Kaya Ki Gati Kahu Na Heri.
This human body is limitless. None can know its moves.
In one sexual intercourse about 2.5 to 3 crores of
micro-organisms come out of the body. What function do
these perform? Where does the flowing water go? It goes
down the slope. All of these run at fast speed towards the
womb of the woman. Each of these wants to become a human
being. In this competitive race, half of these lose their lives
while others get tired and die later on. Only one such
organism succeeds in uniting with the egg of the woman. So
this competition has its origin from the womb of the mother
itself. Since all the micro-organisms except the one have to
die, so the sexual intercourse has been called as a great sin.
In fact, every kind of pleasure has some pain inherent in it.
The semen condenses at a fast speed after its ejection.
That is why, all the organisms except one or in some
exceptional cases more than one (if they succeed in reaching
the appropriate place), lose their lives.
So all the souls formed in Amar lok began to move
about. As per the desire of Param Purush, these maintained
their separate identity. He was very much pleased to see them.
We also feel pleasure on seeing our children. As He wanted
to beautify His Amar lok in order to make it a noble abode,
He created Kooram, Gyan, Vivek etc. simply by uttering of


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 13
words. In the meantime, He thought that if every word spoken
by Him was showing the desired result, He should make an
attempt to create another Param Purush as well.
He desired and another Param Purush appeared before
Him. Param Purush, in order to check whether the newly
created Param Purush resembled Him in all respects or not,
He entered into him. For a moment, He doubted about his
being exactly like Himself. He came out of him. The doubt
was cleared. This will of Him had created Niranjan. Trouble
surfaced from this very moment.
In this way, Param Purush created 16 sons simply by
uttering of words. There was immense pleasure in Amar Lok.
Param Purush didn’t want to let Niranjan stay in Amar lok but
the latter worshipped Him and asked for some place. Param
Purush asked him to live in Maansarovar, a place of Amarlok.
Niranjan worshipped again and asked for a universe (an abode)
where he could have his full sway. Param Purush said, “All
right! you should create 3 lok’s. The seed of such a creation
is lying in the belly of your elder brother, Kooramji. He is
very kind and will give it to you.” It was the element sky. But,
instead of requesting him to give it to him, he forcibly took
it out of his belly. The latter prayed to Param Purush saying,
“He has forcibly taken out the seed from my belly without
asking for it from me.”
Param Purush said, “You are his elder brother. You
should pardon him for his indecent behaviour.” So Niranjan
created the whole of universe with that seed. From the shunya
(nothingness) he created air. If we bring our two hands near
each other with some pressure, we shall feel the flow of air.
From air he created fire. When we run, we feel the production
of fire in our body. From the fire he created water. While
running, we feel hot and this heat makes us perspire.
Perspiration gives out foul smell and on solidifying, it
changes into wax. This formation of wax after solidification


14 Sahib Bandgi
of perspiration is the earth. In this way, he created 5 elements.
Whole of this universe belongs to Kaal Niranjan.
He created the sun, the moon and etc. but there was
no soul there. Then he worshipped for 64 yug’s. Param
Purush asked him what more he wanted. Niranjan said—
Deejai Khaet Beej Nij Sara.
He requested Param Purush to give him souls he could
rule over.
Then Param Purush produced a female out of His wax.
If we clean dirt from some spot, a part of it is still left behind.
This is called as wax. He used this very wax. That is why there
is an element of doubt in women.
Param Purush gave the souls to Niranjan through
Adhya Shakti, a female whom He produced simply by His own
will. But why did he do so? This is the question that the said
boy had asked. He gave the souls because He knew that
Niranjan and Adhya Shakti won’t be able to do any harm to
them. Niranjan had worshipped and so Param Purush had to
give him what he desired. He was fully aware that none could
do any harm to the soul. It is the mind that becomes
sorrowful. The soul only experiences all that is going on. Man
becomes sad if some part of his body gets damaged or is cut
off. He cries with pain. This body is none else but Niranjan
and Maya. What Param Purush gave to him is a very pure
thing. Niranjan can do no harm to it.
When the female (Adhya Shakti) came to Niranjan, the
latter was charmed to see her beauty. He swallowed her. Love
is, so to say, the distinctive trait of the soul. Param Purush
loved Adhya Shakti and so she became loved one. That is why
every woman has in her the inherent power of love. Inspite
of the fact that she is nothing but a bag of dirt and filth like
man, she attracts others to her. The sole reason behind it is
that Param Purush loved her and so made her nature lovable.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 15
Don’t give place to hatred in your mind. You should
not become violent in any manner. I know that if I show hatred
for someone, whole of the world will begin to hate him.
Though it sounds strange, yet it is a fact. So I am fully alert
about it. While sitting at a place, even the administration of
the whole of universe can be run, but Niranjan is the ruler
here and passing orders on him will reduce him to the position
of a minister. So I am not going to interfere much in his
administration. My job is only to give shelter to the devotees
who come to me.
As Param Purush has blessed him to rule for a period
of 17 chaukdi asankhya yug’s, He is not interfering in his
administration. Uptil now only 4 chaukdi asankhya yug’s have
passed. When the entire period comes to an end, Param
Purush won’t let such a thing to happen again.
At one time, Param Purush had thought of destroying
whole of the creation.
Vachan Karun Pratipal, Morey Desh Na Aavhi.
I have to keep my word. However, he (Niranjan) won’t
come to my abode.
I told the boy that Niranjan has no power to do any
harm to the souls and that Param Purush knew this fact.
On being swallowed by Niranjan, Adhya Shakti prayed
to Param Purush to save her. At this moment, Param Purush
thought of putting an end to his existence but He decided not
to do so.
Tabhi Purush Mohin Pukara, Gyani Bheji Javo Sansara.
Kabir Sahib says that at that moment Param Purush
called him and asked him to go to the mortal world.
Where was Kabir Sahib then? Param Purush created
out of Himself a Super-Power (Kabir Sahib) as He knew that
Niranjan couldn’t be brought under control by any other
means. It is on this account that Kabir Sahib is considered as
Param Purush Himself. But, the Kabir panthis have made a


16 Sahib Bandgi
mess of the whole philosophy and that is why I don’t consider
myself as a Kabir panthi.
This Super-Power of Param Purush has been called by
different names at different times.
After the expiry of 17 Chaukdi Asankhya yug’s, Param
Purush will destroy the very existence of Niranjan and will
take all the Hansas into Himself.
Some say what is the guarantee whether He will, once
again, create such a universe or not. Param Purush won’t do
so as He Himself had to feel sad on seeing all this. If a thing
causes damage to your eyes, you won’t let the same thing
happen again.
At one time, Kabir Sahib began to take souls to
Amarlok in large number. Niranjan came to him and said, “I
have been cursed by Param Purush. What would become of
this curse if you take all the souls like this?
Now the question arises as to why did Param Purush
curse him. The fact is that the punishment has been given to
mind and not to the soul.
Niranjan said that he had been cursed to eat one lac
jivas every day and asked what would happen if there were
no jivas left behind. At one time, Kabir Sahib killed Niranjan
but turned him alive again through his surti (concentration).
That is why Niranjan has no physical body.
Such a thing is possible but if any fellow is brought
back to life, it will create problems. Others will also desire
to see all this before their very eyes. So it is better to do so
from behind the curtain.


```
Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 17
```
### Whole Of The Body

### Is Kaal Niranjan

If you want to see Kaal Niranjan as a physical body,
then you will have to know that all the men are the reflection
of him. And if you want to see Adhya Shakti in the same sense,
you will find her reflection in all the women.
Niranjan said to Kabir Sahib, “If you want to take all
the souls alongwith you, I request you to take me as well
because without souls the punishment awarded to me will
lose its sense.”
No evil spirit (ghost etc.) bothers my disciple. There
is some definite reasoning behind the coming of these evil
spirit. These come either to a person who has teased them
or to one who has loved them during their life time. Once an
evil spirit said to me, “I want to come before you if you kindly
permit me to do so.” I said, “you can come.” Normally these
don’t come in front for fear of receiving a high-power current.
She said, “I request you not to provide unworthy people with
more than enough power.” I said, “what has happened?” She
said, “I used to make some fellow dance to my tune but now
I am not in a position to go near him.” I asked her why it made
him dance. She said, “I was his daughter-in-law. I fell ill and
got bed-ridden. After this, he killed me by pressing my throat.
But I wanted to remain alive. While dying, I thought how I
**17**


18 Sahib Bandgi
could take revenge.”
An evil soul can’t kill anyone with a sword. It can only
affect the normal functioning of the brain. It has no body and
so can enter any other body very easily. It can change its form
and can cause fear. That evil soul said, “I wanted to make them
issueless as I have also died without having any issue. I was
killing them slowly but steadily.” I said, “you won’t go there
now. If you do so, you will have to face punishment.” Then it
put a condition. It said, “Help me attain salvation. I have
committed no fault. Give me justice. I have no other job to
perform except that of anihilating them.”
So I want to tell you that evil spirits can’t come near
you. As soon as you concentrate, they will ran away. These
can come if you lack faith in me.
Let’s move to Adhya Shakti. She is more powerful than
Niranjan. Even the gods seek her shelter after suffering
defeats. But like Niranjan, she also keeps all entangled.
Param Purush is not much offended with her. She herself
comes forward to ward off any misfortune that befalls
Tridevas (Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh) but when she feels
helpless, she meditates on Param Purush and gets power from
Him.
Now the question arises as to how did she fall in the
grip of Niranjan. The latter said to her, “Don’t feel afraid. I
am a male and you are a female. You have souls with you. Both
of us shall do the job of creation. Put these souls into bodies.
We have to mislead the jivas or else all of these will go back
to Amarlok. You have been created because of me and so you
have become my partner.”
Bhagg Nahin Kanya Ko Hato, Nakh Chhider Keen Niranjan.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 19
Adhya Shakti had no vagina. It was the creation of
Niranjan himself.
She had only the organ of urination. After this,
Niranjan entered his semen into her womb.
This was not the way Param Purush had desired the
creation of a true universe. This combination of Mann-Maya
has kept all the jivas in its grip. After blessing with the Alive
holy Name, I separate the soul from the grip of mind. My
devotees won’t feel as other people of the universe do.
As per the dictates of Niranjan, Adhya Shakti misled
the Tridevas and all the souls were also got misled. Now the
question arises as to why did Adhya Shakti do so.
Kabir Sahib says, “Such is the nature of woman. The
parents bring her up but after going to her husband’s house,
she becomes one with them and forgets her parents.”
As such, Adhya Shakti began to behave like a stranger.
In Bhavsagar More Ujado.
So Niranjan prayed to Param Purush not to send Kabir
Sahib on the earth as he had destroyed his worldly ocean
by taking the Souls to Amarlok.
You also feel disturbed if someone destroys your
house. So, Param Purush asked Kabir Sahib to do his job at a
slow pace.
Niranjan said, “None of us will use force. You can take
anyone who is willing to go.”
That is why I am not doing this job briskly. You can be
turned into a Vairagi (he who has no attachment with the
material world) within a minute and you will stop looking at
anybody else. There is some weightage in what Niranjan has
said. One day, Niranjan prayed to Kabir Sahib to bless him as
well with ‘Naam’. The latter said that he won’t do so as


20 Sahib Bandgi
blessing him with ‘Naam’ would mean to put an end to the
existence of whole of the universe. This is because in that
case none would be there to mislead Jivas who alongwith him
(Niranjan, who has misled Jivas) would turn into pure and
virtuous souls.
So I have turned you into pure and virtuous soul by
blessing you with Naam. The mind will play its own game but
you should leave everything to Satguru who, from within you,
will do all that is good for you and Niranjan won’t be able to
exert his influence.

### Kabir Sahib Descends On This

### Earth In Every Yug

I appear in this universe in every yug to take away the
Hansas to Amarlok.
He says that in Satyug he helped four Hansas attain
salvation and they in their turn helped 9 lac jivas do the same.
He further says, “In Treta yug, I helped seven Hansas

including Vashishat Muni and Shringi Rishi while in Dwapar
yug, I helped 17 Jivas attain salvation.”
Regarding Kal yug, Kabir Sahib says, “I helped fourteen
Hansas including Gorakh Nath, Mohd. Sahib, Nanak Devji,
Ramanand, King Bhoj, Shah Sikander and Beer Singh in

attaining up the salvation. Earlier, I helped 5 lac Hansas to
attain salvation and when you appeared on the scene, I helped
42 lac more Hansas do so.” Kabir Sahib told Dharam Dass
that he visits the universe in every yug and takes the Hansas
to Amar lok after creating awareness in them. Kaal Niranjan

has been torturing Jivas in these 3 lok’s and he feels much
pain to see all this.
He further says that he has no parents and has come
from an unknown place and that he who shows faith in the
Alive Holy Name blessed by him, attains permanent salvation.

22 Sahib Bandgi
Kabir Sahib himself was Param Purush. We are moving

ahead with his sayings and philosophy. Any other organisation
will show hesitation in accepting his views and sayings in
completion. There are many reasons behind it. Our
organisation is not the Kabir panth as Kabir Sahib never said
that he should be remembered as a deity. He, rather, accorded

a high status to the Satguru and laid stress on His worship.
But, I quote his sayings as a kind of support as it serves as a
witness to that what I speak. Otherwise, there is no need to
make use of these. Other sages show hesitation in accepting
his views in completion as he was against hypocrisy and has

attacked openly on all the acts related to it. Such sages are
afraid of being exposed if they totally accept his views. They
are thus quoting only such sayings of Kabir Sahib which can
serve their interest. By giving a wrong interpretation to his
sayings, they are trying to justify their own line of Sargun

(with form) or Nirgun (without form) kinds of worship. They
are behaving like a beggar who, in order to beg some money,
quotes this couplet of Kabir Sahib—
Daan Diye Dhan Na Ghatey, Nadi Na Ghatey Neer.
Apni Ankhon Dekh Le, Yun Kathi Kahey Kabir.

Just as the users don’t cause any loss to river water, the
acts of charity also don’t cause any loss of wealth to the
donor. Kabir Sahib says that anyone who likes can see all
this with his own eyes.
But, he will never quote this saying of Kabir Sahib—

Maangan Maran Samaan Hai, Matt Maango Koi Bheekh.
Maangan Te Marna Bhala, Yeh Satguru Ki Seekh.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 23
Begging is just like dying, so none should beg. It is
better to die than begging. This is what the Satguru

teaches us.
He is only trying to make a fool of the people in his
own interest. Kabir Sahib has never favoured begging. He has
left it to the goodwill of the donor if the latter desires to give
alms to some deserving fellow. Though he threw light on the

Sargun as well as the Nirgun kinds of worship, yet he never
said that these can help one attain salvation. He, rather, talked
of Pra-Bhakti, that is far beyond these two kinds of worship.

```
Bahaut Jeev Atke Rahey, Bin Satguru Bhav Mahin.
Dadu Naam Kabir Bin, Chhute Eko Nahin.
—Dadu Dayal Ji
Countless jivas remain entangled in the worldly ocean
of birth and death and none is able to liberate himself
without the blessings and grace of Kabir Sahib.
```

24 Sahib Bandgi

### “Sahib” Has Love For All And

### Hatred For None

Man hasn’t been able to understand clearly the meaning
of the term bondage. He has also failed to understand the
power that has kept him in its grip.
A devil force is present within human being. He has
to understand that it is the worship alone that can help one
attain salvation. But, he hasn’t been able to understand clearly
the concept of worship. At least, one thing is clear that our
soul is in bondage and it is the worship alone that can help
him to get rid of the bondage.
Kabir Sahib has said—
Bahu Bandhan Te Bandhya, Ek Bichara Jeev.
Jeev Bichara Kya Karey, Jo Na Chhudavey Peev.
The poor Jiva has been held in many chains. It can rid
itself of these chains only if Param Purush Himself
comes to its rescue.
In this universe of Kaal, the soul finds itself helpless.
It wants freedom but lacks the power to free itself on its own.
Before talking about freedom, we shall have to turn
our attention to the bondage. Can we see it? Can we know
who has held the soul in bondage? What is the appearance of
the soul?
Let’s try to know what job the soul has been
**24**


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 25
performing within the body made out of five elements. None
speaks about the topics we speak about.
It is not my aim to lower the status of anyone. My sole
aim is to turn man to the true mode of worship by creating
spiritual awakening in him. If we have a close look at the
modern sages, we shall find that some are entangled in illegal
activities; some are wandering like a majnu (a hero-like life
style); some are torturing others through their Tantrik (related
to mystical formulas for the attainment of super-natural
powers) knowledge and so on. We have to think as to what
kind of religious masters they are? Can they prove helpful to
us in attaining salvation? At present, there are many channels
like Sadhna, Aastha etc. that are charging upto Rs. 5 lac per
month from these religious masters for broadcasting their
discourses for about 20 minutes. I myself am paying Rs. 3.50
lac per month. So in 24 hours we can have a vision of 72 sages
on a single channel. Taking all the channels into account, we
can have the vision of about 800 sages every day. If you watch
them minutely, you will find that their style is almost alike.
After telling one or two stories, they tell one or two
prescriptions for different diseases and one or two exercises
though it is a different thing that many of them have fat
bellies. Then they have to dance as well and make the devotees
too to do the same. The latter have to do all this simply to
please their guru. After this, they have to sing one or two
songs as well without bothering whether their tunes are
pleasant or unpleasant. I appear somewhat different from
them. Like other opponents, they don’t miss any opportunity
of opposing me. Often they get many of my programmes
cancelled simply to prevent other people from listening to
my views. Neither I abuse anyone nor I speak against any


26 Sahib Bandgi
religion. They succeed in causing hurdles in my way on the
basis of their money power. They are wealthy because their
sole aim is to amass wealth. I am not wealthy because my aim
is to create spiritual awareness among the masses rather than
amassing wealth. All are alike in my eyes—be they rich or
poor.
The atmosphere of devotion and worship you find
around you is not the spiritual one. The sages tell one or two
stories such as the killing of some demon or devil by the
blow of a particular kind of weapon. Our concept of God has
changed altogether. They take such a fellow as God who has
the power to kill all at one and the same time. If someone
kills his son, he is considered as a cruel person whereas some
other being who kills thousands and thousands of persons, is
considered as God. Kabir Sahib says—
Hai Dayal Droh Nahin Vakey, Kahu Kaun Ko Mara.
Param Purush (Supreme Lord) has love for all and
hatred for none. Also He kills none.
Kabir Sahib also says that Param Purush is altogether
different from all those deities who incarnated at different
times and departed after leaving their mortal bodies behind.
He doesn’t get entangled in the cycle of births and deaths.
Incarnating himself as Bavan, lord Krishan cheated
king Bali. That God (Param Purush) is a donor. King Bali is
counted as one among the six Chakarvarti (who defeated all
the kings of their times) kings. But he had to go to Patal (an
abode below the earth) for his failure to give lord Krishan
the promised land. When the world has taken such a being as
God who cheats others, resorts to killings and does all such
acts who don’t behove a true saviour, it is but natural for the
people to seek the shelter of such gurus who allow their


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 27
disciples to tell lies and do other evil deeds like cheating,
killing and the like alongwith the performance of worship.
But, there is no place for such wrong acts in Sant Mat.
Parshu Ram destroyed the Kshatriyas (race of
warriors). When he began to do so, the latter began to change
their castes. Some became blacksmiths while others became
carpenters and so on. They did so out of fear from Parshu
Ram. So this was God who was bent upon destroying a whole
community. This is nothing but illusion (Maya). Is it good to
destroy the whole race or community for the fault of one or
two members? It is, rather, an act of sin. It clearly shows that
the people of this world are in the hands of some devil force.
Gopi Gwal Na Gokul Aaya, Karte Kans Na Mara.
Hai Meharbaan Sabhin Ko Sahib, Nahin Jeeta Nahin Hara.
Neither that Sahib (Param Purush) did the job of a cow
tender nor did He come to Gokul. Moreover, he didn’t
kill Kansa. That Sahib is kind to all. Neither He gains
victory nor He suffers defeat. But, the Jivas in this Kal
yug have their own thinking.
Once I was in army mess. Four army personnels were
to visit me. Only two of them reached while the remaining
two had gone to watch the Ramayan serial and they had to turn
up late. One of the two who had come, was saying that the
serial that day was not so charming. The other said, “Yes, today
there was a talk about spiritual knowledge. There was no
killing and fighting to be seen.” That is to say, our mental
thinking has developed in wrong direction.
Afterwards, the people began to worship the characters
who had played the roles of Ram, Lakshman and Hanuman.
Not only this much, they began to perform their Aarti even.
The women began to worship the lady who had played the roles


28 Sahib Bandgi
of Sita. Afterwards, Lakshman and Sita began to develop
relations of worldly love for each other.
So our worship has been limited to the acts of killings,
dancing and singing. Nothing like spiritual knowledge is to
be found anywhere.
Kabir Sahib says —
Aatam Gyan Bina Narr Bhatke, Kya Mathura Kya Kashi.
Without the spiritual knowledge man has to wander in
places like Mathura and Kashi.
The sole aim of worship is to get rid ourselves of the
bondage and to attain permanent salvation.
None talks about whether man has been held in
bondage or not. Sometimes, I also watch the channels and have
an opportunity to listen to the religious discourses of other
sages whenever my own programme is not broadcasted. I feel
astonished to find that none of the religious masters throws
light on the spiritual knowledge.
The present day sages spend some of their time in
make-up like the ladies. Real sage is he who has renounciated
the material objects and doesn’t try to make his appearance
attractive. Whole of the society seems to be misled. Who are
the people who are making others indulge in the worship of
ghosts etc.? These are the hypocrites who themselves are
devoid of any spiritual knowledge. I am not denouncing
anyone. I am only calling the spade as spade. They are
performing their activities to earn their living. I am not doing
any job for the sake of money. I did so about 40 years back
when I served in army.
This tendency to amass wealth has proved to be a great
hurdle in the path of worship. This problem has surfaced in


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 29
all the religions. Some are imparting training in the use of
swords, some are imparting it in the use of guns while others
are doing so in the making of bombs. In fact, it is the religion
that has given birth to militancy. That is why Bulle Shah
says—
Thakur Dwarey Thag Ne Basde, Teerthan Vich Dhavdi.
Vich Masitan Posti Basde, Aashiq Rahan Alag.
Cheats have occupied the Thakur dwaras (Hindu
temples); the thieves are to be seen in places of
pilgrimage; idle men have been occupying the mosques
while the loved ones of God keep aloof.
Now, even in the newspapers we find reports of the
involvement of religious places in various bomb explosions
at different places. This extremism has surfaced in all the
religions of the world. Where there is violence, there can be
no spiritual knowledge. The attack targetted on me was also
the handiwork of religious minded people. I had come after
seeking voluntary retirement from the army. The attack on me
was made in a well planned manner. I was surrounded from
all the three possible sides with an intention to prevent me
alongwith my followers from escaping. I was fearless. I could
have created havoc on them if I desired so. This is because
their number was about 5000 while the number of my
followers who had a beforehand information of the designs
of the attackers, was increasing every moment. But, if I had
done so, the people afterwards would have questioned my role
as a true spiritual leader. And those people had come there
after covering a distance of about 3 km. Clearly, they had a
strong backing and this backing was that of politicians. Though
all of them were involved, but none of them has been caught
till now.


30 Sahib Bandgi
The corrupt persons have made their entry into the
politics; wrong elements have assumed the role of Pandits
and so on. Earlier, there was the noble persons who followed
the leaders but now it is just the opposite.
Actually, the controllers of the religious affairs are to
be blamed for all the drawbacks in human behaviour. Many
Peer Babas (Muslim sages) have been surfaced in J & K state.
Wherefrom have they come? Some hoist a flag near some
peepal tree and wrote the word ‘Peer Baba’. After some days,
they construct a room there. This is followed by the beating
of drums on every thursday. People start coming there to
make their offerings. Some begin to talk of the miraculous
powers of the Peer Baba. When ever the officials of the road
construction department comes there, the concerned fellows
telephonically request the local MLA’s to intervene. The
MLA’s who are concerned with votes only, intervenes and asks
the officials not to intervene in the religious affairs.
Sometimes, some persons capture some land along the
national highway and make a sarovar there. They pay money
to the media persons in order to highlight the miraculous
significance of that sarovar. The people from all over the
country begin to pour in large number to get rid of their
different ailments and problems. All this is nothing but a sheer
proof of ignorance.
Sometimes back, 4-5 white snakes (taken by the
Hindus as a diety) surfaced at Naugram (in Jammu) alongwith
a frog. There are 8000 kinds of snakes in the world out of
which 5200 kinds are in India alone. About 80-90% snakes
don’t have poison in them. Only in rare cases man bitten by a
snake suffers death. It is better to take the person bitten by a
snake to the hospital instead of taking him to those posing


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 31
to be expert in curing such patients with the power of mantras
(incantation).
I know many drum beaters. They are persons of loose
character. The misled persons go to such places to offer
some prasad (eatables offered in the name of such Peers or
Babas) on each sunday. Once I assigned to Mr. Ram Lal, a
headmaster, the duty to remain at the place of a Peer Baba
for the whole day. I asked him to note the number of the
Hindus and the Muslims visiting there. You will be surprised
to know that 95% of the people were Hindus whereas only
5% of them were Muslims. It clearly shows that we are more
misled than others.
Now let’s talk of Naugram. People began to make
offerings of money, coconut and other such like things. Frog
and rats are the favourite dish of the snakes. This is because
they eat their prey by swallowing and the frogs and rats, due
to their having less number of bones, can be swallowed easily.
Here the frog was big and it was not easy for the snakes to
swallow it. The frog also couldn’t do any harm to the snakes.
So they remained there together. Thus there was nothing
miraculous about it. You can watch for yourself the fact that
both, a dog and a cat are afraid of each other. Same is the case
of a dog and a monkey.
The local transport operaters also made full use of the
opportunity by exploiting the sentiments of the innocent
people. The Rehdi walas there also began to tell the people
about the fictitious miracles related to such places. This
drama continued for a period of about two months. When the
reality began to dawn, the fellows (some Thakurs) of
Naugram ran away with the snakes that were, in fact, their
pets.


32 Sahib Bandgi
That is to say, the hypocrites have badly misled the
innocent people by making them turn outward instead of
turning inward. Kabir Sahib says—
Moh Ko Kahan Dhundhe Re Bandey,
Main To Tere Pass Mein.
O Man! Where are you searching me? I reside within
you.
All seem to be engrossed in only two kinds of
worship—the Sargun and the Nirgun. In Nirgun form of
worship, it is supposed that God is within us. But, a majority
of those engrossed in this kind of worship are committing
acts of sin and forgery. Further, this kind of worship also has
its limits upto Niranjan only. Such gurus appoint one of their
own family members as their next successor well before the
time of their departure from the world. But, the real holy
saints have never done so. Nirgun worship revolves round the
five postures that can in no way help one in attaining
permanent salvation. This is because these don’t possess the
power to release us from the bondages we have been held in.
Moreover, we have not been able to understand the real
concept of worship. We have taken it simply as a fair where
many items including singing, dancing, etc. are presented and
the devotees also find an opportunity to take part in dance.
Whenever we talk of salvation, we mean to talk about the
salvation of the soul. We are not against any religion. We
differ from them in one respect only and that is we talk about
Param Purush instead of Kaal Niranjan, as the ultimate reality.
The soul is immortal and this physical body of ours
is nothing but an illusion.
None of the qualities of this body resembles that of
the soul. Vasudev Krishan said to Arjun, “O Arjun! you and I


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 33
have taken countless births. The only difference is that I
remember all of them whereas you have no knowledge of
them.” Just as we throw away our old clothes and wear the
new ones, the soul also leaves the old body and adopts some
new one. The soul is beyond the five elements. If the body
doesn’t receive food, it will perish but nothing will happen
to the soul. None in this world knows of the body his soul
had adopted as an abode earlier. None knows his real identity.
Assuming of various yunies (species of living beings) by the
soul is troublesome and painful. If the soul is never born, then
who is it that is taking birth? The soul has been lost
somewhere in the body. There is a need to know the identity
of the power that has prevented us from knowing about our
soul. The virtues of soul are not to be found in any man.
Instead, it is the vices like lust, anger etc. that are to be found
in everyone.
The soul neither takes birth nor dies. Moreover, it has
no relations of any kind and is free from the vices like lust,
anger etc. Then the question arises as to wherefrom have these
vices surfaced. If the soul is an embodiment of eternal joys
and pleasures, then what is the reason behind the sorrows and
sufferings of man. Though the soul is flawless, yet it is being
made to do all sorts of works. It clearly shows that there is
some devil force within us that has held the soul in its grip
and is making it dance to its tune. This devil force is the
controller of all of our activities.
It has rightly been said—
Mann He Niranjan Sabaey Nachaye.
Mind itself is Niranjan that is making all of us dance to
its tune.
The soul has nothing to do with desires. It is Kabir
Sahib who talked of spiritual knowledge.


34 Sahib Bandgi
Aatam Gyan Bina Narr Bhatke, Kya Mathura Kya Kashi.
Without the spiritual knowledge, man has to wander in
places like Mathura and Kashi etc.
The sole purpose of blessing with ‘Naam’ is to separate
the soul from mind and to concentrate it at one point thereby
saving it from further exploitation at the hands of the latter.
This is because none can, on his own, gain a victory over
mind by any possible means. Doing so, I have made the
identity of my disciples altogether different from the rest of
the world.
Kaag Palat Hansa Kar Deena, Karat Na Lagi Baar.
Blessing with ‘Naam’ means to turn a crow-like nature
into that of a swan.
After this, the devotee begins to feel the presence of
some Super-Power that remains at all the times with him and
makes him alert whenever, under the impulse of mind, he
thinks of doing some wrong act as before. That is why I say—
That the thing which I possess, is not to be found
anywhere else in the universe. I say so with firm faith
and not out of ego.
Preetam Ko Patiya Likhun, Jo Kahun Basey Videsh.
Tann Mein Mann Mein Nayan Mein, Vako Kaun Aadesh.
I would think of writing to my loved one if he were in
some foreign land. Since he is very much present within
my body, mind and eyes, I have nothing to fear from.
The shadow leaves us in darkness but the power of
Sahib will never leave us. It will act as our saviour at all the times.

### “A Pure Heart” – The Abode

### Of Param Purush

Kabir Sahib says—
Saach Barabar Tapp Nahin, Jhooth Barabar Paap.
Jakey Hirdey Saach Hai, Ta Ke Hirdey Aap.
No kind of worship can match truth while no kind of sin
can be considered greater than falsehood. Param Purush
has His abode in a heart that is filled with truth and truth
alone.
There is a great power inherent in truth. Goswami Tulsi Dass
has also said so.
Satya Samaan Dharam Nahin Aana.
Agam Nigam Puraan Bakhana.
There is no other religion equivalent to that of truth. The
Vedas and the Shastras also say the same.
Even the God has been called as truth. In fact, truth is
God. Now the question arises as to what is the form and face
of truth. If truth is the greatest kind of worship, then why
shouldn’t we make it a part of our lives. If we dive deep in
the valley of truth, we shall directly get absorbed in God. But
the deeper meaning of truth involves in use of truthful
eatables, truthful behaviour etc. also, apart from simply
speaking of it. These are, so to say, the main forms of truth.

```
35
```

36 Sahib Bandgi
All our negative thinking and imagination can’t be included
in the category of truth. Only present time can be taken as
truth. In Gita as well, Lord Krishan has said, “Arjun! the past
has lost its value; the future is uncertain and so none of these
can be taken as truth. As such, you should learn to live in the
present, which alone is truth.”
A great secret of knowledge is hidden in the present
which is the only truth. It will make you move closer to the
realisation of your soul.
And if you want to live in the present, stop thinking
about the past as well as of the future. This thinking activity
is related to mind alone. If you think about the past or the
future, you will find yourself there. Living in the present
implies to live in the present alone for all practical purposes
and that too with full concentration. It will enable you to have
the realisation of your soul. It is really a wonder to find that
the highly intellectual being has failed to understand
spiritualism. Our religious scriptures say that God is within
us. But, the question arises as to why has man wasted so much
time in realising this fact.
Further, man has wasted a lot of time in knowing as
to why God is so far away from him. Though all of us know
that we are in bondage, yet none is trying to know and
understand bondage. We find the waves rising in the sea but
these rise due to the impact of air but not due to any effort
on the part of the sea that is stable. Likewise, the soul is
stable but the different kinds of waves rising from within our
body are due to the activities of mind alone. The soul has
nothing to do with all this.
Kehat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Jagat Bana Hai Mann Se.
Kabir Sahib says that the existence of whole of the
universe is due to the mind alone.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 37
We need to think as to why we have not succeeded in
moving closer to our soul so far and which is that force who
has prevented us from doing so. We have also to think as to
whether we can realise our soul through the means we have
been adopting for this purpose.
There is a need to understand the appearance and form
of the soul. It is a fact that the soul to be found in every being
is the same. The next thing to think over is the nature of
relation that the soul has with the bondage. We have also to
think as to whether it can really be held in bondage. At least,
one good thing to note is that all of us, in one way or the
other, have recognised that the soul is in some kind of
bondage. But the knowledge about the nature of bondage of
this very power that has held it in bondage is very much
necessary if we want to get rid of from such bondages.
None in bondage can feel joys and pleasures. It is
cruel to keep any living being in bondage. Some put the birds
in cages, give them a good diet and think they will be feeling
themselves comfortable. But actually this is not so. How will
you react if someone places you in a closed room and offers
you milk, cream, sweets and other such like eatables! Certainly
you would try your best to free yourself of this bondage. Even
after possessing the desired comforts and material objects
of the world, one can’t feel satisfied. Our soul is not made
out of the five material elements (earth, water, fire, air and
sky). As such, these can’t even touch it. Moreover, all these
five elements are perishable whereas the soul is immortal.
So it is quite clear that none can do any harm to it. Now the
question arises as to how our soul is so safe and strong. The
simple answer to this is the fact that it is a part of Param
Purush. Goswami ji has said—


38 Sahib Bandgi
Ishwar Ansh Jeev Avinashi, Chetan Amal Sahaj Sukhrasi.
Jiva is immortal as it is a part of God.
As the soul is a part of Param Purush, it is but natural
for it to have the traits similar to that of the latter. We see
that the young one of a goat resembles the goat while that of
a man resembles man. This is again due to the fact that each
of them is a part of its respective parents. The soul is pure
and flawless and always remains in a blissful state because
all these are the traits of Param Purush Himself who is the
ocean of overwhelming love, eternal joy and bliss. By joy and
bliss we mean the state that is away from all sorts of worries,
fears and flaws like lust, anger, greed, attachment and ego.
In our normal life, often we feel pleasure on taking
some desired food or thing. But the pleasure departs soon
after. This is because the continuous use of these pleasure
giving substances makes us feel bored and we begin to desire
for a change. That is to say, these material things can’t give
us permanent bliss. But where has the permanent bliss of the
soul gone? Let’s think over it.
If we place a basket of flowers at some place and also
place another one of dirt and filth near it, we shall begin to
realise that the foul smell has turned somewhat unbearable.
Likewise, the soul is pure and flawless and has eternal joys
and pleasures in it but its association with the dirty and
deceitful mind has veiled its traits. It’s pleasures are being
misused. We must know that we can derive pleasures from
anything we concentrate at. It means concentration is
pleasureful. We derive pleasure from a thing we love. A liar
derives pleasure from telling lies, a criminal does the same
from his criminal activities etc.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 39
Kabir Mann To Ek Hai, Bhave Jahan Lagaye.
Bhave Guru Ki Bhakti Kar, Bhave Vishaey Kamaye.
Kabir Sahib says that mind is a single entity which can
be turned anywhere one likes.
One can turn it to the worship of a guru or to some
wrongful activities, as per one’s desires.
But, our mind is not stable. Often we hear some fellow
telling his beloved that he won’t be able to survive without
her but the next moment he begins to hate her for one or the
other reason. Also, we find different nature of different
persons. There are two reasons behind it.

1. Different aims.
2. Different circumstances.
    Why do we have different aims? Our individuality is
made out of 2 things—our contacts and the environment—
and it is this thing that makes our individuality different. For
example, a village dweller roams about in the village lanes
who has his concentration at his fields. So his individuality
develops into that of a farmer. The soul has nothing to do with
it. A soldier has a different individuality. He has to keep his
body healthy and strong in order to face the enemy. His
thinking will also develop along the same lines. So, inspite
of having the same soul, there is a lot of difference in their
individuality. So clearly, neither it is the body nor the
individuality that can be taken as the soul. There can be some
flaws in individual behaviour. Someone may be rash, someone
may be peaceful and calm while some other fellow can have
a thoughtful nature. Moreover, our individuality has vices like
lust, anger, greed etc. that have not even a distant connection
with the soul that is totally pure and flawless. The presence
of these vices in everyone clearly shows that we have not been
able to achieve soul realisation.


40 Sahib Bandgi
Kabir Sahib says that a devotee should care for the true
‘Naam’ alone. After all, what do the recitation of holy Naam
and concentration at the guru imply? What is their
significance? What benefit can these give to our mind that,
otherwise, keeps us engrossed in one or the other thought.
Moreover, it brings before us the picture related to that
thought which diverts our attention accordingly.
Tann Thir Mann Thir Vachan Thir, Surat Nirat Thir Hoye.
Kahey Kabir Ta Palak Ko, Kalap Na Pavey Koye.
Kabir Sahib says that when our body, mind, thought,
surati and nirati (the two forms of a soul) become stable
for a moment even, we can attain soul realisation at that
very moment.
All the organisations and religions talk of concentration,
though it is a fact that not many of them are able to understand
it. After all, what is the need of concentration?
It is the concentration itself that is our soul. Moreover,
there is need to know that it is not only the source of energy
but the very recognition of soul as well. It has awareness in
it that is needed to fix it firmly. Kabir Sahib has said—
Surat Nirat Thir Hoye......
When Surati and Nirati (the two forms, of soul) become
stable....
Now the question arises as to how we can achieve this
absolute concentration. Any sort of mental activity is bound
to disturb it. So, first of all, there is need to make the body
stable. There is a great secret inherent in it. Next comes the
question of making the mind stable.
There are four states of our mind (mind, intellect,
memory and action). It is just like the three states of water
namely solid, liquid and gas. Our mind remains at all the times


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 41
in a state of activity. Just as awareness is the nature of the
soul, heat and light are the nature of fire (even the fire
produced by burning the sandal wood gives heat) and coolness
is the nature of water, the nature of mind is to remain
engrossed in one or the other mental activity like making
some or the other desire, taking decisions and remembering.
Related to its four states, four kinds of activities are being
performed by our mind. The act of making desire is called
as mind; the act of taking some decision is called as intellect;
the act of recollecting is called as memory whereas the actual
performance of some activity is called as action. That is why
it is difficult to keep it under control.
All of us agree that we have been entrapped by the
combination of Mann-Maya (mind-body) though it is a
separate thing that we have not been giving a serious thought
to it. Actually Mind and Body don’t give any opportunity to
man to understand their real designs. Even a person with all
sorts of dirty habits has some degree of bliss and purity within
him. It must be noted that our mind cannot, on its own, do
any sort of activity. All the energy needed for the purpose is
supplied by the soul. Without this energy, our body can’t make
any movement to satisfy any desire of mind. Even making of
desire and taking of the decision depend solely on this very
energy. Suppose the mind makes a desire to construct two
rooms. The intellect will play its part only if the soul supplies
the needed energy. That is to say, the mind needs some energy
for its survival which he is deriving from the soul by keeping
it in a state of ignorance.
If we sit in meditation, the mind will try to disturb us
by all possible means. At this time, the devotee should ignore
its dictates but should think that he is not a body but a soul.


42 Sahib Bandgi
At this, the mind will become helpless.
Some say, God did a cruel job by sending man to the
universe. But, the truth is that you are not at all in the universe
in the real sense. I’ll throw light on it only to the extent it
can serve your purpose. If I speak about soul realisation in
detail, you won’t be able to understand it. You should realise
that it is not a child’s play to control the mind. While in
meditation, never dream of soaring high or seeing dazzling
light and so on. Kabir Sahib says—
Na Kahun Gaya Na Kahun Aaya.
Neither I went to any place nor I came back from one
such.
Where has the concentration to be fixed? Some people
talk about such like things simply to mislead others. These
are the hurdles created by mind. I am presenting spiritualism
in its basic form. I feel sad to find that, spiritualism has got
polluted. Lest something in favour of Niranjan may find place
in our books, I myself go through these. In some cases, I had
to burn down many books worth lac of rupees. That is why I
don’t allow anyone to speak on my behalf. I have no feeling
of ill-will for anyone but the devotees can be misled. This
mind is very powerful. On one hand, it is the greatest
worshipper while on the other hand, it is our greatest enemy
as well.
Its limits extend beyond shunya and can reach upto
Mahashunya. This Mahashunya is not an ordinary place. The
universe we are living in, is not so vast. Crores and crores of
universes can be accommodated in this Mahashunya. Mind has
its presence in each of these. At any place and at any time, it
can get anything done as per its desire. Sometimes, it appears
calm and peaceful while at other times it assumes a fearful


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 43
form. It is present in all the other Lok’s—be it Heaven, Brahm
Lok, Pitar Lok (abode of deceased forefathers) etc.. It makes
its presence felt in all the four kinds of salvations. That is
why Kabir Sahib has said
Teen Lok Mein Mann He Viraji.
Tahin Na Cheenat Pandit Qazi.
The mind is present in all the 3 Lok’s. Even great Pandits
(Hindu priests) and Qazis (Muslim priests) have not been
able to have a glimpse of it.
It doesn’t perish altogether though, sometimes, it
appears as dead. Though it can make everyone dance to its
tune, yet there is one place where it can’t enter and that place
is Maansarovar. The soul reaches that ocean of concentration
after crossing the 7 Lok’s of Maha-Shunya but, the mind can’t
dare to enter that place as a result of the curse hurled on it
by Param Purush. It is Satguru alone who can take the soul
of his disciple to the abode of Param Purush.
I am thinking of writing a book in which I’ll give
description of Trikuti, Maansarovar etc. alongwith the
difficulties one can face in such places.
It is the mind alone that keeps you away from your
trueself. Even the scientific facts disclose that none but our
mind is our real enemy. Kabir Sahib says—
Mann He Niranjan Sabaey Nachaye.
Mind itself is Kaal Niranjan that makes everyone dance
to its tune.
Our soul obeys its dictates like a faithful servant. Our
mind is like a butcher. It is not easy to go beyond its limit.
People are speaking all that lies within its limit but my aim
is to present spiritualism in its real and true form. After
making the mind stable, there is a need to make our Surati as
well as Nirati stable.


44 Sahib Bandgi
In this state, all the different kinds of air begin to enter
into Sushumna and as a result of it, the phlegm condensed
therein begins to melt. Niranjan has kept all this as a guarded
secret.
Though the world is talking about Sushumna, yet none
seems to be clear about it.
Kirkil is the air that is present in our nostrils. Even
this will begin to flow. Even the Dev Dutt air that is present
in our eye-lashes, will begin to flow towards the Sushumna.
Then no part of the body will function. In fact, all the ten
kinds of air will begin to flow and no part of our body will
be able to make any movement. While lifting a sack, we use
not only the power of our fingers but also that of our legs as
well as back. So, it is the force exerted by all the ten kinds
of air that makes the Sushumna open by removing the hurdles
of phlegm. Above the Sushumna, resides our mind.
Thus the melting of phlegm by the force of airs helps
us in making our Surati and Nirati (the two forms, of soul)
stable. Today, none is talking about spiritualism. All have
confined themselves upto the act of dancing and singing alone.
This can in no way be called as spiritualism. The people are
moving far from spiritualism.
As long as we are in the dream state, our mind has full
awareness whereas our soul has less amount of it. In the
waking state, both the mind as well as the soul have equal
amount of awareness. In the Turiya state, the soul has greater
awareness as compared to our mind whereas in Turiyateet
state, the soul gains much more awareness than our mind
which becomes almost dead.
It is only the Maha Yogeshwars who could reach this
state. But, even they couldn’t go beyond it. Kabir Sahib says—


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 45
Kewal Gyan Kabir Ka, Koi Birle Jann Jana.
Only some rare fellow can understand the knowledge and
philosophy of Kabir Sahib.
Our mind enjoy the joys and pleasures of the soul. We
can see only that which it presents before us.
When you move near truth, you move near God. When
you succeed in realising your soul, everything in the world
will begin to appear to you as a mere farce. At that time, the
worldly people will take you as an insane fellow. This is
because all the people here are themselves insane.
Dharam Dassji said to Kabir Sahib, “Can man cross the
limit of mind on his own or he has to depend on the support
of someone else for this.” He further requested him to tell
him whether he could achieve soul realisation on his own or
through his (Kabir Sahib) blessings.
Different organisation present different approaches
for achieving soul realisation. Some lay stress on the
performance of noble deeds for this purpose. But Goswami
Tulsi Dassji says—
Yeh Sab Sadhan Se Na Hoyi,
Tumhari Kripa Paye Koi Koi.
One can’t achieve it on one’s own. One can do so only
by your blessings.
It is clear that the blessings and grace of the Satguru
have a miraculous power.
Many intellectuals can be seen roaming about. They
won’t agree to the views of the holy saints. This is because
they haven’t tried to go deep to understand the Sant Mat.
Anyone who cares for his body alone, falls in the category
of ignorants. Kabir Sahib says—


46 Sahib Bandgi
Ek Na Bhoola, Do Na Bhoole, Jo Hai Snatan Soyi Bhoola.
Not only one or two but, all those engrossed in Sargun
or Nirgun forms of worship seem to be misled.
Remember! none can move into the inner world
without the support of some true Guru. Our own efforts in
this regard can land us in unthinkable troubles. Sometimes, I
ask the village women as to who fed their children when they
were in their womb. In reply, they say that it was God who
did so. Then I ask them where was it passing its urine. In reply
they say, “Gurudev, you can have better knowledge of it.”
The mother nurtures the child. A nerve connecting the
two helps in the growth of the child by providing it the needed
nutrients. Today, the medical science has made much
progress. One can know of the child’s condition at any
moment during the period of pregnancy. In olden times, it was
difficult to do so. Often, the death of the child in the womb
proved dangerous for the mother.
So the mother feeds the child in the womb as well.
The food taken by her changes into blood that reaches it
through the connecting nerve. Unlike olden times, today it
has become possible to transmit the diet through an injection
as well.
This has helped in saving the people from death. After
birth, the child begins to feed on milk. The mother does so
by seating it in her lap but it is the child who has to make an
effort to suck the milk from her nipples. And the power to
do so is also provided by the mother during the period of her
pregnancy. So it is clear that the entire role in this process
is played by the mother. The child, so to say, surrenders
before her completely. Kabir Sahib says—


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 47
Khaak Ho Guru Ke Charan Mein, To Tujhe Manzil Miley.
If you want to reach your destination, you will have to
make total surrender before your guru.
But, one can think as to what is the need, after all, for
subordinating oneself to the guru. Whole of the spiritualism
is turning round this very point. Normally, all our activities
are done at the instance of the mind.
Mita De Apni Hasti Ko, Jo Kuch Martba Chahey.
Ki Dana Khaak Mein Mil Ke, Guley Gulzar Hota Hai.
If you want to attain some status, you will have to crush
your ego. A grain can sprout into a flower only after
mixing with the earth.
We should remember that a Satguru is beyond the
bondages of mind. He can guide us as to how we can cross
the worldly ocean. In our normal life also, we see that only
an expert swimmer can teach others how to swim and some
expert in the field of education can impart education to others.
That is to say, one can achieve some knowledge only when
one seeks the guidance of some expert in the field. For this,
one has to behave as a disciple.
Bin Satguru Bachey Nahin, Koi Kotin Karey Upaey.
However hard one may try, one can’t achieve proper
knowledge without the guidance of Satguru.
In fact, the Satguru gives a wonderful thing to the
disciple while blessing him with bodiless ‘Naam’. None can
challenge the mind without this bodiless ‘Naam’.
One has to stumble here and there as long as one
remains in ignorance and in such circumstances, one takes
even the light of a candle as a source of support. Though, the
horse possesses a great power, yet it can be brought under
control by using reins. Likewise, the power of Satguru will


48 Sahib Bandgi
enable you to rein even the all powerful mind.
Mann He Niranjan Sabaey Nachayi.
Naam Hoey To Maath Navayi.
This mind is Niranjan itself. It makes all dance to its tune
but bows down to him who is blessed with ‘Naam’.
Throwing light in the field of spiritualism means to
separate the soul from mind into which it has got absorbed
and to seat it at a place higher than that of mind. Any attempt
to do so without any guidance would be equivalent to just
fighting with one’s own shadow.
Naam Hoey To Maath Navaye.
The mind bow down before a devotee who is blessed with
bodiless ‘Naam’.
While blessing a devotee with ‘Naam’, I separate his
soul from his mind. The soul of such a devotee gains
awareness. Sometimes, the mind can gain upper hand. If such
a thing happens, it will be on account of your own fault. If
you continue to receive the flow of energy from the guru
continuously, your mind won’t be able to regain control over
you. Even if it succeeds, the alive power standing behind you
will come to your rescue. If you are going to suffer defeat,
it will move away after placing you in a victorious state. Even
in the midst of some great misfortune, you will realise as if
some power had come to your rescue. This act on the part of
Param Purush is meant only to assure you of His presence
with you. This power never lets you remain helpless.
Guru Samrath Jihi Sarr Khadey, Kamee Kahu Ko Dass.
Ridhi Sidhi Sewa Karey, Mukti Na Chhodey Sath.
He who has the backing of a perfect guru with him, will
feel no shortage of any kind. All sorts of miraculous
powers will remain with him. Moreover, there will be
a total guarantee of salvation.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 49
The guidance of a guru is also needed to keep the
negative thoughts at an arm’s length.
Mujhe Hai Kaam Satguru Se,
Jagat Roothe To Roothan De.
I am only concerned with my Satguru alone. I have nothing
to bother about the disregard, the world shows for me.
The wife of one of my disciple in Gorakhpur developed
some mental disorder. His daughter’s marriage was going to
take place. The material had been collected. His wife was very
much worried about the safety of the material. This is because
in Gorakhpur many incidents of theft takes place. As a result,
she became mentally disturbed. Often we feel pain in
different parts of our body. It is not a serious matter. Likewise,
the brain is also a part of our body and it can develop any
problem. She began to dance. Her husband had been putting
up a brave fight against the hypocrites. All began to make a
fun of him. They also said, “He has reaped the punishment
for ignoring his gods and taking the shelter of Sahib Bandgi,
instead.” They said so simply to instil in others a feeling of
fear so that they may not turn to Sahib Bandgi organisation. I
advised him to show her to some doctor. He didn’t pay any
heed to my advice and as a result, the condition of the lady
worsoned further. Our opponents were pleased to see all this.
In another case, some persons brought a mentally disturbed
person to me. I asked them to show him to some doctor. The
persons left the fellow there and slipped away.
The fellow moved out of the Ashram and set out on
foot. A vehicle was passing that way. The fellow struck against
it and died. I sent my vehicle with a sum of Rs. 500/- to his
family members for his cremation. The hypocrites who were


50 Sahib Bandgi
feeling a downfall in their business of befooling the people,
exploited the situation to the extent they could. As ill-luck
would have it, a vehicle fell down from a height of about 250
feet and as a result, 14 persons lost their lives while many
others were critically wounded. However, one of my disciple
who was also among the passengers, remained safe and sound.
Nothing happened to him. Now, I had to hold a satsang there.
I was sad at the death of so many people. We don’t denounce
the gods and the goddesses. We worship 14 kinds of gods.
Upenderji is the god of the feet. We say that none should take
them along any wrong path. Vishnuji is the god of belly. We
say that none should put any wrong thing in it. This is called
as the real worship.
So I was telling about that lady. When I was
telephonically informed by her husband about her
deteriorating condition, I asked him to take her to the hospital.
The lady couldn’t survive but before her death she said, “I am
going to Amarlok. Take me seriously. I have recovered.” She
breathed her last. Her husband was surprised to hear all this.
He came to me and narrated the whole incidence. He
also told me that I asked him not to worry and advised him
not to remarry. When someone asked him why he was still
associated with Sahib Bandgi organisation, he replied, “My
wife has attained salvation and I too want to do so.”
The worldly people are not on good terms with us as
we don’t say what others have been saying for ages together.
Instead of dyeing ourselves in the worldly colour, we want
to dye the worldly people in our own colour. A lady offered
to me a flute. Just think! have I to play on the flute? Another
one offered me a Mukut (crown). Some others offered
Shervani, shoes like those of Rana Partap and a stick. How


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 51
can I dye others in my own colour by wearing all these things?
I gave each of these things to the needy fellows.
So I was talking about total surrender which implies
surrendering of the body, mind and wealth. The rare thing that
the Satguru gives you is powerful enough to bind your mind
and the regular vision of the Satguru gives the unending
source of energy that can help the soul maintain its dominant
position.
That is why a great significance has been attached to
the holy sight of the Satguru.

```
Koi Sargun Mein Reejh Raha, Koi Nirgun Thaehraye.
Dadu Atpat Chaal Kabir Ki, Mujhse Kahi Na Jaye.
Hindu To Hadd Mein Chaley, Musalman Hadd Paar.
Dadu Chaal Kabir Ki, Mujhse Kahi Na Jaye.
Dadu Dayal ji says that people are engaged in Sargun
(with form) or Nirgun (formless) forms of worship &
seems to be satisfied with such worships. But, Kabir
Sahib’s philosophy is altogether different from these
& is indescribable. The Hindus remain within the
limits of shunya whereas the Muslims has there reach
above shunya. But, Kabir Sahib shows the rare path to
be followed which is beyond the reach of both shunya
and maha-shunya creations.
```

52 Sahib Bandgi

### Ultimately, This Body Is

### Bound To Perish

This world is full of stresses and strains. Competitions
and struggles, healthy or unhealthy, are to be seen everywhere.
In fact, this sense of competition is to be found in almost all
the fields of life—be they scientific, academic or other ones.
Even the two children in a home have this feeling of
competition. The religious field also has not remained
untouched. Every organisation and religious sect is trying to
establish its own supremacy. In this way, an attempt is made
to denounce other sects. It is the moral duty of the devotees
to think as to which kind of worship is good for the realisation
of Supreme Lord.
Bhakti Naseni Mukti Ki.
The sole aim of worship is salvation. But the approach
for it has to be real and scientific one. Simply performing of
noble deeds or visiting of holy places and the like is not going
to help in this regard. It must be noted that without having a
proper knowledge of the mind, no purposeful attempt can be
made for the achievement of salvation. A doctor can suggest
some suitable remedy only if he knows the nature of the
disease of the patient and its causes. As such, in hospitals, a
file containing the complete history of the patient’s disease
and the medicines prescribed is kept near his bed. This is done
so as to enable other doctors to do what is right for the
recovery of the patient. The history of the patient’s disease
also helps the doctors to know whether any other member
**52**


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 53
of his family—father or grandfather has been or had been
suffering from the same disease or the patient has caught it
from his place of work or surroundings. These details are
helpful because the same medicine can’t prove affective for
different causes of the disease. Likewise, in the spiritual
field, there is need to understand the true nature of bondage,
its causes, the forces responsible for this bondage and the
suitable means that can help us free ourselves from it. We
also have to think whether we are really in bondage or not.
Everyone of us moves where he likes and does what
he thinks worth doing. So we can say that we are free and not
bound. Some say they are not in any jail and as such are not
in any bondage. It clearly shows that we are in bondage if we
consider from spiritual point of view and are free if we
consider from physical point of view.
A deer takes the shining sand as water and runs
towards it to quench his thirst. Deer becomes sad on finding
no water there and again runs to such other spot. He continues
to do so till he loses its life. We have also to think whether
attempts being made by us for the realisation of God are real
and fruitful or not.
Every human being on earth understands that something
remains behind even after the destruction of the body. This
something is called as soul that moves further to some other
abode. That is to say, it is the soul and not the body that is in
bondage. The Muslims say, “We have to go to Allah.”
When all take the soul as immortal, then how it can
be held in bondage. This question needs a serious thought.
Goswami Tulsi Dass ji has also said, “The soul is a part
of God and doesn’t perish at any time or under any set of


54 Sahib Bandgi
circumstances.” Vashisht Muni also explained to Ram Ji in a
beautiful manner the real nature of soul. The sayings of all
the great religious masters who appeared on this earth in-
between the 14th to 18th century clearly teach us that the soul
as well as God have their existence.
The talk of heaven, hell, Brahm lok etc. clearly
indicates that even after the destruction of the body,
something remains behind and it is this thing that finds its
way in any of these Lok’s. Vasudev Krishan also said to Arjun,
“Our soul leaves one body only to adopt another one as per
its karmas, in a manner one wears new clothes after throwing
away the old ones”. The religious masters associated with
different organisations have talked of 4 kinds of salvations.
But even after attaining any of these salvations, one has to
take birth again. That is to say, these don’t provide permanent
salvation to any one. The salvation for which the holy saints have
talked about is altogether different from these four ones. After
attaining this salvation, one hasn’t to take birth again and again.
There is need to know about the nature of the spiritual
power and the fact that there is no outer source from which
it can be obtained. Its source lies within us. Only through right
way of worship we can be able to awaken this power. People
think they can worship God even while committing acts of
forgery, cheating etc. But, this is nothing but self deception.
Our soul is unrelated to the five material elements. It is
invisible while the material elements are visible. All of us
need food for survival and so, for this purpose, we perform
one or the other kind of job. He who knows that life is not
possible without the blood formed out of food, takes it (food)
without fail while he who doesn’t know of it, also takes it.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 55
Everyone, whether he is literate or illiterate, understands the
significance of food.
The five elements that constitute the material world
are—air, water, earth, fire and sky.
We can see the earth with our own eyes. We carry on
all our movements here. We can feel and see the air. If it were
not visible, it ought to have been formless. Water is also
visible. We use it for drinking cooking, bathing and other
purposes. Fire is also visible. We light it in our homes to
cook our food. That which we see above us like an umbrella,
is not the sky but air itself.
Neelo Rang Hai Vayu Ko, Khatto Isko Swaad.
Peelo Rang Hai Dharti Ko, Meetho Isko Swad.
Shvaet Rang Hai Neer Ko, Kharo Isko Swaad.
The color of air is blue while its taste is sour. The earth
has a yellow colour and a sweet taste while the water
has a white colour and a saltish taste.
Laal Rang Hai Agni Ko, Teekho Charparo Swaad.
The fire has a red colour and a burning taste.
The fifth element is the sky. It has a definite form and
as such can be seen.
Kaalo Rang Hai Aakash Ko, Pheeko Isko Swaad.
The sky has a black colour and is insipid in taste.
The dark matter we see above us, is the sky. About 90%
of our space has dark matter. The darkness we see at night, is
the color of the sky. These five elements can destroy each
other but can do no harm to the soul. According to the holy
saints, the soul is perfect in itself as such, it needs no support
of any kind. The body can perish if it does not get food or if
it strikes against some hard thing but the soul remains
unaffected by it. Neither it needs any kind of food nor any


56 Sahib Bandgi
kind of house to live in. It has neither any beginning nor any
ending and is, no doubt, a rare and wonderful thing.
Our holy scriptures throw a flood of light on it. Now
the question arises as to wherein does it lie within the human
body and what job it has been performing. None seems to have
a perfect knowledge of it. Our body is certainly not our soul.
This is because our body has certain limits and for its very
survival it depends on others. All around us, we see our
parents, grand parents and neighbours departing from the
world after living here for some time. We light their bodies
with fire. There is no need to give any evidence to the fact
that it is the body that has burnt to ashes and not the soul.
The body, including the mind as well, doesn’t seem to have
even any remote resemblance with the soul. The most
important and significant questions that the devotees seek an
answer to are—Who am I and Wherefrom have I come? It is
not easy to find the answer to these questions. If the body is
not the soul, the question arises as to whether in that case it
is the intellect or the mind that can be taken as soul. Very
few people understand the real identity of mind. The body of
every being is made out of the blood of mother and semen
of father. It has to perish one day or the other. Hunger, thirst
etc. are also related to the body alone and the soul has nothing
to do with all this. If we go into deep thinking, we shall find
that we are certainly not the mind. This mind has four forms—
mind, intellect, memory and action. But none of these four
forms can be taken as soul. When this is so, why we are all living
for the body that is bound to perish one day or the other?
Aakhir Ye Tann Khaak Miley Ga,
Kahan Phirat Magruri Mein.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 57
Where are you wandering like an egotist? This body is
bound to perish.
We shall have to move towards the spiritual element.
We have to think about that which remains even after the
destruction of the body.
Dharam Rai Jab Lekha Maange, Kya Mukh Le Ke Jayega.
With what face will you appear before Dharam Rai (The
lord of death) when the latter enquires after your deeds.
It clearly shows that something other than the body
moves ahead. Then why don’t people live for the
emancipation of this ‘something’.
Divas Gavaya Khaye Ke, Raen Gavayi Soye.
Heera Janam Anmol Tha, Kauddi Badley Khoye.
You have spent your days in enjoying eatables and nights
in enjoying sleep. This is nothing short of wasting away
this priceless birth as human.
Kabir Sahib says that it is not the case of one or two
persons who have got misled. All have drowned themselves
in the satisfaction of their bodily needs only and are doing
all sorts of deeds (good or bad) for the sake of it. A soul has
to pass through the cycle of 84 lac yunis in order to reap the
fruit of its deeds.
All our Indries (organs like eyes, tongue etc.) remain
ever active to derive material joys and pleasures. The tongue
doesn’t get satisfied even after eating tasty foods for years
together. The eyes don’t get satisfied even after sighting
pleasant and charming scenes for years together. The kings
and other highly placed persons ever remain entangled in their
lustful activities for years together but never feel satisfied.
The same is true for all other organs as well. The mind
continues to mislead us in order to prevent us from turning


58 Sahib Bandgi
to the worship of Supreme Lord. Water has three different
states—solid, liquid and gas. Though all the three have
different appearances and properties, yet these are chemically
the same. The same is true of the four forms of mind. When
it makes some desire, it is called as mind. Our desire to have
a beautiful house or any other thing is solely related to mind.
This is because the soul has no family and has no need for
any house.
The other form of mind is intellect. We use it to take
decisions. Sometimes, we take a decision to kill someone
while at other times we begin to shower praises on some
other fellow. Such decisions can certainly not be those of the
soul as it is pure and flawless and has nothing to do with the
virtues or flaws of others. It clearly shows that our soul is in
the hands of devil forces. I quote the P.A. of Mr. Reegan, the
ex-president of U.S.A. He remarked that all the people of the
world seemed to be the tools in the hands of some devil force
that has the power to make all of them dance to its tune. Also,
it has even the power to turn all of them in one direction at
one and the same time. He also said that for the time being
that force was taking all of them to destruction. His remark
was considered as the best remark of the year. Kabir Sahib
has since long cautioned us—
Saeeyaad Ke Kaboo Mein Hain Sab Jeev Bicharey.
All the poor jivas are in the grip of the devil hunter.
After all, someone is inciting the jivas of the world
to do all sorts of evil acts. Just as a noble person can’t even
think of harming others, a flawless soul also can’t think so.
Chashm Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashe Ho Rahey.
Try to watch with your inner eyes the plays being enacted
within you.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 59
Spirituality implies to know the enemies hidden within
us. Acts of great plunder are taking place within us. So we
have seen that the activities being performed by our intellect
are totally unrelated to our soul. Next we turn to ‘memory’
that is the third form of mind. It plays a great role. It
continues to tell us all about our family members, friends and
foes. It is also misleading us. The fourth form is ‘Action’
(ego). The actual movement in the direction of fulfilment of
desire is done by it. Like the other three forms, it is also
unrelated to the soul. Now, after knowing about the four
forms of mind, there is a need to know about the role of the
soul in human body.
Aatam Gyan Bina Narr Bhatke, Kya Mathura Kya Kashi.
Without the spiritual knowledge man keeps wandering
in holy places like Mathura and Kashi.
I tell you about the appearance of the soul. This soul
is ‘concentration’. I shall give evidence and shall show how
we can realise it. Goswami Tulsi Dassji has also endorsed this
view.
So our soul is none else but our concentration alone.
It is responsible for all the activities being performed by us.
But, the sad thing to observe is that it does all its activities
under the guidance of mind that has treacherously tied it. The
true spiritual knowledge enables us to know not only the
secrets inherent in our body but also the manner in which the
soul has been tied. Without knowing the bondage, we can’t
make any effort for its emancipation. All the jobs being
performed by us need concentration. Without concentration,
we can’t perform any activity. During satsang, you look at me,
listen to what I say but if your concentration gets diverted,
you won’t be able to either listen to me or to understand what


60 Sahib Bandgi
I say though you would be looking at me with open eyes.
How strange does it sound! Though your physical body
is very much there, yet you won’t be able to do anything. That
is to say, you can’t even see without the support of your soul.
When someone listens to us unattentively, we ask him to
listen attentively. It means our activities of listening,
understanding etc. solely depend on our concentrated
activities which is fully under the control of mind.
Often when you desire to sit in meditation, your
attention gets diverted. The mind diverts your attention to such
worldly activities as you desire to undertake at some future
date and thus keeps you entangled for some time. Such
activities may be related to the construction of one or two
rooms or the future of some child or any other affair that
needs proper planning. And when you open your eyes after
sometime, you find you couldn’t gain anything from
meditation. You never realise for a moment even that without
proper concentration there can be no meditation worth the
name.
Even if the mind doesn’t make any desire, one may
remember the ill-treatment met out to one at the hands of
someone and may indulge in making plans to take revenge.
This act of drowning ourselves in the sea of imaginations like
Sheikh Chilli is not going to prove beneficial in any manner.
Sheikh Chilli worked as a coolie. One rich man asked
him to carry a pitcher of ghee to his residence. Chilli said,
“What wages will you give to me for that?” The rich man said,
“I shall pay one anna (1/16th part of a Rupee).” Chilli
demanded 2 annas. The rich man agreed to it. He was moving
behind Chilli.
Now Chilli got absorbed in day dreaming. He said to


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 61
himself, “I shall buy a hen with these 2 annas. The hen will
hatch young ones. When the young ones grow, I shall set up
a poultary farm. Then I shall sell it to buy a buffalo. When
the young ones of the buffalo will grow young, I shall set up
a dairy form. After selling the dairy farm, I shall set up a
wholesaler’s shop. A large number of customers will be
attracted to the shop. Then I shall marry and have a son. While
I shall be smoking a chilam in the shop, my son will come
with a message from his mother to come home for food. I
shall ask him to go home assuring him to come soon. He will
again come and sit in my lap. I shall ask him to get aside.”
Thinking so, he actually moved his neck. The pitcher full of
ghee fell down. The rich man said, “O Chilli! you have spoiled
whole of my ghee.” Chilli said, “O rich man! you have lost
ghee only whereas I have lost whole of my family.” The rich
man asked him in what way had he suffered. He narrated all
that he had planned to do with the two annas that he had to
receive as wages.
This world is also like the dream of Sheikh Chilli.
People continue to make unrealistic planning and then, in
frustration, remark that they have failed to achieve anything.
All this is the play of mind that can in no way be called as
soul. It is, so to say, our greatest enemy.
Tera Baeri Koi Nahin, Tera Baeri Mann.
It is none else but your mind that is your greatest enemy.
Jeev Ke Sang Mann Kaal Rahai, Agyani Nar Jaanat Nahin.
Ignorant man doesn’t know that death in the form of
mind is, at all the times, hovering over him.
This greatest enemy of ours is making us dance to its
tune for all the 24 hours.
Remember! some dips in some holy river or recitation


62 Sahib Bandgi
of some mantras (sacred words) are not going to help you
free yourself from the bondage of mind. Even noble deeds
or yogic postures or other such activities are not going to
help you attain salvation. This mind did not spare even the
great rishis like Kapil, Shandilya and Parashar who
worshipped hard, but were misled by this mind.
In shastras, we find that one Shringi Rishi reduced his
body to a skeleton through Hatha Yoga. The reason behind it
was that without the formation of blood there can’t be the
production of semen and without the formation of semen, the
lustful desires can easily be kept under control. But after
some time, he fell under the influence of a prostitute.
It is a clear indication of the fact that none can, on his
own, attain salvation.
Can we expect from a man in this Kalyug to perform
hard worship in a manner Vyas ji or Parasharji did. If those
noble beings couldn’t free themselves from the cycle of
births and deaths, how can we expect a man in this Kalyug
who consumes urea infested food, to do so. The mind,
through its powerful agents like Kaam (lust), Krodh (anger),
etc. is making us dance like puppets.
Kaam Prabal Ati Bhayankar, Mahadarun Kaal.
Gann Gandharv Yaksh Kinnar, Sabaey Keen Behal.
This lust is a great monstrous. It is fearful like Kaal
itself. It has rendered senseless all—be they Gann,
Gandharv, Yaksh or Kinnar (different sections of human
beings).
Kaam Se Adhik Krodh Parachanda.
Anger is worse than lust even.
Brahmaji is the creator of the universe. The fire of
anger polluted his mind to such an extent that he killed his


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 63
six sons by hurling a curse on them. When this fire of anger
overpowers Shivji, he makes whole of the world perish. Under
its spell, Durvasa Rishi, the guru of Lord Krishan, annihilated
56 Koti (10 million) Yadavs (a community) by hurling a curse
on them while Sankadi turned the two gate keepers—Jaya and
Vijay into devils by hurling a curse. In such circumstances
what can we say about a common man.
This soul has been held in many chains and none else
but Supreme Lord Himself can free it from these. Even in
normal life, we see that the eyes turn red in rage.
Bura Lobh Te Aur Na Koyi.
But greed is the most dangerous of all the vices.
All the acts of sin are the result of greed alone. It is,
so to say, the father of sin. Great yogis, jangams and highly
learned persons couldn’t escape from its grip. Even Narad
Muni couldn’t escape from it. In our normal life we see that
even a millionaire has his eye on the wealth of others. Kabir
Sahib says—
Sai Itna Deejiye, Ja Mein Kutumb Samaye.
Main Bhi Bhukha Na Rahun, Sadhu Na Bhukha Jaye.
O Param Purush! give me only as much as is sufficient
to support the family. Neither me nor any sage should
go hungry.
It is the greed alone that instigates us to commit sins.
Next comes the ego. This is no less a vice than greed. We
see people boasting of their wealth, sons and the like. This
is nothing but bondage. None tries to think of it. Some think
they will achieve salvation simply by listening to what is
contained in Shastras and Puranas (holy scriptures of the
Hindus) but they forget that the stories in these holy
scriptures are about the sages who, in their life time, danced


64 Sahib Bandgi
to the tunes of mind. In fact, all fall within the limits of mind.
Mann Hanse Mann Roye, Mann Jage Mann Soye.
Mann Ka Hai Vyovhar Kabira, Mann Ka Hai Vyovhar.
It is the nature of mind to laugh, to weep, to be awake
and to sleep.
Even great intellectuals have not been able to
understand it. I often ask people not to judge any sage from
his clothes, family background, wealth and the like. If you
judge a sage from his wealth, it will be a very wrong
judgement. Was king Sikander a sage? A sage should be judged
only from the degree of control he has attained over his mind.
If he seems to be engrossed in enjoying the pleasures related
to the Indries (organs), he can in no case be called as a sage.
From the etheric point of view, he can’t be called a sage if
he is under the dominance of lust, anger and the like.
When a wrestler fights with his opponent, he catches
first the hands of the latter before catching his legs or other
organs. This is because the hands are more powerful than the
legs etc. Lust, anger and the like are the hands of mind while
the organs are its legs. So a sage should, at first, control his
lust, anger and the like before controlling his organs. I am
not against education. But, how can the education that is being
imparted to us, help in the spiritual field. Some even say that
all it depends on luck. But, this is far from truth. Kabir Sahib
says that neither has anyone been able to know the mind nor
shall he be able to find an opportunity to escape from it. The
holy saints say that it is the Satguru alone who has the power
to take us away from the limits of mind. Today, man has
accepted this view but has not been able to understand as to
what kind of virtues should a Guru possess. At present, there
are about 60 lac registered Gurus. Since the Shastras have


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 65
described the necessity of a Guru for salvation, there has been
a mad race for achieving, so to say, the status of a Guru.
A provision store can meet the basic necessities of our
homes, so we find a number of such shops in almost every
street. Likewise, since man has recognised the necessity of
a Guru, he is on the look out for some perfect Satguru.
Kabir Sahib has described in detail the virtues of a
really true Guru. He says that a large number of Gurus can
be seen wandering about simply to satisfy their self interest.
They can in no way help us attain salvation. He says that a
devotee who seeks the shelter of some guru without knowing
his virtues, can’t hope to attain salvation. According to Kabir
Sahib, the virtues of a perfect Satguru are—
1. Nirvasna : That is to say, he should be free from lustful
thoughts. If he is not a Brahmchari (unmarried), he should be
a sanyasi (one who has renounced the world).

2. Nirbandhan : That is to say, he should be free from any
sort of bondage.
Ja Ka Guru Hai Grahi, Chela Grahi Hoye.
Keech Keech Ke Dhovte, Daag Na Chhute Koye.
The disciple of a family holder guru will also be a family
holder. Such a guru as himself is entangled in the mayaic
mesh, can never be expected to help his disciples attain
salvation. The stains of mud can’t be washed with mud
itself.
    The third virtue is—
Sargrahi : That is to say, he should depend on his own
earnings and should, in no case, beg from others in the form
of donations or other charities.
Maangan Maran Samaan Hai, Mat Koi Maango Bheekh.
Maangan Te Marna Bhala, Satguru Dete Seekh.


66 Sahib Bandgi
None should beg from others as begging is just like
dying. According to the Satguru, it is better to die than
beg.
Sometimes, people bother me as well. I ask them to
tell me whether one should beg money from the gurus or
should seek their blessings. If I give money to some disciple,
I tell him that I won’t ask for the return of it as my guruji has
advised me to avoid dealings of money with the disciples. He
has also said that in case I give money to some disciple, I
shouldn’t ask for the return of it as the person concerned will
feel ashamed to show his face again. But, still one does so
in one’s life time. This begging is of three kinds—
Ist one is to beg inwardly without speaking.
There was a man in our village. He used to take food
from the houses of others. He used to come without having
any food at home and didn’t go without having it. But, as per
his principle, he didn’t take food at the same house daily. He
stayed at every house he visited even upto 4 p.m if the family
members didn’t take food before that. Though everyone asked
him as a matter of formality sake to have food, yet he never
refused to do so. And whole of the village knew that he won’t
go without having food. But as per his nature, he never asked
anyone to give him food. This is called as mental begging.
2nd one is begging by speaking while the 3rd one is
to sit like an obstinate fellow with a determination to leave
the place only after getting something. This is called as Tamas
type of begging. And what should a Guru, who doesn’t like
any of these three kinds of begging, do. Some say, he should
accept that which one offers at his feet. But the question
arises as to what for should the guru accept the same as well.
If a guru has to live on his own earnings, what is the need to


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 67
accept anything from others?
People come to me from far off places like Gonda,
Patna etc. They have to be provided with food and also with
shelter if they choose to stay there. I can’t ask them to bring
all such things alongwith them. I was born in a good family. I
have been blessing the devotees with Naam for the past 40
years and during all these years I have never asked for
anything from any one. Would I ask for it at this stage? I have
never made any appeal on my website even for collecting
donations. This is also an act of begging. The people collect
donations and then talk of God. We oppose all this. Also,
during the performance of a sacrifice (yajya), the yajmans
(hosts) are made to pay some money. This is nothing but a
sort of business. We are not calling them as dacoits but we
shall have to remain vigilant and shall have to seek some true
path of salvation.
The fifth virtue is—
Samdarshi : It means he should treat all alike, be they
rich or poor. The sixth virtue is—
Sarvagi : It means he should have spiritual knowledge.
Only a guru with such a knowledge can remove the doubts in
the field of spiritualism that the devotees may have in their
minds. Then the seventh virtue is that of union with God. Only
such a guru who possesses all these virtues can create
awareness in your concentration (Surti). You should seek
shelter at the holy feet of such a guru alone who has got the
power to enable you to get rid of your cycle of repeated births
and deaths. Remember! no kind of yoga, knowledge, worship
or the pilgrimages to holy places can make one cross the
worldly ocean.


68 Sahib Bandgi
A Satguru, in fact, blesses you with such a powerful
Alive Holy Name which has the power to take you out from
the darkness of ignorance and leads you to the abode of
Supreme Lord.
Koti Naam Sansaar Mein, Tin Tey Mukti Na Hoye.
Mool Naam Jo Gupt Hai, Janey Birla Koye.
There are countless holy names to be found in the world.
But, these can’t help us seek salvation. The real Naam is
the hidden one and only some rare holy saint knows of it.
Kabir Sahib cautions us about it. It can neither be
spoken nor written. Through ‘Naam’ the guru separates your
soul from your mind. After this, the soul stops obeying the
dictates of mind that is left with no alternative but to remain
helpless.
The Satguru prescribes the right type of medicine by
binding the very mind that misleads us and makes us dance
to its tune.

### The Secrets Related To The

### Inner Body Capable Of

### Making Spiritual Visits

Sometimes back, I happened to read a writing in some
newspaper. The question was as to whether our ancestors
actually made trips in the universe? When we think about
such things, we find some unbelievable experiences.
Sometimes, the devotees from different organisations and
sects come and present thier own view points. If one says he
has achieved such and such thing, the other one talks about
that which he has achieved. They express different view points
about that which one achieves first of all.
All the modes of worship are in one way or the other
related to the five postures of meditation. If our ancestors
made trips to the universe, the question arises as to which
kind of a body they used for the purpose. If they used the
physical body, they must have felt the need for some vehicle.
This is because this body doesn’t possess the power to fly
without some vehicle.
Our body is not equipped with any instrument that can
help us to fly. So the question that naturally arises is whether
our ancestors actually made trips in the universe or not.
I had said that I would write about my spiritual
pilgrimages but we know that the mother remains busy as long
as the children are small. The same is the case with me. I have
yet to make my followers strong and so I can’t find any time

```
69
```

70 Sahib Bandgi
for writing about my experiences related to the spiritual
pilgrimages. If I do so at this stage, it will be just like the
case of a woman who came to me and said, “I recite the alive
holy Name, perform Aarti and remember the goddess as well
but find no relief in my headache.” That is to say, she had not
so far followed that only one kind of worship needed to be
performed.
When I shall start writing, I shall have to do so with
full concentration. When you remember Satguru, he comes
before you. He certainly does so. That is to say, there is a
certain kind of body that travels at a very fast speed.
Once, during a meeting, I asked if the evil spirit would
come to any of my disciples. One Rattan Singh raised his
hand and said, “No, it won’t come.” I asked him if he had any
experience regarding the same. He said, “In Ram Garh, some
girl had created a lot of nuisance. She was thrashing everyone.
Someone asked Garu Ram, who was also a disciple, to see
what the matter was. Garu Ram showed some hesitation. He
told this thing to me. I prayed you inwardly to save my honour.
I went to the place and after holding the hand of the girl asked
her what the matter was.” She said, “I am all right. Look there!
she is standing outside the gate. She ran away on seeing you
and is finding it difficult to come inside.” That girl was not
performing any drama. It was really so, that girl was convinced
and on the very next day she got blessed with Naam.
I mean to say, there are certain things that we have not
been able to understand. So it was impossible for our
ancestors to make trips in the universe wihout the assistance
of some kind of body. Everyone of you is in possession of
six bodies that can be used for different purposes. You come
to attend satsang wearing some clothes but you have some


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 71
more clothes at home for wearing it on some special
occasions such as marriage ceremony and etc. Likewise,
there are six bodies within our physical body. Sometimes, you
stand face to face with me. That is not a mere dream state.
There is very much reality in it. During one satsang, I asked
if someone had seen his ownself after coming out of himself.
A girl raised her hand. She was unmarried. One day, her
parents got her betrothed. She came to Ranjadi and said, “I
don’t want to marry. My parents are doing all this against my
wishes. They will agree to it if you talk to them.” Then I called
her parents and told them to send refusal.
She said, “Once I was absorbed in meditation. In the
meantime, my younger sister came and began to play the
tape-recorder. My concentration was on the increase and so
I was feeling inconvenience.”
You can find the tape recorders being played at a loud
voice at 4 a.m. This is an act of sound violence.
In big cities like Mumbai, such persons are taken to
the police station. If, at all, you want to listen to the hymns,
you can do so 15 minutes before sunrise. If your songs disturb
others, it is really not good. You are, so to say, making others
listen to these songs even against their willingness.
So the girl said, “Though the songs were in praise of
you, yet I was feeling disturbed. I thought of getting up to stop
the disturbing sound but the growing pleasure in meditation
prevented me from doing so. In the meantime, I felt that I got
up, stopped the play of tape-recorder and returned back to my
bed. When I came back to my bed (where I was meditating in
a sleeping posture), I found myself sleeping. That body
disappeared on getting up. I thought someone else had stopped
the play of tape-recorder. I asked my sister if she had done


72 Sahib Bandgi
so. She replied in the negative. On getting awake, I found that
only half of the tape had been used. While returning after
stopping the play of tape, I had a chance to have a look at my
own body.”
So what kind of a body it was! It was a body within
her physical body. It was as a result of her burning desire that
her inner power arose and did the needful.
Though you are not in a position to realise, yet it is a
fact that many powers are at work alongwith you. Sometimes,
you happen to meet some danger and you realise that some
power appeared from somewhere and disappeared soon after
taking you out of the embarrassing position.
Human body has been called as a Narayani chola (same
as that of God). This is because, apart from the six bodies,
the power of ‘Sahib’ is also at work within it. The six bodies
are—Sthool, Suksham, Kaaran, Maha Kaaran, Gyan and
Vigyan. The body of the girl that rose up was in the state that
is more awakened than the physical body. It is through these
bodies that the saints and sages reaches upto anyone they like
and even talk to them. Human brain can’t do so.
At Chinnor, one Thakur Sahab was reading a book.
While reading, he felt my presence there. He said to his wife,
“Sahibji had come. Where has he gone?” She replied that she
hadn’t seen him.
Sometimes, even the evil spirits come and meet. Now
let’s see the limit to which each of these six bodies can go.
The physical body can work on this earth alone. If you desire
to have a look at Calcutta while sitting at Jammu, you can do
so. But you won’t be able to do so with this body. Some say,
Jesus Christ had become alive after 3 days. I talked to the
priests about it but none could give any satisfactory answer.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 73
I asked if he had become alive, why he hadn’t remained so
and where he had gone then. None had any answer to this
question. They simply said that a disciple had seen his body.
I said that the disciple had seen the inner body.
When, at Akhnoor, my nephew departed from the
world, he himself came to me and said that he had left his
body. Then I went and actually saw that his body had come
under the debris of a wall that had fallen. Afterwards, his sister
said that one day he came and awoke her from sleep and said
that he had not died and was very much alive. She said that it
was not a dream. Later, he met some other disciples as well.
Then I called him to me and forbade him to meet anyone
again.
Why do the Hindus burn their dead ones. There is some
secret inherent in it. There is nothing wrong in our religion,
be it Shradhs (offering food in the name of the deceased
family members) etc. But all this falls within the limit of
Niranjan. We are not doing any wrong. We have never called
any guru belonging to some other panth as a dacoit or a man
of loose character. We have simply said that their mode of
worship falls within the limit of Niranjan. This is because they
are giving due regard to the ghosts etc. and are engaged in
the performance of other rites and rituals.
The dead body is burnt because the soul keeps
wandering around it. Soul wants to enter into it again. Burning
of the dead body is a sort of signal to the soul that the physical
body it was using as an abode, has perished and that it should
not show any more attachment to the bodily cage.
Then why is there the recitation of Garud Puran (holy
scripture)? It is done for 10-11 days. For this much period


74 Sahib Bandgi
the soul remains there. Though it can see all, yet none can
see it. I have seen thousands of such souls. You can also see
them. By concentrating at the dead ones you can see them.
But, what is the need of doing so? There is a great power in
concentration. That is why all talk of it. Kabir Sahib says—
Surti Se Dekh Sakhi Veh Desh.
O loved one! you can see that world through
concentration.
In this Garud Puran one finds the details about the
soul. Kabir Sahib had imparted spiritual knowledge to Garud.
Kabir Sahib says to Dharam Dass—
Pratham Garud Se Bhent Jab Bhayu.
Satya Naam Kaah Bole Suneyu.
Dharam Dass Suno Kahyo Bujhayi.
Jehi Vidhi Se Tahi Samjhayi.
O Dharam Dass! I gave the message of Satya Naam (Alive
Holy Name) to Garud in the very first meeting I had with
him.
Then, it asked as to who I was and wherefrom I had
come. I replied that I had come from Amarlok to make souls
free from the grip of Kaal and to take them back to Amarlok
as per the dictates of Param Purush (Supreme Lord).
Garudji was astonished to know of it and said—
Sunat Garud Achambho Mane.
Satya Purush Ahi Ko Aana.
Pratyakh Dev Krishan Kahavein.
Dush Avtar So Dhari Dhari.
He said, “Who is Satya Purush! It is Krishan who is
called as an omnipresent god and also it is he alone who
incarnates.
At this, Kabir Sahib said, “You don’t know Satya


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 75
Purush. He has nothing to do with incarnations. It is only His
manifestation that we find everywhere. Neither He incarnates
Himself nor He has a body made of 5 material objects.
Moreover, He never takes birth in the womb of any mother
like other incarnations. Everyone who takes birth in the womb
of a mother has his body made of material objects and is, as
such, perishable. But, that Sahib (Satya Purush) never gets
perished.”
In fact, He is far beyond the 3 lok’s and is the only
rare one.
Garudji couldn’t believe all this and said, “I am the
vehicle of Krishanji. You don’t seem to know him. He is the
Supreme Lord of the 3 lok’s and there is none except him.”
Kabir Sahib said, “That Sahib (Param Purush) and he
is the only one and is altogether different from the mayaic
illusion of God. He never moves about and is neither born
nor gets perished.”
There was thus a great dialogue about the Amarlok and
the soul. That very knowledge is contained in Garud Puran.
That is why it has a great significance.
Whenever a person departs from the world, his dead
body is laid on the ground. Then a sheet of cloth is put on
his body. Then the relatives come to have a look at it. After
this, the neighbours and friends begin to assemble there. A
pitcher and other related material are collected and the dead
body is given a bath with the water mixed with some water
of the river Ganges. This is done to prevent any evil spirit
from approaching near.
After that the dead body is taken to the grave yard and
with the recitation of Gayatri Mantra the final rites are
performed. The pitcher is also broken and the water from the


76 Sahib Bandgi
Ganges is sprinkled so as to prevent the evil spirits from
taking the soul alongwith them as a friend.
Finally, the bones etc. are submerged in the river
Ganges so that the evil spirits may remain far away. Now, what
have we been doing? We have been telling the devotees to
recite the ‘Naam’ blessed by the Satguru in order to keep the
evil spirits at bay.
In our organisation, just the casting of a glance alone
serves the purpose of keeping the evil spirits away. It is the
persons associated with the rites and rituals who mislead the
people otherwise there remains nothing to be done after the
departure of Hansa (Soul).
So the soul wanders. When we leave our home, we
think of returning back after doing some particular job. If due
to some mishappening, our body collapses on the way, our
attachment for our home will still remain. That is why the
devotees are advised to have their concentration at all the
times at their Satguru.
As the soul doesn’t believe it has lost its body, the
recitation of Garud Puran for 11 days helps it know that he
is not the body. None recites Devi Bhagwat Puran or Sakand
Puran because these don’t contain the spiritual knowledge that
Kabir Sahib gave to Garud. In Kabir Sagar one finds a mention
of it.
Once Garudji said to Lord Vishnu, “I move about
carrying you. I request you to shower your grace by imparting
me the spiritual knowledge.” At this, Lord Vishnu said that
there is only one such person who can impart this spiritual
knowledge and that person is Muninder (at that time Kabir
Sahib had descended on the earth as Muninder).
Among the hypocrites, those who know all this, don’t


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 77
want to let others know of it because that will spoil the very
source of their income. That is why they prevent people from
following the Sahib Bandgi spiritual organisation.
They try to imitate us in every possible manner. They
recite the couplets of Kabir Sahib but interpret these in a
manner which serves their self interests.
While sleeping at night, you should fix your
concentration at your Satguru. It will help you have the vision
of your Satguru during night as well. If you are feeling thirsty
and you go to sleep without satisfying your thirst, you will
remain in search of water in your dreams as well. If you feel
need to pass urine and go to sleep without doing so, you will
remain searching for the toilet during the whole night.
Likewise, sleeping with concentration at the Satguru will
certainly take you to him.
A certain fellow asked his daughter to fetch him a glass
of water. She went to fetch water. The T.V was on and the
fellow happened to touch a live wire. As a result, he breathed
his last. The daughter says that whenever her father meets her,
he asks for water. This is because his concentration at that
time was fixed at it.
Other rites and rituals including the serving of food
to the Brahmans etc. are also performed. But I say there is
no need for all this. Food to the Brahmans is served so that
the soul may reach Brahm lok. In U.P a very good tradition
is followed. The people over there don’t drink water even from
the hands of Brahmans who take meat and other intoxicants.
I ask the devotees to arrange for a Bhandara (food
served at the end of a religious function) in the Ashram while
the hypocrites ask to do so at home. I don’t partake of the
Bhandara arranged by my devotees. But these will be the


78 Sahib Bandgi
enlightened souls who will partake of it. So there is no selfish
motive in my asking them to do so.
You are in possession of great powers. But it is the
mind that dominates the soul and makes it believe otherwise.
The relatives who press you to act as per their guidelines are
not to be blamed because they have been educated to behave
in that very particular manner. It took me 18 years to make
my mother understand the true mode of worship. She used
to worship Thakurji (incarnation of Lord Vishnu). After
cooking food, she used to sit for about half an hour in her
worship. I felt irritated as I had to wait for food at least for
half an hour. We could receive food only after she had offered
the same to Thakurji.
I keep myself under control otherwise the people, with
their offerings of articles like a flute, a silver crown etc.
would have made me, so to say, like the grand maternal uncle
of Kahna (childhood name of Lord Krishan). I return all their
offerings and remain within my limit.
My younger brother, on the occasion of his marriage
ceremony, asked me to wear coat and pant. I refused to do
so. He said that I had worn it when I had been in army. I said
that I had to do so under compulsion. He said that he won’t
wear Sehra (bridegroom’s crown) in case I didn’t wear coat
and pant. I said that it would be a right thing as I didn’t want
him to get entangled in the mayaic net. Then he asked me to
dance at the time of marriage. I said that I would never do
that. At this, he said that he won’t marry then. I said that it
would be a very good thing as I didn’t want him to get
entangled in these worldly affairs.
Once, a lady from Bihar stood up during satsang and
requested me in her own language to stop the deliverance of


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 79
sermons and to sing some hymns, instead. She said that my
singing of devotional songs using a pitcher sounded very
charming. You should know that I can dance in a very pleasing
and charming way. One girl was dancing. I said that her dance
was not much appreciable and that I would show her how to
dance. When I danced, she burst into laughter to such an extent
that she began to feel pain in her stomach. She said that it
was not at all a dance because neither my arms nor my legs
showed any movement. I asked her if she had ever seen such
a dance which has made her laugh so much. My dance is of a
rare kind. Sometimes, some fat gurus also begin to dance but
it is not possible for them to do so. Then many others also
expressed their desire to see that dance. I said that I am not
a dancer. In this context, Kabir Sahib has said—
Naachna Koodna Taalka Peetna,
Randiya Khel Hai Bhakti Naahin.
The act of dancing and drum beating can in no way be
called as worship. It is, rather, a play of widows.
If I colour my hair, your attention will get diverted
there and if I wear a shirt with some print, your attention will
again and again get diverted to it. But I want that your attention
should remain towards the spiritual knowledge that I impart.
We have not to let our attention get diverted towards the
worldly things.
Now let’s turn to the six bodies working within us. We
can perform all the jobs of the world with our Sthool Shareer
(gross body) but it hasn’t the power to fly.
We attain the ethereal body in our dream and do a lot
of noble as well as evil deeds. We have spent a good part of
our life in seeing dreams but we have no knowledge of the
way we attain this body.
The third body is called as causal body. Everyone of


80 Sahib Bandgi
us is making a use of it. The inner world is a very strange one.
This body has great concentration in it. Sometimes,
we see some fellow lost in himself. We shake him and ask
as to where he has been lost. The fellow had reached to that
place where he was concentrating at. It was nothing but the
causal body.
Sometimes, you feel as if the thought of some
particular person is moving about in your mind. It means that
that very particular person is concentrating at you. You say
your attention is getting diverted to him. Then, all of a
sudden, you find that very fellow infront of you. You feel
surprised at what has happened. But in the meantime, the mind
makes you forget all about it.
One day, Bhanumati (a Nami) said, “Sahibji, Ranjadi
looks deserted when you go out. Then we find somewhat
difficult to spend our time. But, when the time of your arrival
approaches, we regain consciousness.” I said, “When I go out,
my whole attention gets diverted to that very place but before
my coming back, my full attention gets diverted to this place.”
So our causal body can reach even the farthest corner
of the world. The fourth one is called as the super-causal body.
The afore said girl who said that she came back to the body
after stopping the play of Deck, was, in fact, saying about this
super causal body. Only the devotees can attain it. With its
help they can do anything they like. But it is not so easy to
attain it. Though the ghee is present in milk, yet one can’t
collect it without churning.
It is only the Maha Yogeshvars who are in a position
to attain the fifth body. It is called as Gyan Dehi. After
attaining this, they become Brahmnishath (absorbed in
Brahm). The sixth body called as the Vigyan Dehi can see
without eyes and can walk without feet. With its help we can
perform work as well.
Our ancestors used this body for performing


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 81
pilgrimages. We hear the stories about Naradji’s visits to
Vishnu lok, Shiv lok and other lok’s. Many others including
Vashishathji made similar visits. It is not a joke but a reality.
All this is the game of concentration which has many secrets
inherent in it. Keep this concentration fixed at your Satguru.
There was a boy. He used to tease his mother daily.
He expressed his desire for various eatables like curd, butter
and the like. The mother prepared what he asked for. One day,
the father told him that instead of teasing his mother like that
he should take milk that contains all these things. Likewise,
for a devotee who concentrates at his Satguru, there remains
nothing to be done. The Vedas also endorse this view.
Dhyan Moolam Guru Roopam,
Pooja Moolam Guru Paadkam.
Mantar Moolam Guru Vakyam,
Moksh Moolam Guru Kripa.
Concentrate at the appearance of guru and worship his
holy feet. Take his words as incantation and his blessings
as the gateway to salvation.
But, the people enter into discussion without
sufficient cause. There was a Teli (a community who deals
in oil). He used to tease a Jaat (a community) saying, “Jaat
re Jaat, tere sar par khaat” The latter got offended and
irritated. He retaliated saying, “Teli re Teli, tere sar par kohlu.”
The Teli said, “What I say is a proverb and carries weight
whereas that which you have said, doesn’t carry weight.” The
Jaat argued that even though his remarks didn’t carry weight,
yet he (teli) will get pressed under the weight of Kohlu.
Such like talk really lacks arguments. We don’t believe
in all this.

### The Waves Of Mind

Kasturi Kundal Basey, Mrigh Khoje Bann Mahin.
Aise Ghat Ghat Saiyan, Moorakh Janat Nahin.
The musk is present within the naval of the deer but it
makes a search of it in the forests. Likewise, God (Param
Purush) is present within every human being though like
fools we seem to be ignorant of it.
It clearly shows that there are some invisible forces
within us that prevent us from realising Him.
Chashm Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashe Ho Rahey.
Dil Sataan Kya Kya Hain Tere, Dil Satane Ke Liye.
Try to watch with your inner eyes (eyes of concentration)
the various kinds of games that are being enacted within
you solely for the purpose of torturing you in all possible
ways.
Ego is the greatest hurdle in the path of soul
realisation. The thought of our being Mr./Ms. so and so
prevents us from reaching out to our soul.
The only hurdle between us and Supreme Lord is that
of our ego and it is this hurdle that has been preventing us
from attaining the true realisation of Supreme Lord. This ego
of ours is responsible for making our relationships with
others good or bad. This is the game of mind. Kabir Sahib
says—
Tera Baeri Koi Nahin, Tera Baeri Mann.
None else but, your mind is your enemy.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 83
We have to see whether it is the mind alone that
creates problems for us or there is some role of our soul as
well in it. Undoubtedly, the soul also associates with the mind
in all the activities but it is the mind that plays the major role.
Our soul has taken itself as body and does all that the mind
desires. The mind has its agents like sex, anger, greed,
attachment and ego. The anger makes us do many wrong acts
while greed makes us indulge in acts of cheating, forgery and
etc. The ego badly affects our cordial relations with others
while attachment drowns us within the narrow limits of our
near and dear ones. Whole of the world seems to be entangled
in this mayaic net.
Out of ignorance, our soul has been entangled in the
grip of mind that makes it act as per its (mind’s) dictates
through its agents.
But, without the energy supplied by our soul, our mind
would become helpless and would fail to perform any activity
as per its desire. It can happen only when the soul begins to
realise its realself. So to say, the soul is being tortured in a
variety of ways at the hands of the evil forces that are
opposing it.
Our opponents also try to create hurdles in our path
like these opposing forces. At Mishriwala, I used to hold
satsangs at noon. One fellow raised a temple nearby and
everytime during the satsang, a loud speaker was played to
create disturbance. One day, some Panditji went there and
scolded the fellow for creating disturbance in the satsang that
was held only once a month. He asked him to stop that silly
activity. That Panditji was not a devotee. That is to say, the
world is not devoid of noble persons who are ever ready to
oppose wrong acts boldly.


84 Sahib Bandgi
The same thing happened in Chinor as well. The
hypocrites do all such activities only to prevent people from
gaining the spiritual knowledge being imparted by the Sahib
Bandgi organisation. They know that after attaining this true
knowledge the people would try to free themselves from their
grip and would feel inclined to become the followers of our
panth. Their business of exploiting the innocent masses would
then suffer a severe blow. This act of cheating is being
performed not only by the ordinary hypocrites but even by
those belonging to great religious organisations.
Likewise, the soul, after knowing its real identity, will
be able to understand all the wrongful acts of cheating,
forgery etc. being committed by mind and will try to free
itself from the grip of the latter.
Whenever we try to know our real identity, the mind
diverts our attention towards the worldly affairs. It tries its
best to make us drown in its magical waves.
You must know that your opponent makes you strong.
It is a well established fact. So I have no ill-will towards my
opponents. Our organisation has flourished at a very fast
speed and that too within a short period. The credit for it goes
to our opponents. When the hypocrites burnt our Ashrams,
the followers felt much perturbed but I remained calm. Now
we have started raising concrete structures and the followers
are making all possible contribution for it. The credit for this
as well goes to our opponents who made my followers stand
like a mountain.
Moreover, these hypocrites have become the selfless
preachers of our organisation. In this context, Kabir Sahib has
said—


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 85
Nindak Mera Mat Maro, Jiyo Adi Jugadi.
Kabir Satguru Paya, Nindak Ke Parsadi.
My denouncer shouldn’t die. He should live long. Kabir
Sahib says that he realised his Satguru through his
denouncer.
A denouncer makes us alert. Our mind is like a
mountain of sand that stands before the soul like a big hurdle.
Our feelings of pleasure and pain are due to our mind alone.
When our desires don’t get satisfied, we feel pains. But when
the desires get satisfied, we feel pleasures. Now the question
arises as to wherefrom do the desires surface.
It is our mind that is the source of all our desires.
Whenever we begin to think of ourselves, it diverts our
attention to some other material object or thing. So to say, it
doesn’t leave us alone for a moment even.
If we give a serious thought to all that is happening,
we shall find that it is the mind that is behind all the major
mishappenings like wars, conflicts, etc. That is why Kabir
Sahib says—
Teen Lok Mein Mann He Viraji,
Tahen Na Cheenat Pandit Qazi.
It is the mind that is present in all the 3 lok’s but the
religious priests are at a loss to understand all this.
So to say, the existence of whole of the world is due
to mind itself. Sometimes, it incites us to slap some fellow
but we can save ourselves from the awkward position if we
don’t obey its dictates. Someone asked P.T.Usha as to how
had she developed such a strong stamina. She said that she
used to practise on sand on the bank of the sea. It is nothing
but foolishness to seek pleasures. Nanak Devji says—
Nanak Dukhiya Sab Sansaar.


86 Sahib Bandgi
Whole of the world is under the shadow of sorrows and
sufferings.
This is because everyone of us continues to suffer
from an unending chain of one or the other kind of sorrows.
Anyhow, we can make our lives a bit pleasant if we increase
our power to fight with the sorrows and sufferings.
This mind is a great devil. It has always created and
has still been creating all sorts of hurdles in the path of true
worshippers.
Watch silently, without desiring to have any vision of
your choice, the activities being performed by mind. Soon
you will be able to realise how it cheats and misleads you.
This activity will help you to remain vigilant at all the times.

```
Mann He Niranjan, Mann He Onkaar, Mann He Hai Kartara.
Jeev Ke Sang Mann Kaal Rahai, Agyani Narr Jaanat Nahin.
Mind himself is Niranjan, Mind himself is Onkaar,
Mind himself is the Ruling Power of the Universe
(3 Lok’s).The Death of every being resides with him
as in form of Mind for whole life but, the ignorant
human being is not at all aware of this truth.

### Once It Occurred To A Hansa

The animals speak a natural language while man has
developed an unnatural one. The natural language of man is
that which a dumb fellow makes use of. The use of words like
Papa, Mama is taught to the child who picks these up. In fact,
the language is a sort of sound which has the feelings inherent
in it and to know these feelings is considered as the
knowledge of language. But sometimes, the children display
their feelings of pleasure or pain etc. even without the use
of any language. No use of words has to be made in the
language of the soul. It is this, that is called as the soundless
sound. This special sort of language is used in ‘Amarlok’.
Ek Hans Ke Hridaey Jo Aayi, Doosar Hans Samajh Pun Jayi.
A Hans can easily understand what the other Hans has
to say.
This is the language of concentration. The mind sends
its waves upto this concentration and entangles it in its mayaic
mesh. The sounds emanating from within are also nothing but
a game of mind because there can be no sound without the
presence of the two. The musical sounds emanate only after
coming in contact with the tissues of the body.
In our body, the soul has been present in the form of
seven concentrations. The pleasure we feel in the worldly
objects is actually due to our concentration alone. It is not
present in the objects themselves but is present in our


88 Sahib Bandgi
concentration itself. This concentration has the same element
as is to be found in Supreme Lord.
Aatam Mein Parmatam Darshey.
The soul presents a glimpse of Supreme Lord.
Supreme Lord is present in the soul in a manner the
sensation of cold is present in water and that of heat is
present in fire. That is why this soul of ours is a store-house
of pleasures. But, the mind deprives us from these pleasures
by making our concentration wander about in the worldly
objects.

```
Naam Videhi Jab Miley, Andar Khulein Kapaat.
Daya Sant Satguru Bina, Ko Batlavey Baat.
—Tulsi Sahib (Hathras waley)
Tulsi Dass ji says, “The inner gate of conscience gets
opened only after getting blessed with the bodiless
‘Naam’. None but the grace of Sant Satguru can show
the needed path in this regard.”

### He, Whose Shelter We Seek,

### Comes To Our Rescue

Jo Mere Sharnagati Aayi,
Tisko Rakhun Main Pran Ki Nayi.
Kabir Sahib says that he protects a devotee like Pranas
(vital force in the body) who seeks his shelter.
You won’t find any mention of the importance of yoga,
religious rituals, noble deeds etc. in my spiritual discourses.
In Sant Mat, it is only the seeking of true shelter that has a
definite significance. It is altogether different from that of
Sargun or Nirgun modes of worship.
There is a need to have a clear understanding about the
very concept of worship.
Let’s first turn to the Sargun worship. We are not the
denouncers of any mode of worship. We are just talking about
the true spiritualism. Many vices have crept up in the sphere
of worship. So to say, the religion seems to have been
commercialised. Violence, corruption etc. seem to have crept
up in all the prevalent organisations, sects and religions.
Some are cheating and robbing the innocent masses
in the name of Hatya (ill-effect caused by the soul of some
deceased family member), some are doing so in the name of
planets while others are doing so in the name of the gods and
the goddesses and the like. If we have a look at those who
are occupying all the religious places, we shall find that they
are there simply for the sake of their families. An impartial
study of facts will confirm this hard reality. Kabir Sahib has said—
Paet Ke Kaaran Karey Guruvayi.
Piddi Sahit Narak Mein Jayi.


90 Sahib Bandgi
He who assumes the role of a Guru for the sake of
satisfying his hunger alone, will go to hell alongwith his
descendants.
All the religious places, like temples, mosques or
churches have been raised with the donations collected from
the public. Those who occupy these places of worship, get
two or three rooms constructed for their families and begin
to live like owners. After the death of every occupant, his son
comes forward to carry on the usual religious activities.
Nowhere the selfless religious preachers are to be seen.
Bulle Shah has rightly remarked—
Thakur Dwarey Thag Hai Basdey, Vich Teerthan Dhavdi.
Vich Masitan Posti Basdey, Aashaq Rahan Alag.
Thags (cheats) have occupied the Thakur dwaras (Hindu
temples); the thieves are to be seen in places of
pilgrimage; idle men have been occupying the mosques
while the loved ones of God keep aloof.
He has said so on the basis of his experience.
A lady came to me with horoscopes of her three sons.
She gave to me Rs. 300 as fees. She said that her sons didn’t
take interest in studies. I asked her if she had got blessed with
‘Naam’. She replied that she had done so. I said, “You still
seem to be entangled in superstitions. It appears as if
someone has attributed the problem of the children to the ill-
effects of the planets.”
Another lady came alongwith her post-graduate
daughter. She said that due to the ill-effect of the planet Saturn
her daughter was not in a position to memorise things. How
strange it appears! What has the planet saturn to do with the
memory of a girl. Some cheat had asked her to pay Rs. 1600/-
as fee for protecting the girl from the ill-effect of the planet
Saturn.
So I returned Rs. 300/- to the first lady and said, “I


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 91
don’t charge any fee. I know astrology but I don’t want to make
use of it. This is because no planet can have its ill-effect on
one who has been blessed with ‘Naam’ and so there is no need
to study the horoscopes.”
Still I have a look at the horoscope if I find someone
in great trouble.
What are these planets? What is a horoscope? How
to study it? The first thing to be seen is the birth place of the
child. Then the time of its birth is noted. Then the position
of various planets at that time is taken into account. Suppose
at the time of birth, Mars was very much near to the earth. In
that case Mars will be taken as the lord of its horoscope. After
this, the Rashi (Sign of Zodaic) is also taken into
consideration. There are twelve Rashis. Thus, the knowledge
of all these things can help us make a prediction about the
future of a person.
Sometimes, people ask me as to what kind of
profession they should adopt. Suppose a person has ‘Simha’
as his Rashi and has the planet Saturn as his lord, he would
undertake jobs full of danger. He who has ‘Kanya’ as his
Rashi, won’t like to undertake the jobs involving any risk. This
involves a scientific study.
At least, one should be M.A. in mathematics to
understand it fully. But the people have taken it as a profession
and have opened shops with insufficient knowledge about the
science of astrology.
Anyway, a disciple needn’t bother about all this as the
planets can do no harm to him. There seems to be no need to
get entangled in all this after seeking the shelter of a Satguru.
Jeevan Ka Saunp Diya,
Sab Bhaar Tumhare Haathon Mein.
Hai jeet Tumhare Haathon Mein,
Hai Haar Tumhare Haathon Mein.


92 Sahib Bandgi
After complete surrender before the Satguru, it becomes
the duty of the latter to care for the victory or defeat of
his disciple.
A disciple should have such a kind of devotion for his
Guru. I asked that lady to give doses of Chavanprash to the
children and make suitable arrangement for their tution as they
were dull in studies. The planet Saturn had nothing to do with
it. It is clear that before getting blessed with Naam, the lady
used to act as per the guidelines of the hypocrites. I am
providing you the purest things. Among my disciples, there
are directors, lecturers etc. I told my disciples to avoid
collecting money by misleading others. Earlier, doctors used
to treat the patients as suffering fellows but now they take
them as customers.
Many persons, with the active support of the
politicians, have set up their private coaching centres and
colleges. They are charging huge sums of money from the
students.
All this is nothing but a sort of business. The
government. can’t provide job to all the educated persons and
the banks have been asked to provide them loans for starting
some private business. Some have set up Nursing Homes
though they find it difficult to pay even the salaries to the
doctors.
One Naami lady had set up a hospital. She said that it
was difficult to make a suitable earning by following my
teachings. This is because to rob the patients in every possible
manner has become the nature of a majority of doctors. Even
in case of simple diseases which can be cured by medicines,
the patients are misled and advised to undergo operations.
Also, such tests as have nothing to do with the disease are
suggested to the patients. Just as a lawyer doesn’t want the
litigation to come to an end so easily, the doctors also don’t


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 93
want to let the patient escape from their clutches so easily.
Such an approach will certainly prove harmful for the soul.
To follow the truth, we shall have to bear some amount of
trouble.
One disciple donated me land worth 40 lac rupees. The
Patwari demanded Rs. 5000 for issuing a copy of the detail
related to the piece of land but I didn’t agree to it. Two years
has passed. The land is there though we haven’t been able to
get the legal possession of it yet.
Likewise, the modern sages don’t allow the devotees
to escape from their clutches so easily.
Duson Disha Mein Lagi Aag.
Kahey Kabir Kahan Jaiyo Bhaag.
Kabir Sahib says that all the ten directions have been
engulfed by fire and there appears to be no way to escape.
Almost all the priests (Hindu and Christian), Geyanis
(Sikh priests), Maulvis (Muslim priests), Mahants (sages in
big Hindu Ashrams) etc. use some part of the money
collected from donations or offerings for their own purposes
as well.
A majority of people who serve as priests in religious
places, do so for the sake of money, rather than, for the
purpose of making people spiritually enlightened. We have
to think whether such persons can prove our real guide so far
as the question of attaining salvation is concerned.
Not only this much, many such priests indulge in acts
of cheating as well. Sometime back, a great yajya was
performed. The people were rushed to every possible place
for collecting money. Many of these people had been issued
receipt books. It was declared as the first great yajya after
Dwapar. Public was even forced to donate for the purpose.
The organisers had a golden chance to keep big chunks of
money for themselves. Many Havan Kunds (a square vessel


94 Sahib Bandgi
of clay or metal in which oblations to fire are made) were
erected for the purpose. The fee for being a Yajman (one who
performs a sacrifice/host) varied from Rs. 1100/- to Rs.
1500/-. The sages slipped away after collecting crores of
rupees. On seeing all this game, the shastris who normally
held religious discourses (Satva), stopped this normal
practice that yielded less money and instead, started
performing yajyas. When, afterwards, the yajyas lost their
charm, the shastris began to perform both—yajyas as well as
satvahs so as to let no one escape from their fold.
Now I want to ask as to how many people have changed
themselves in their behaviour and moral thinking. There is a
joke related to this moral thinking. An old lady boarded on a
bus. The bus was loaded to its capacity and there was no seat
lying unoccupied. She kept standing. Another lady was also
standing in the bus. She said, “There is no morality to be found
these days.” She began to deliver a lecture on it. In the
meantime, a young man vacated his seat and the said lady
herself sat there without bothering for the old lady. This is
our morality. She was delivering a lecture on morality. In this
context, Kabir Sahib has said—
Kahanta Narr Bahaute Miley, Gahanta Miley Na Koye.
Vah Kahanta Beh Janey De, Jo Nahin Gahanta Hoye.
There are many who preach but there is none to be found
who practises. You should leave aside those who preach
but don’t practise.
The same is the case in the field of worship. Those
who themselves are misled, are acting as guides to others.
Bandhey Ko Bandha Miley, Gaanth Chhudave Kaun.
Andhey Ko Andha Miley, Raah Dikhave Kaun.
He who himself is in bondage, can’t be expected to free
some other one like him. Likewise, a blind man can’t be
expected to show the path to some other one like him.


Without Soul Realisation, Man Has To Wander 95
A casual look will show that the outward worship being
performed by the people is related to the satisfaction of the
bodily needs only.
I want to impress upon you that I don’t need any money
for the satisfaction of my bodily needs. I did this job about 40
years back. My joining the army was a job of satisfying my
bodily related needs. Now I receive about Rs. 15000/- as
pension. I satisfy my bodily needs out of this pension. I don’t
take any extra thing for food. Also, inactiveness has no place
in my life. While travelling by plane, I don’t take any eatable
out of the diet worth Rs. 500/- that every passenger has a right
to avail of. One girl asked me, why I was not taking any eatable.
I said, “You people serve veg as well as non-veg with your hands
and also carry the left-over food in the same manner. I carry
even my drinking water with me.”
I say all that is pure and real. I speak about the need
of reforms in society. I want that not even a pie of the money
donated by my followers should be used for any wrong
purpose. I first practise then preach to my followers.
At the time of elections, all the sages speak in favour
of one or the other political party but I never work as an
ambassador of anyone.
Kabira Khadda Bazar Mein, Sab Ki Maange Khaer.
Na Kahu Se Dosti, Na Kahu Se Baer.
Kabir Sahib says that he has been standing in the bazar.
Neither he has any friendship nor enmity towards anyone.
We are talking about the seeking of shelter at the holy
feet of some true Guru. We also say that one can’t achieve
anything on the basis of one’s deeds alone. It is only the grace
of a Satguru that can help one attain salvation. The thing I have
given to you will give you protection as well.
Adhbhut Naam Sada Rakhwala.
That rare bodiless ‘Naam’ will always give you
protection.


96 Sahib Bandgi
Nav Grah Ka Bus Nahin Chalayi,
Sabai Vighan Sada Tal Jayi.
The nine planets won’t be able to do any harm to you and
all your misfortunes will always pass off.
Under no circumstances can we cross the worldly
ocean without getting blessed with ‘Naam’. This rare ‘Naam’
creates awareness and awakening in us and enables us to
realise our inner enemies. None in this universe can keep the
soul in his grip. It can never be imprisoned. It is not possible
to take anything out of it or to add anything to it. It is, indeed,
a very rare thing but, strange to say, it is doing harm to itself
by its own power and energy.
It is acting as per the dictates of mind that, otherwise,
has no energy of its own. If the mind makes a desire to move
about, soul comes forward to satisfy its desire. The mind can
do nothing if the soul refuses to obey it. The soul has its own
source of energy and the mind makes use of this energy for
its own purposes. So it is clear that the soul is misleading
itself by its own energy.
The sole function of ‘Naam’ is to create awareness and
awakening in a being regarding its trueself.
