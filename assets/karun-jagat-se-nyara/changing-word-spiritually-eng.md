# Changing The World Spiritually

```
(Karun Jagat Se Nyaar)
```
```
Par Lagan Ko Har Kooi Chahe,
Bin Satguru Koi Par Na Pave.
The glory of Satguru is such that he brings change.
World is following a false Religion-Dharma. Satguru frees
you from treachery, fraud, etc. and transforms you from
the coveted Minded into a nectarine individual. Earlier it
was a reign of Mind. Even after many lives, such a
transformation is hard to achieve.
Yeh Sab Sahib Tumhi Keena, Barna Main Tha Param Malina.
After being Blessed with Satya Naam from Satguru you
get the powers of Naam which fights with vices; Lust,
Anger, Greed, Hate, and Pride etc. Purity restored.

## My Goal

Holy sants used the common man’s language in a very
simpler form to convey their teachings to the people, about
the true presence and appearance of ‘Supreme Lord’ which
can easily be realized from their sayings. Kabir Sahib and
other Holy Sants used the words ‘ **Ram’ , ‘Hari’ , ‘Har’ ,
‘Sai’, 'Govind'** etc in their sayings to make people
understand in people’s language, but the meaning to all the
above said words for them remains the same which were
used for ‘Supreme Lord’ (Param Purush Sahib) only. So
there is no need to get puzzled while reading or hearing
such words in their teachings. Kabir Sahib has clarified this
fact by talking about four different ‘Rams’.
Saakar Ram Dashrath Ka Beta, Nirakar Ghat Ghat Mein Leta.
Bindu Ram Jin Jagat Pasaara, Niralamb Ram Sahib Te Nyara.
The people in the world are saying that Sants are the
devotees of the same Ram who they are worshipping.
However Kabir Sahib has said that latter is Ram having
mortal body i.e. Sakar Ram. In other places Sants are
mistakenly considered the devotees of formless Ram i.e.
Nirakar, the second Ram. The third Ram is the Sperm
which has created the world around us. But the Sants
worship the fourth one who is free. He is not incarnated
through the process of birth and death. He is the one who
has been addressed as **‘** Sahib **’** by the Sants. Some of the
verses of Sants also have references to the formless
worship because before getting the Diksha of holy Naam
from Kabir Sahib, they were the devotees of Formless Ram
(Niranjan) which itself is the fifth element of this world
Akash-Dark matter. Again in some places Sants have
talked about the secrets of Yoga etc. in their discourses.
They have also talked about the internal sounds and
about the 10th aperture of human body. Due to this, people
feel that the Sants have talked about the importance of
yoga, which is not true. Sants have said this in order to tell


6 Sahib Bandgi
the limits of yoga. Stating all this they have emphasized the
importance of the “Essence Word” i.e. Saar-shabd which
does not emanate from internal sounds. Hence it is also
known as “Soundless sound” or Nih-shabd heard in Dhyan
on Satguru on the 8th chakra. Thus one must not get
confused on finding the description of internal sounds or
internal game in their words. The only thing to be
understood here is that the Sants have described these three
worlds (lokas) as the perishable world of Kal Purush
(Niranjan). And they have also talked about the
indestructible world i.e. Amar-loka (the Supreme Lord’s
abode), which can be reached through our concentration
(Surati). Hence you don’t have to wander outside in search
of the Supreme Lord. The way to Him is opened only when
you get the holy Name (Saar- shabd) possessed by the
Sants alone.
The word ‘TRUTH’ refers to “The Reality Unknown to
Humanity.” All Truth goes through three phases. First, it is
ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is
accepted as being self-evident.
I want to pass the pure knowledge of Soul (Atma-
Gyaan) to you. Today nobody talks about Atma-Gyan. All
are lost. Some are wandering outside the body and some
inside it. None has any idea of Atma-gyan.
Is Duniya Ki Reet Anoothi, Tajay Saach Aur Zhooth Se Preeti.
This world has altogether a very strange way of living
where people discard the ‘Truth’ and has immense love
and faith for ‘Falsehood’.
***
Ved chaaron naahin janat, Satya Purush kahaniyan.
All the four Vedas does not know anything about the
reality related to Param Purush

1. IS A GURU ESSENTIAL?

Gurubrahma Guruvishnu Gurudevo Maheshwar|
Guru Sakshat Parabrahma Tasmay Shree Guru Vey Namah||
The result of union of Father and Mother is Progeny. It
is strange, however it is true. Union with Guru results in
essence of power of Parameshwar. Without a Guru, it's not
possible to manifest the power of Ishwar in you.
Guru Ki Sharan Lijey Bhai| Jasey Jiv Narak Nahi Jai||
Gurumukh Hoi Parampadh Pavey|Chaurasi Mey Bahuri Na Avey||
Guru has greatness. The Rigved says that a moment of
meditation on his Guru is greater than remaining in Kashi
for thousands of years. In the Treta Yuga, Rishi Valmiki
has established the importance and greatness of Guru in
Ramayana. Those Rishis of Dwapar Yuga also talked about
the importance and the greatness devotion to Guru. In Gita,
Vasudev Krishna directed Arjuna to give up all other forms
of devotion and to remain absorbed in him only because
Krishna was the Guru for Arjuna at that time. In the most
revered script of Kaliyug, Ramcharit Manas, Goswami
Tulsidasji has given a higher position to Guru.
Bandau Guru Padh Kanj Kripa Sindhu Nar Roop Hari|
Mahamoha Tap Punj Jaasu Vachan Ravi Kar Nikar||
Meaning, I offer my salutation at the feet of my Guru,
Ocean of Grace who in the Human form is verily Hari
himself and his words destroys the Inner darkness like
Sunrays.
However, the Sants have brought a revolution in the
field of Spirituality. Sahib has spoken neither just to please
anybody nor was he biased.
Guru Govind Dou Khade,Kake Lagun Paye.
Balihari Guru Aapno,Jin Govind Diyo Bataye.
Guru was equaled to God before the arrival of Sants.
Our Holy Scriptures and sages have given even equal
status to Guru and God. However, Sants brought a
revolution in the spiritual field. They placed Satguru even
above God. Guru Charandas's disciple Sehjobai has


8 Sahib Bandgi
expressed in her beautiful words, the higher position of a
Guru compared to God-
Hari Tajun Guru Ko Na Bisarun|
Guru Ke Sam Hari Ko Na Niharun||
Hari Nejanam Diyo Jag Mahin|
Guru Ne Avagaman Chhudai||
Hari Ne Panch Chor Diyo Satha|
Guru Ne Laichhudai Anatha||
Hari Ne Kutumb Jaal Mein Gheeri|
Guru Ne Kati Mamta Bairi||
Hari Ne Rog Bhog Urjhayo|
Guru Yogi Kar Sabai Chhudayo||
Harihari Ne Karm Bharm Bharmayo|
Guru Ne Aatm Roop Lakhayo||
Hari Ne Monse Aap Chhipayo|
Guru Deepak De Tahi Dikhayo||
Charandas Par Tan Man Varun|
Guru Na Tajun Hari Ko Taj Daru||
Sahjo Bai says, “I can leave God but I can’t leave my
Guru. I don’t want to see God even in the presence of my
Guru. God threw me in the worldly ocean of life and death
but it is my Guru who saved me from it. God had sent
along with me five thieves like lust, anger etc. but my Guru
freed me from their grip as well. Further, God had
entangled me in the network of family but the Guru freed
me from this net of attachment as well. As such I can’t
leave the company of my Guru even if I have to forget all
about God.”
In fact, a Satguru has been accorded a high status
simply because it is through his Grace alone that we can
realise Param Purush.
While telling Arjun, the impotence of Guru in Gita
Vasudev Krishna says 'Arjun, He who is devoted to Guru
and sings the glory of his Guru, he will be successful.
Those who turn away from Guru, they are sinful. Just as
the holy water kept in a flask, that was used for alcohol is
not sacred. Similarly, turning away from Guru is not


Changing the world spiritually 9
sacredness. Even the deities do not accept their gifts. Their
deeds do not yield any fruit. Although kooker, sooker, kag
are worse yonis but one who turns away from Guru is
much worse. He will obviously find his place in hell.
Our holy books define 'Guru' as someone who dispels
the darkness of ignorance from the Mind. Who can show
true path to the people drowned in the worldly pleasures.
Guru provides eyes of wisdom.
There is no end to the glory of Guru. This is the reason
that Kabir Sahib highlights the glory of Guru;
Guru Ki Mahima Anant Hai, Mause Kahi Na Jaye.
Tan Man Guru Ko Saunpi Ke, Charno Rahun Samaye.
Because of greater importance of Guru, Sahib has
conjured Guru to be above God and has given the message
to be devoted to Guru.
Dhanya Mata Pita Dhanya Hai, Dhanya Suhad Anurakt.
Dhanya Gram Veh Janiye, Jahan Janme Guru Bhakt.
All the Mahapurush who have appeared on earth had
Guru. When it was Ram ji, his Guru was Vashisht muni
and during the time Krishna ji it was Durvasa rishi.
Ram Krishna Se Ko Bada, Tinhu To Guru Keen.
Teen Lok Ke Va Dhani, Guru Aage Adheen.
When even the Mahapurush needed Gurus then where
would common people go without Guru?
Hence, till the time you can't find your desirable you
should have faith but when you have found Guru you
should discover Supreme Lord within yourself. There is
category 'nursery' or KG but in private schools a student
has to sit through it for one year. In reality, this category is
only for to create an interest in children for school. They
are given happiness with all kind of play things so that they
will develop a desire to attend the school. Similarly, a
temple is made for developing desire for god in man,
however later on they definitely require a Guru.
If someone thinks that he can be a devotee without a
Guru then it like he is merrily immersed in playing with his


10 Sahib Bandgi
nursery toys, he doesn't bother in progress toward goal.
Therefore, if you wish to move forward on the spiritual
road it can only be by seeking a complete Guru.
To survive in this world we will always need the
guidance of Guru. If you wish to become a doctor, you
need a Guru. If you wish to study, you need a Guru. There
are a many books but you cannot become a doctor or
engineer just reading those books. The world in which we
live, which is familiar to us, to live here, to do something,
to move forward we need a Guide, so is the path with
which we are unfamiliar, we have no knowledge of it ,
which is beyond our understandings, how can we pass
through it without Guru. We will be lost without Guru,
completely lost. Therefore, there is a dire need for Guru.
Without Guru, alms, tap, Jap, fast etc. all are a waste.
Without Guru you can't accomplish these things.
Guru Bin Mala Ferte, Guru Bin Dete Daan.
Guru Bindaan Haraam Hai, Puchho Ved Puran.
Sahib says that it is mentioned in ved-purans that alms
given without Guru are a waste.
Jo Nigura Sumran Kare, Din Mein Sau Sau Bar.
Nagar Nayikasat Karai, Jarai Kaun Ki Lar.
If a prostitute wishes to be pure-Sati then with whom
she should burn with? Whole of the city is her husband.
Sahib says a bhajan done by a person with no Guru does
not yield any fruit. Even a person like Shukdev who had all
the knowledge right from his mother's womb didn't reach
any place after a lot of worshipping in outer world.
Garbh Yogeshwar Guru Bina, Laga Hari Ki Sev.
Kahain Kabir Vaikunth Se, Fer Diya Shukdev.
Without Guru even Vishnu ji made him return back by
saying that you have no place here as you have no Guru.
Guru Bin Hridya Shudh Na Hoi, Kotin Bhanti Kare Jo Koi.
No human could be pure without a Guru and without
being pure you can't be a devotee. Mind is a great
hindrance in this. Due to its perverted working of Mind this
world has become like this. If the mind becomes pure


Changing the world spiritually 11
somehow then this world will be at its end. This mind
never becomes pure, you need to regulate it. It can't be
controlled without the guidance and Grace of Guru, hence,
man can't purify Mind without a Guru. Under Guru's
shadow a person becomes better by inheriting his qualities.
Once, Narad ji visited Lord Vishnu and after sitting
there for some time he went his way, for some reason, he
had to revisit and found that Lord Vishnu and Goddess
Lakshmi were cleaning the place at which he was seated
before. He didn't like it and asked 'Lord, am I that dirty that
you are cleaning the place where I sat?' Lord Vishnu in all
seriousness answered 'Yes Narad, you are dirty because
you don't have a Guru'. This shocked Narad 'Lord, I am
'Brahmagyani' why would I need a Guru? 'Vishnu ji said
'No, you need to have a Guru'. Narad ji asked 'Then whom
should I take as my Guru? 'Vishnu ji told him to wander in
south direction and take the person he first sees as his
Guru. In the morning when Narad ji went in southern
direction he came across a fisherman. The fisherman had
come to check the fishes that were caught in his net at
night. Narad ji was unhappy and depressed with the turn of
events, and thought that he has lost everything truly.
However, he grudgingly went up to the fisherman and
asked him to be his Guru because of the command of
Vishnuji. He asked the Fisherman to bless him with Guru
Dikhsha. The fisherman refused while saying that he
belongs to a lower caste whereas Narad is of higher caste.
He asked Naradji "Who are you?”
Naradji said that he is Narad son of Lord Brahma. After
knowing Narad ji's identity he was shocked. It took a lot of
coaxing; Naradji told him that he has come as per the
direction of Lord Vishnu himself therefore requested him
to give Diksha. Finally, Narad ji succeeded in having the
angler as his Guru, Fisherman very reluctantly and with
fear gave Diksha to Naradji. He offered his reverential
salutation to his Guru and left for Vaikunth.


12 Sahib Bandgi
When Narad ji reached Vaikunth and he answered
Vishnu ji's query about having Guru' I have Guru but....
''Suddenly Vishnu ji silenced Narad then and there
only. 'After having Guru you are having doubts, you are
saying 'but'. 'But' means lack of faith. Even after being a
Gyani you are belittling your Guru. Go and have your way
through the eighty four yonis.'
Narad ji got scared at the prospect of experiencing
eighty four yonis. He would have to become a mouse, a
donkey, a cat, a dog he would have to go through very
lower form of dirty yonis too. He began thinking about
what to do and then went to his Guru. He told his Guru
about everything and after getting directions from his Guru
he returned to Vaikunth. He asked Vishnu ji to write all the
names of yonis through which he has to go through on a
place. When Vishnu ji wrote them Narad ji crawled
through that space from one start to end. Then he said
'Now I have gone through all eighty four yonis, now please
forgive me'. Vishnuji asked him "What has happened?"
Naradji told Vishnuji that he has gone through 84 lakh
yonis. After a moment of confusion Vishnu ji realised that
his Guru must have protected him. Vishnu ji embraced
Narad and told him about the glory of a Guru and that
Guru is the only true friend of a person because he is a
companion in both this world and the other. Lord does his
work while residing himself in Guru.
Without a Guru, even the Supreme Lord is crippled.
The path illumined by the Guru can't be shown to us by the
Lord. He was near us but we were far away from him. This
distance cannot be covered without the help of Guru hence,
never think little of Guru. Sahib Ji says-
Guru Hain Bade Govind Te, Man Mein Dekh Vichar.
Hari Sumire So Var Hai, Guru Sumire So Par.
This is an era of science. Humen are progressing in
every field. Where is the need of Guru? Can't a human do


Changing the world spiritually 13
all that by himself? What is the usefulness of Guru? Let's
take a closer look into the spiritual world.
All the holy books prescribe you not to go in the
internal world without Guru. Sahib warns you-
Yeh Ghat Mandir Prem Ka, Mat Koi Baitho Dhaye.
Jo Koi Baithe Dhaye Ke, Vo Bin Sir Seti Jaye.
Sahib says that this body is a temple of Lord; however
you should not enter without Guru. If you do that then you
will die without slaying your head.
There is lot of darkness in the internal world. It needs to
be illuminated by the light of Naam.
Shunya Mehal Mein Ghor Andhera, Karo Naam Ujiyara.
Naam Diksha is given by Guru only. Guru is a necessity.
Guru Bin Mukti Pavay Bhai, Nark Udharvamukh Vasa Pai.
Guru Bin Pade Jo Ved Purana, Tako Nahin Mile Bhagwana.
Guru Bin Pret Janam So Pavay, Varsh Sahasra Garabh
Rahavay.
Guru Bin Daan Punya Jo Karhin, Mithya Hoye Kabhun Nahin
Phalhin.
Guru Bin Bharam Na Chhute Bhai, Koti Upaaye Kare Chturai.
Nigura Kare Mukti Ki Aasa, Kaise Pavay Mukti Nivasa.
Auro Shukar Deh So Pavay, Satguru Bina Mukti Nahin Pavay.
Guru Bin Aatas Kaise Jaane, Sukh Sagar Kaise Pahichane.
Bhakti Padarath Kaise Pavay, Guru Bin Kaun Raah Batlavay.
Guru Bin Lakh Bharme Chaurasi. Janam Anek Narak Ke Vasi.
Guru Bin Pashu Janam So Pavay, Phir Phir Garabhvas Mein
Aavay.
Sahib says you can't be free without Guru. Without
Guru, being will go to hell. Those who just study Ved,
Puran without Guru, they can't grasp God. Without Guru
you go into the yoni of ghost and have to go through pain
for thousand years. Alms done without Guru do not yield
any fruit. Without Guru, you cannot get rid of delusion.
Without Guru's initiation, one cannot attain salvation. You
can't know of your-self without a Guru. Without Guru a
human keep going through eighty four yonis and will take
repeated births. Therefore-


14 Sahib Bandgi
Tehi Karan Nischay Guru Kijay,
Sur Durlabh Tan Khoye Na Deejay.
Considering all these things, a Guru is a must. You
should not waste this human body, which is even rare for
the Gods to obtain.

Guru Milney Se Jhagda Khatam Ho Gaya.
All search regarding to the realisation of soul (true self)
and Supreme Lord comes to an end when a true living
Satguru enters in your life
There are eight levels of Gurus in the world. All of these
have their own importance & role to play.
Pratham Guru Mata-Pita, Rajj Veeraj Ke So Hai Data.
Mother and Father are the first gurus whose blood and
semen combines to give birth to a child.
Doosrey Guru Garabh Ki Dayi.
The Doctor or nurse is the second Guru who helps in the
normal delivery of the child.
Teesra Guru Tahin Se Kahiye, Jihein Naam Diya Dhraye.
The third Guru is he who gives you the name. You are
being recognised with that very name.
Chautha Guru Tahin Se Kahiye, Jin Vidya Deen Padaye.
The fourth Guru is he who gives you the worldly
Knowledge.
The fifth Guru is he who performs the religious rites &
rituals. The sixth Guru is he who guides you in the matter
of worship while the seventh Guru is the Satguru himself.
Sab Se Todd Ek Se Jodi, Satguru Tiska Naam.
He clears your doubts and shows you the real path of
worship that can enable you realise Supreme Lord.
Then who is the eighth Guru?
This eighth Guru is the Shabd Guru (Satguru as sacred
word) that takes the Hansa to Param Purush. A Satguru and
the Shabd Guru are one and the same thing. A Hansa meets
Paramhansa on the 8th chakra in meditation.


Changing the world spiritually 15

2. DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A GURU AND THE
   SATGURU
   What is the difference between Guru and Satguru? If
   we consider the word Satguru then we can't find this word
   before the advent of Sant Kabir Sahib in any Scriptures.
   This word was not used before. The word was Guru. So are
   we opposing the word 'Guru'? No, earlier Gurus used to
   talk about three loks. This is a big difference. First
   difference is that Guru is mentioned in Sagun-Nirgun
   devotions. In the Sant Matt, it is Satguru. Guru has great
   importance in Sagun and Nirgun Marg, Yog Matt. But
   Guru only gives the direction on how to obtain the 'Param
   tatva', how to worship it and do sadhana. Yet, Guru will
   not take the responsibility for crossing the Ocean of Life
   and Death. To crossover this Worldly ocean of Life and
   Death, you have to make efforts and work for it. Means he
   is only an Instructor. There has been lot many Gurus with
   followers, there has been conversations between them as
   well as in battles, however Sants say-
   Guru Ka Vachan Maan Sab Leeje,
   Satya Asatya Vichar Na Keeje.
   Don't even think about it. There is a reason behind the
   glory of Satguru. Satguru will not direct you to work on
   spiritual exercises, Sadhanas. Satguru is a Savior and
   Guide who help you cross this worldly Ocean of Life.
   There is a difference between the working of two, is it not?
   Sahib doesn't ask you to work for merit (Punya Kamaye)
   and do Sadana. He is saying clearly that he will grant
   Permanent Salvation.
   Teen Lok Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Bada Na Koi.
   Karta Kare Na Kar Sake, Guru Kare So Hoye.
   Satguru Deen Dayal Ji, Tum Lag Meri Daud.
   Jaise Kaag Jahaj Par, Sujhat Aur Na Thaur.
   What is the difference? There is a great difference in
   results. Satguru awakens you (Chetan) from ignorance. He


16 Sahib Bandgi
will illumine that Supreme Spirit inside you. This has not
been granteed by anyone else before but Kabir Sahib.
To reach the truth, you should always seek Satguru.
Satguru is a complete Guru-Knower of Satya. If a Guru has
reached Sagun-Nirgun even then he can't help us to escape
from this world because his domain is only till Nirakar
Niranjan. In Sagun-Nirgun worship, the Naam given by
Guru is no 'Saar Naam', it is Word in 52 letters limit and to
be done with body. That's why a person can't reach
Amarlok with its help. Yes, you can reach Heavens,
Brahma lok, Niranjan lok; you could also be free for some
time, but after exhausting the fruit of your deeds, you
would have to come back to this world, you can't be free
forever. They call this as mukti given by God. All this
come under formless God Niranjan one cannot attain
permanent Salvation beyond Kal purush controls.
To reach Amarlok, there is need of true Naam from
Satguru (Beyond alphabets, Sound less Sar Naam). You
can't reach there with your own power, own merits. To
get there you need grace of Satguru. Firstly, The Power
of Naam will take you there. But, even if you are
hindered on the way, then Satguru's grace will help you
on the way and up to the end. (Path of Grace)
Niranjan and Adi Maya do not allow anyone to go
beyond this universe. They also don't want anyone to go
even in to the inner worlds. They confuse the being with
different type of obstacles and delude jivi. So that there is
no way anyone could cross the limits of Niranjan. Niranjan
and Maya use their full power to pull back the being. Even
after crores of attempts, the being can't get away from here.
Satguru takes the jivi across the Worldly Ocean of Life by
giving his own power. It is said-
Kete Padhi Guni Pachi Muye, Yog Yagya Tap Laye.
Bin Satguru Pawe Nahin, Koi Kotin Kare Upaye.
So come, let's head toward complete Guru, means
towards a Satguru. In the present age, there are thousands


Changing the world spiritually 17
of religious organizations in India and lakhs of Gurus.
Nearly, there are appx. 60 lakh registered Gurus and
several lakhs which are unregistered. The majority of these
Gurus are collecting money in the name of supreme lord to
lead a luxurious life and feeding their own families. They
spend their lives in style and pomp.
Bahut Guru Hain As Jag Mahin,
Haren Dravya Dukh Kou Nahin.
An ordinary devotee is not considerate enough to
choose a true Satguru. They are often involved in
sleepwalking. Hence, those who seek truth should be
cautious. They shouldn't do what others are doing. 'Guru'
and 'Satguru'. You should understand it or if you consider a
simple Guru as Satguru then you won't reach Amarlok, you
would only may reach up to Vaikunth or as such.
The one who gives the knowledge of Sagun-Nirgun
devotion is a normal Guru; however, the one who teaches
the devotion of Param Purush is a Satguru. Everyone in
this world is becoming Satguru nowadays. This is enough
to distract a being. There are some who keep talking about
'Satlok' but they have never reached there.
If a Guru is giving the knowledge of Sagun-Nirgun
devotion to follow, know that he is not a Satguru.
......But these Gurus have reached there or not, how
to decide this? Sahib knew that it is Kaliyug, even fake
Guru will try to distract beings therefore he has told the
features of a Satguru which has been accepted by Sants.
In truth, the words Satguru and Sant can't be found
before the era of Sants (15th century). This word has been
given by Kabir Sahib first. Earlier there used to be talk of
Guru, Sagun-Nirgun devotion, but Sahib talked about
Devotion to Satguru as Satya Bhakti. He is known as first
Sant-Satguru. In truth, he was not a Sant. He was the
King of Sants, a 'Sant Samrat'. He produced Sants.
Therefore, his sayings are accepted by all Sants. Those
who walked on Sahib's words, He took them for the


18 Sahib Bandgi
Dharsan of Sat Purush. Those who have returned from
Amarlok are called Sant-Satguru.
Sahib has told the identity of a true Satguru while
talking about features of a Satguru he says-
Guru Ke Lakshan Kehat Haun, Suno Dheer Chitlaye|
Sahib has mentioned the first feature as 'Nirvasna'. We
should understand this feature so that we don't get confused
in our quest for Satguru.

1. Nirvasana; Free from lust:-it means the one who doesn't
   reside in company of a woman. If he is a celibate from
   childhood then he has never fell into the web of maya.
   Gyan Chadriya Jisne Lini, Maili Kar Dhar Dini.
   Ek Kabir Jatan Se Lini, Jyon Kityon Dhar Dini.
   Marriage means the seeking of sensual pleasure and the
   person lost in this pleasure could not be a true Guru. If a
   Guru is lost in this type of pleasure then he is not known
   the pleasure of the Soul 'Atma'. Then, how could he take
   disciple away from sensual pleasure to bliss of self. Sahib
   says- Jaka Guru Hai Geerhi, Chela Girhi Hoye.
   Kich Kich Ke Dhovte, Mail Na Jave Koye.
   If the Guru is a House holder, the disciple will also do
   the same because a dirt spot can't be cleaned with dirt.
   Therefore, Kabir Sahib has asked, to seek a celibate
   Guru. If finding this type of Guru is very difficult than try
   to find a type of Guru who has left all worldly affairs and
   luxuries after attaining knowledge. To sit on the Seat of
   Guru the sacrifice of all the senses is a must. A disciple has
   to surrender his mind, body, and wealth to his Guru.
   Therefore,
   Tan Man Vako Dijiye, Jaake Vishya Nahin|
   Nanak dev ji says-
   Yeh Duniya Sakli Taji, Liyo Vaish Vairag.
   Keh Nanak Sun Re Mana, Ta Ghat Brahm Nivas.
   If we observe the present day Gurus based on this
   feature, majority will fail.
2. Nirbandhan; Detachment:-It means that he should not
   have a deep relationship with Brother, Sister, Daughter,


Changing the world spiritually 19
Son, or any other relative. He should be wholly related to
his Disciples. If he has any affection toward his family
members then he would use all money for them, diverting
from a good deed. Apart from this, in the end, there would
be nepotism. When he leaves, he would hand over his
position to his son or any near relative, even if that person
is not suitable for that position. Sahib Ji says-
Beej Bindu Nahin Chale Guruai, Naad Bind Se Chale Guruai.
Kabir Sahib says that the successor can only be
'shabdputar'. If someone is giving his position to his
relative then that person is stuck in maya. Then the work of
your Soul cannot be accomplished.
Bandhe Ko Bandhamile, Chhoote Kaun Upaye.
Kar Sewa Nirbandh Ki, Pal Main Laye Chhudaye.

3. Saaragarhi: Nondependent:-Guru should eat only from
   his own earnings. He shouldn't depend on others for his
   food or even from the money of his followers. Sahib says-
   Mangan Maran Saman Hai, Mat Koi Mango Bheekh.
   Mangan Te Marna Bhala, Satguru Dete Seekh.
   If a Guru is eating by taking money from others then
   the Disciple would also do the same. They would be
   reducing to beggars. Therefore, Sahib says-
   Pura Satguru Na Mila, Suni Adhoori Seekh.
   Swang Yati Ka Pahin Ke, Ghar Ghar Mangi Bheekh.
4. Nirlobhi; Non-greedy:-Guru should not keep his eyes on
   his follower's wealth. The money donated by the followers
   should be used for good deeds and not for personal usage.
   So understand-
   Guru Lobhi Shishya Lalchi, Dono Khele Daanv.
   Dono Boodhe Bapure, Chadi Pathar Ki Naav.
5. Satyavaan; Truthful:-Truth has been considered as the
   basis of all Religions by all Sants.
   Sanch Barabar Tap Nahin, Jhooth Barabar Paap.
   Jake Hridya Saanch Hai, Taake Hridya Aap.
   Guru who is a truthful person can take his Disciples
   towards truth. To reach there, Sahib has pressed on the
   truthiness of the Guru, Disciple, and the Naam.


20 Sahib Bandgi
Guru Satya Naam Satya Ho, Aaap Satya Jo Hoi|

6.Sarvagyi; Knowledge:- Guru should have the knowledge
of all the holy books. He should have complete knowledge
of internal worlds. Only then he can clear his Disciple's
doubts. Sahib says-
Ja Guru Te Bhram Na Mite, Bhranti Na Jiv Ka Jaye.
So Guru Jhootha Janiye, Tyagat Der Na Laye.

7. Ekroop; Seventh feature:-The grandest of all the
   features is that his Soul should have merged with the
   Supreme lord, Sahib in real time.
   Satpurush Ko Jansi, Tiska Satguru Naam|
   Guru who has the above six features have the seventh
   feature and the one with all seven features is one complete
   Guru, a Sant Satguru. A Satguru is one who can represent
   Supreme lord, Param Purush fully.
   If you are on quest for a complete Guru then you should
   consider all the seven features while doing that. The one
   with all these features is a complete Guru. If you can't find
   these features then Kabir Sahib says-
   Jab Tak Guru Mile Nahin Sancha,
   Tab Tak Guru Karo Das Pancha.
   A common doubt among the devotees is that they think
   if you have a Guru before then you are committing a sin by
   going for another Guru. It's not like that. In the above said
   verses, Kabir Sahib has said that till you find a complete
   Guru, Satguru, you can have five to ten Gurus, it's not a sin
   because finding a complete Guru is a difficult task.
   However after finding one, if you keep other Gurus also,
   then, it is like deep sea dive where you find a Gem after
   many attempts, and then you throw it back. You should
   know that without Satguru there is no one to take you
   accross this Worldly Ocean of Life and Death. None else
   can be of help...
   Satguru Ke Updesh Ka, Suniya Ek Vichar.

Changing the world spiritually 21
Unte Kabhu Na Chhutta, Firta Charon Khani.
Chari Khani Mein Bharmta, Kabhun Na Lagta Par.
So Fera Sab Miti Gya, Satguru Ke Upkar.
While giving the secret of Satguru to Dharamdas, Sahib
says-
Bhring Mata Hoye Jehi Pasa, Soi Guru Satya Dharamdasa|
Kabir Sahib says that one who has the Bhringa mata is
a real Satguru. What is this Bringa Matt? There are 27 lakh
insects in existence. 'Bhringa' is the most distinct in them.
There are only males, no females among them. Then how
do they populate? It catches larva of another insect. He
makes a habitat of Mud. He has great speed and has an
endearing voice. The voice is very attractive and it helps
him in turning the insect into himself. If the insect does not
listen, it cannot change in to another Bringa. 'Bhringa'
place the insect and fly around it. It sounds to the insect at
the end. If the insect does not listen to it, the process is
repeated again. If the insect listens to it, it becomes just
like him another Bringa. It make three attempts, before
discarding it. It remained as an insect not become a Bringa.
It will try with another larve and repeat the process.
Similar is the work of Satguru. He passes the shabad
(ear cannot grasp) in to his disciple with his concentration-
Paras Surti. The insect doesn't do anything. He is captured
by 'Bhringa', words are also by him. The insect only has to
accept. If it does not listen then how can it transform.
Observe here, if the Satguru is complete then you will
undergo automatic changes. Mind will come under control.
Sahib says-
Bhringi Shabd Keet Jo Mana, Varan Fer Aapan Kar Jana|
The larvae of insect which listen to 'Bhringa' will
become the Bhringa himself after losing his own features
and characteristics. If it is Beetle, then it will give up its
characteristics and become a Bringa. A wasp will become a
Bringa.
Koi Koi Keet Param Sukhdai, Pratham Avaj Gahe Chitlai|


22 Sahib Bandgi
Sahib says some insects are lucky who accepts the word
in first attempt and turns in to a Bringa.
Koi Dooje Koi Teeje Mane, Tan Man Rahit Shabd Hit Jane|
Some accept it in second or third shabd. These insects
are somewhat difficult.
Bhringi Shabd Keet Na Gahai, Tau Puni Keet Aasre Rahai|
But the insect who does not listen to shabd even after
all these tries, he will remain the same.
Gurushabd Nischay Satya Mane, Bhringi Mat Tab Pawai.
Taji Sakal Asa Shabd Basa, Kaga Hans Kahavai.
Similarly, Satguru's shabad is blissful. In its sound boo
boo there is a vibration. Some insects could not be
converted in first try. Why? Because they are not
dedicated. The change will only occur once you are
dedicated. After three attempts, Bhringa goes in search of
other Larvae.
To Puni Keet Aasre Rahai.......
Then the insect remains the same. This is abnormal. It
did not surrender, this surrender is unique.
Pehle Data Shishya Bhaya, Jin Tan Man Arpa Sheesh.
Peeche Data Satguru Bhaya, Jin Naam Diya Bakhsheesh.
Everyone is talking about the 'Sehaj Marg' but with
earnings of Merits by deeds and Jap etc. However these are
poles apart. Sahib says that you don't have to do anything.
Satguru will do all the things. You will possess these things
naturally. These will include knowledge, devotion, and
control over mind, strength, and spiritual powers. You will
ask that if we don't make the effort then how is it possible.
After getting Naam who is controlling this 'we'. Guru's
power is the one controlling it so, never bring 'I', simply
agree with it, and surrender.
Someone said that if everything is due to Guru's
influence then the cheating done by us must also be by his
wish. I said, listen I will give you the full answer. This
happens when we are not dedicated completely. When you
are surrender completely then, we will never go wrong
even if we wish to. Now you walk with faith. Destiny


Changing the world spiritually 23
directs and as per your action you will reap the reward.
You will get fruits according to your deeds. Assume you
have to fell in well then it will happen. But if you are
dependent on Satguru, then Satguru shifts your deeds to
one side. The incident does not happen.
Koti Karam Pal Mein Kate, Jo Aave Guru Ot|
Whatever work you do, Satguru's power will protect
you from all the losses and mishaps. Whatever happens it
is always in your favors just has faith in him and takes all
as his will. Meaning of this is that he will do everything;
you don't have to do anything.
Sruti Karau Mum Saiyaan, Hum Hain Bhavjal Mahin.
Aap Hi Hum Beh Jayenge, Jo Na Gahoge Bahin.
Means Sahib indicated that he will change the destiny.
How will he do that, by changing you like himself? That is
why you need not do circumbulation. There are many
Gurus in this world who say that they will liberate you. But
when you take a look at their followers you will observe
that there is no transformation in them. Means they are not
Real Gurus. Therefore, Sahib warns by saying-
Bhrung Matta Hoye Jihi Pasa, Soi Guru Satya Dharmdasa|
Like Bhrunga changes the insect without any effort,
similarly Guru does the same to his pupil without any
effort on pupil's side. One who has Bhrunga Matta is a
Complete Guru, Satguru.
You do see your habits are inherited by your children.
It is of your genes. Satguru's Surati reach out to the Soul
of his pupil. He will possess all the things easily Sahib Ji
points to such Satguru who like bringa has the power to
transform. "Guru Milney Se Jadgada Katam Hogaya" The
Spiritual quest comes to an end, in the path of Yog, there
is no such method.
What is 'Sehaj-Marg'? All the responsibility is of
Guru. You will come out of web of maya, you will get rid
of your evil tendencies, and a guard will always stand on,
for your protection. It would be like- Mera Hari Mauko


24 Sahib Bandgi
Bhaje, Main Soun Paanv Pasar| This is 'Sehaj-Marg'. You
don't have to do anything. This is 'Bhrung Matt'.
Guru Ko Keeje Dandvat, Koti Koti Pranam.
Keet Na Jane Bhrung Ko, Karile Aap Saman.
When a person is in doubt what to do? Everyone is
saying different things. We can't get rid of maya with our
own power. This work is accomplished by the power of
Satguru's Naam.
The one who asks you to do something, to earn
through action-Karma, understand that he is not a Sant
but an imposter, a fake who doesn't have the experience
but is speaking only from books. A Sant Satguru is
capable and competent but others are not. Sants talk
about what they have seen with their eyes, Sants visit
Amarlok in reality, a fake one hasn't even seen Amarlok
in their dreams. It's a fact that you can't see Amarlok in
Dreams. Then to reach there in reality is very hard
possibility. Therefore the one who has No methodology of
bringa, he will be a burden to you because he has kept
you in delusion. Imbibe this in your hear, the one who
asks you earn merit, do Sadhana, you should know that
such type of person is bent on destroying you, because he
doesn't know that-
Na Kuchh Kiya Na Kari Saka, Na Karne Yog Shareer.
Jo Kuchh Kiya Sahib Kiya, Bhaya Kabir Kabir.
The person who is asking you to earn merits through
actions implies he wants to say that he has also gained
everything with his own earnings. This clarifies that he has
never set a foot in Amarlok. His Guru also can't be a Sant.
He is not associated to Sant-matt or Bhring-matta. He is a
liar who is drowning you with himself in this world. His
aim is to earn money not your mukti.
In India, Naam is given by placing hand on the head
of Disciple. People say that they have gotten Naam on TV
or through Public address System. No, this is not the
proper way. Someone asked me if you had to give Naam


Changing the world spiritually 25
Dhaan to thousand people at once then still will you place
hand on their heads? I replied that even if I had to give
Naam to one lakh people, I would still follow the same
practice because this is the proper method to give Naam
Dhaan. Because the rays have to be passed in to the
pupil.
An alcohol addict came for Naam and it has been few
days since he stopped drinking. He asked me for Naam
Dhaan. I told him to wait for some time to stay in control.
He went to another mahatma and took Naam from him. He
began abusing his own Guru. According to him, he was
given Naam while he was in drunken state. His Guru had
no knowledge of him, his own pupil. Hence, it is said-
Pani Pijiye Chhani Se, Guru Keeje Jani Ke.
That Guru was only interested in increasing his number
of pupils. I caution the society of these types of people who
are not even bothered by what you are doing. If your Guru
has no knowledge of your deeds then he cannot transform
you, because when kaal will arrive to collect your Soul he
wouldn't be aware and your Soul he will lose you
somewhere. Such false guru cannot save you from Kal
Purush. Therefore you have to search for Satguru.
Remember Sahib's words-
Bhring Mata Hoye Jihi Pasa, Soi Guru Satya Dharamdasa|
Guru Govind Dou Khade, Kake Lagun Paye. Balihari Guru
Aapno, Jin Govind Diyo Bataye.
Guru was equaled to God before Sants. Our Holy Scriptures and
sages have given even equal status to Guru and God. However,
Sants brought a revolution in the spiritual field. They placed
Satguru even above God.
_“Guru Hain Badey Gobind Se, Mann Dekh Vichaar, Hari
Sumrey Soh Vaar Hai, Guru Sumrey Soh Paar”._
Kabir sahib ji in his ideology of Sant Matt reveals that “Satguru
is greater than supreme Lord” No one can’t meditate on one
whom he has not seen, whereas Meditating on true Satguru will
provide all help and protection to a being and will also provide
Permanent Salvation-Param Mukti.


26 Sahib Bandgi

## 3. What Satguru Does?

What happens after we receive Naam? What will Guru
Do?
At present, your Soul has forgotten its true identity by
being stuck in this web of mind and maya. During the time
of Naam initiation, Satguru separates Mind from Soul.
Soul pervades the whole of body. He concentrates it on an
Agya chakra. After that mind can't possess it again. Now
slowly, the pupil begins to understand Soul. This is a work
of Satguru. He didn't grant any power to the Soul. It's
already powerful due to being a part of Param Purush. It
doesn't need extra power. Guru only removes the fog of
Mind and Maya from it. Which make it possible to see it
self. Sahib has clarified it as-
Bina Staguru Nar Firat Bhulana|
Khojat Firat Na Milat Thikana||
Sahib says with beautiful narration, It tells about how
Man has forgotten a true Satguru even without a thought.
Kehar Sut Ik Aan Gadariya|Pal Pos Ke Kiyo Sayana||
'Kehar' means lion. 'sut' is its offspring .Once a cub got
mixed up in a flock of goats and their owner took him in.
Pal Pos Ke Kiyo Sayana|
He got separated from his mother. He couldn't find her.
Now, he started living with sheep and goats.
Karat Kalol Firat Anjiyan Sang|
Aapan Maran Unhun Na Jana||
'Aja' means goat.'kalol' means playing. He used to play
with the goats. He didn't knew that he is a lion. Time
passed by. He began eating grass. Why did he began to eat
grass? Your own children eat soil. Sense of tongue is very
strong in a child. There is an element in it. It is not an
edible material. It contains toxins. But it becomes a habit
which is a very deteriorating habit.
Soul also has a bad habit of residing with senses. My
nephew used to eat soil. His mother mentioned it to me .I
told her not to keep soil in the house. After that she said


Changing the world spiritually 27
that he eats it from outside. I then told her to prohibit him
from going outside. Then she said that he eats it from the
sole of the shoes. See, it is a deteriorating habit. I told her
to keep shoes at an elevation. Now he began licking walls.
Now, the walls are not to be broken for that, right? This is
Mind.
Teen Lok Mein Manhin Viraji|Tahin Na Chirhat Pandit Kaji||
Later I made him understand and even frighten him not
to eat Soil. Soil is not edible. Similarly, grass is not in the
list of a lion's meal.
There is a calf. Whenever, I give food to his mother, he
would bend to suckle my toe. He has suckled both of them.
It is not a thing to eat, but he was hungry.
Maybe, the cub began to eat grass because he couldn't
find anything else. He saw that others were eating and it
also did the same eat grass. He began fighting and speaking
just like a goats. He didn't roar. His very existence
transformed him in to that of the goat. He himself became
a goat. How can a lion become a goat? Association of
goats greatly influenced this.
Mrigpati Aur Jangal Se Ayo|Tahi Dekh Vo Bahu Darana||
Now whenever goats were beaten, same fate will befall
on the lion cub. If he ran away, then he was captured. Can
a human capture a lion? No, it was a result of being with
the goats. He was lost. So-
Mrigpati Aur Jangal Se Ayo|Pal Pos Kar Kiyo Sayana||
'Lion' is known as 'mrigpati' King of the Jungle. A deer
can jump up to 27 feet. Lion jumps up to 28 feet. It's in the
nature of the lion to hunt by frightening his prey and make
him run for his life. You always eat food by cooking fully.
He loves the challenge which he get from the deer. It's his
favorite food, he is fascinated by it. But a lion who tastes
human blood once doesn’t like to hunt other Animals. He
craves for human blood only. He just wants the human
flesh. This is because human's flesh is meat. If he opts for a


28 Sahib Bandgi
bear then firstly he had to pass through a layer of hairs to
reach the flesh.
Then, there was the arrival of another lion. The cub got
scared just by gazing at the other lion.
Tahi Dekh Vo Bahu Darana||
Lion saw that there was a lion's child wandering
alongside a flock of goats and he was also getting beaten
up. This is against the lion's standards. He went to the
child. The cub got frightened.
There once was a human in a group of languors. What
was he doing? He was jumping in exact manner as
languors. No human can wander the trees at this rate. He
had become a languor while living among them.
Now, the question arises that how did it happen? He
was human. There are two to three facts. Firstly, there is
90% similarity between humans and languors. But there is
another technical reason why was he leaping and jumping?
Because the body became flexible with fruits and milk. He
must have been drinking milk of the female languor from
an early age.
I read in a newspaper that a bitch used to feed a human
baby, who was dumped on a heap of waste. She used to go
every day. This was the bitch's affection.
May be female languor also did the same and even the
child assumed her to be his mother too. Slowly, he began
inheriting all the habits of languors but his physical
structure was of human. Fruits and milk will make a man
fast.
I am not saying you to not eat grains. Because people
have a way to twist my words. One day somebody asked
me if cow is the mother then what is a buffalo? People
query. Buffalo is off the radar for two things. Buffalo
firstly makes her own body but in case of cow, she will
return you the same you provide her.
Honestly- Jiska Pijiye Doodh|Tisko Kahiye Maye||


Changing the world spiritually 29
So, that human child became languor. He got isolated
from humans. He was leaping because he drank their milk
and inherited their traits. He learned to communicate with
languor through their language. A child's memory is quite
strong.
Some people arrived and said to Gurudev that this is
Kaliyug, a human child has become languor. So, Gurudev
told about this incidence.
He was biting like languor, he was being irritated from
humans like langoors and also he was hanging upside
down. Maybe, it was the same fate that befell on that lion
cub. A cow gave birth to a calf and died the next day. Then
another cow began to feed him. After some time he was
being fed from a bottle. Firstly, there was some struggle
but afterwards he learnt that there was no other way.
Similarly, our Soul has been deteriorated by mind and
senses. Therefore, the lion of the forest saw that the other
one was eating grass. He was amused. When he went
towards the other lion that was trembling with fear, he tried
to sooth his nerves. The other believed that he was a goat
and that he was going to be feast for the lion.
Pakad Bhed Tahi Samjhana||
He took the Cub towards a lake and he told him to look
at their reflection. He told him that he is also was a lion,
they looked alike. He taught him everything. He taught him
how to use the claws, how to roar. He possessed that
power. Similarly, Soul's power has not lessened, it has just
got suppressed due to mind.
Sabki Gadhri Lal Hai|Koi Nahin Kanga||
Therefore... Mrigpati Aur Jangal Se Ayo||
So when the lion of the forest came, he taught him
everything. Pakde Bhed Tahi Samjhana||
His true identity was shown to him in the reflection of
water. He was told that he got separated from his mother.
He was taught everything then he went back to the flock of
goats, the Herds man hit him just as he used to. Even as he


30 Sahib Bandgi
did, the lion roared causing everyone to run away in fear.
The moral of the story is that lion cub as Child of Param
Purush was feeding on grass (Lust) like Goats (senses),
Mind (Sheppard) was hitting the Cub. When Sant arrive in
the form of lion of forest, they take you to the fountain of
Agyachakra and show that you are a Soul.
Its power has never decreased. However, where was the
power? Does power had become like that of goats? No,
even after living with goats, he had the power of a lion.
Power didn't change. It was there. It was change in nature.
Due to association with Goats he became like them. The
moment he met the lion he was shown his true identity.
When Sants meet, they awaken the Soul. Senses in
form of Goat become frightened. There is no power of
mind after that.
That's how you are transformed. How this
transformation does occurs? Atamdev understands his
power that without my wish nothing can happen. Your
desires vanish and you stabilize in the state of Soul. You
become incredible. Now there is no confusion. The
attraction towards worldly things vanish. How did it
vanish? Just like, in confusion you get frightened for
seeing a rope as a snake. When you gain knowledge,
confusion evaporates. Then, even if you want to feel fear,
you won't be able to. Similarly, there would be no joy in
worldly affairs even if you want to.
Satguru Mor Shoorma, Kaskar Mara Ban|
Naan Akela Reh Gya, Paya Pad Nirvan||
Satguru Has Done Indispensable Deed|

So, mind has a lot of control. It confuses the Soul. Guru
help you transcend your mind by showing the true form of
Soul.
Koti Janm Ka Panth Tha|Guru Pal Mein Diya Pahunchaye||


Changing the world spiritually 31
This work is done the moment Guru gives the Naam
Dhaan. Kabir Sahib has never said a lie, nothing is said in
vain. He says-
Guru Samana Shishya Mein, Shishya Liya Kar Neh|
Bilgaye Bilge Nahin, Ek Roop Do Deh||
Does Disciple possess traits of the Guru in reality?
Jab Main Tha To Guru Nahin, Ab Guru Hain Main Nahin|
Prem Gali Ati Sankari, Jamein Do Na Samahin||
It will be evident from the experience. It is clear from
these words, that Disciple can acquire the Guru's traits in
reality. Sahib says' Ab Guru Hey Mey Naahi _..._ It is clear
that two facts are in light. It means that guru can manifest
in disciple his qualities, further 'Bilgaye Bilge Nahin'. It
means, they can become mirror images. In reality, it is
possible. Then Sahib says-
Paras Mein Aru Sant Mein, Tu Bado Antro Jan|
Veh Loha Kanchan Kare, Veh Karle Aap Saman||
These words take one to a point in reality. Such is
Spiritual genisism. There is a Spiritual level, a great state
that being attains and this is done in a moment. This was a
doubt, this is alright- Guru Karle Aap Saman||
A doctor can make anybody a doctor. An engineer can
make anybody an engineer. But both of them take a lot of
time to take out the above said from themselves. It takes
them 4-5 years. But Satguru does this work in a moment.
He transfers his Wisdom, qualities, habits, powers along
with other things in a moment of time. This is a magical
topic. Evidence is here.
Guru Ko Keeje Dandhvat, Koti Koti Pranam|
Keet Na Jane Bhring Ko, Guru Karle Aap Saman||
Sometimes you try to sense each other’s, you try to
bring other to our level, but it's often incomplete. Children
are asked to do good deeds, not to lie etc, but you don't
always do which is told to them yourself. But Sahib says
that Guru makes you alike himself.
What is that formula with which a complete Guru
makes you alike himself? This is a very big thing. Science


32 Sahib Bandgi
is unable to explain this concept. What is this thing? How
does change happen? What is the truth in it, its origin, has
it any wastage? There is proof which suggests that this is
possible.
Why does a human want to see 'Supreme Lord'?
Because there is a Nature that whoever sees him becomes
like him. Now why are you concentrating? This is a very
special thing. Even without proper knowledge, human
knows that he will be able to reach the Lord with his
concentration. Means concentration has the power to reach
the Lord and talk to him. There are powers in
concentration.
Sometimes, we ask a Mahatma has to see whether our
work would be successful or not, with concentration
(Surati). It means Guru sees with the power of
concentration or 'Dhyan'. The parents can't do this. They
can only change physique not the personality. They can't
make us like themselves. Sahib mentions-
Paras Mein Are Sant Mein, Tu Bado Antro Jan|
Veh Loha Anchan Kare, Guru Karle Aap Saman||
Here is an example. When you first came in contact
with me, I changed your personality first. I removed the
earlier one and filled it with Madurai-sweetness. Now your
thoughts, your nature will begin to match with me. It will
not be similar to parents. You say that son is not good,
don't know whom he is following, to be like that but this is
an art of Guru. Sahib says a Guru makes you similar to
himself just like a 'Bhringa' it is also known as Bandarin, a
kind of wasp. What is Brunga Mata? There are 27 Lakhs,
kinds of Insects; Brunga is unique among them. They have
only male form, they have no mother. How do they
procreate? It creates a Mud House. There is a miraculous
effect in his sound. It flies very fast. They catch hold of
any Larvae of insect, keeps the Larva in the mud house and
transmits its sound; its sound is very endearing. With this
sound, it transforms the Larvae into a Brunga, like itself.


Changing the world spiritually 33
Sahib says that Satguru also changes his disciple like
himself. There are proofs to deduce that. Whenever you are
seeing your personality, you get to see a change in that.
You must have found this change amusing. One day
Avatar Singh told me that he felt like there is no human on
the earth that is worse than him. I was committing all kind
of bad deeds. Now I feel that there is no one better than I
am. I have transformed. He said that even if he had been on
penance from birth he could not have achieved such a
change. Sahib tells the truth-
Satguru Mor Rangrez, Chunri Mori Rang Dari.....
You Have Been Changed. It Is Mentioned-
Jab Main Tha To Guru Nahin, Ab Guru Hai Main Nahin|
Prem Gali Ati Sankari, Tamein Do Na Samahin||
Actually what does Gurudev do? Today we all are
residing in an era of science. Clones are being made. The
clones are made of goats, of humans but they are changing
only the appearances not the nature of that being. That is
out of the league of scientists. Then what is that a Sant
possesses that he is able for a transformation.
Paras Surti Sant Ke Pasa......
There is a power in the surti. Just like a droplet that turn
into a pearl in the shell. This mechanism is inside the shell.
However, the scientists does not have the ability to turn the
droplet into pearl. No one has been able to do that, this
can't be done by a scientist. He is not equipped for this.
The mechanism in the core of the deer creates Kasturi
(Musk). Kasturi is semen of the deer. But nobody has been
able to create Kasturi from chemicals. Similarly, the Surti
of a Satguru has the power to change you. What is
Meditation-concentration? This concentration is Soul.
When it reaches there, everything else disappears, there
remains only the concentration, surti. It reaches in front of
Param Purush by abandoning the worldly body. It's not in
its physical power to reach there. Only nose has power of
smelling, ears can't do it. That Param Purush can only be


34 Sahib Bandgi
known by the Soul. It means that the Soul has the power. It
awakens. This is found in nearness of Mahapurush. A
difference is made by their presence. You pray to keep his
Dhyan on you, his surti on you, to your Guru. Why is it so?
When an umbrella is opened, it protects you from rain. By
staying under his shadow, you will feel different. You
know that you will get it. Just like that his concentration is
effective. That's why Sahib says-
Surti Mein Rachyo Sansara|Surti Ka Khel Sara||
The most distinguishable one in your nature is surti.
Surti Sambhale Kaj Hai|Tu Mat Bharam Bhulaye||
If there is something which is lost in this world, it is
concentration and the one which is booming and regressing
is mind. It is confusing our surti.
We ask our Gurus to illumine our heart. What could be
done? Yes! What type of light? Is there a bulb to light?
What is meant by the light in the heart? What type of light
is needed?
Shunya Mehal Mein Gh Or Andhera|Karo Naam Ujiyara||
Guru awakens your Soul with this light means surti.
You are able to see the impurities in your heart. If darkness
persists in the room, you cannot see anything. You are able
to see everything in light. When Guru illumines your heart,
you are able to see all the plays of Mind, you are able to
sense lust and anger etc. There is no need for lightening a
bulb or a lamp. Is there light? Absolutely. Sahib says-
Naam Bin Hridya Shudh Na Ho| Kotin Bhanti Kare Jo Koi||
Therefore Naam Dhan illuminates one's heart. Now you
have changed a lot. Earlier, you used to do whatever your
mind wishes but now there is no power of mind. Nature
has changed. You can't do evil deeds even if you want to.
If you weigh your life of earlier times, you will find that
there has been a drastic change. Every Naami can
experiences this change. I am say that "The thing that I
possess can't be find anywhere in this Universe". It
results in three things. Firstly, Mind and Soul get


Changing the world spiritually 35
separated. Secondly, the attraction of world vanishes.
Third, Heart is illumined. Socrates says blind is not a
person who has no eyes but blind is a person who can't see
his own defects. If you attempt a wrong action the Naam
will warn you from within. Knowledge has been infused.
The power of discrimination strengthens.
See, explosions are happening in the universe. There is
a planet greater than sun which is experiencing these types
of blasts since May, 2007. It is very far away, thus, its
pieces will not reach here. Asteroids of great sizes have
breached earth. They have shaken earth. It created 150km
creator and changed the world. It is going on even right
now. Scientists keep an eye on this. A common man can't
see it. There is lot going on in your body.
Chasme Dil Se Dekh Tu|Kya Kya Tamashe Ho Rahe.....
You can't see those blasts. Scientists are witnessing it
from NASA center. You are watching the sky but you can't
see it. Just like that you are unable to see your internal
enemies. I gave a spectacle with which you can see your
inner enemies, can observe the defects. This is not normal.
Common man can't see it. Next, you get a complete
protection. I have given the power of Param Purush. A
child doesn't worry about when to eat, where to sleep, it’s
taken care by the mother, it knows it by heart. That is
definite. Mother is a conserver. Similarly, Satguru is also a
conserver. You find yourself distinct from the other people.
Other people are under the control of Mind but you have a
hold on your Mind.
A Mahatma has in him the power to transform. World is
empty, I will change you.
What does Satguru do while giving Naam? It’s
summarised as below.....

1. Firstly, Surti of Sevak is awakened. The seven places
   where mind had bound Surti, it is made free. Soul is
   separated from Mind and linked with Surti.


36 Sahib Bandgi

2. Awakened Surti illumines the heart. All the Games of
   Mind can be understood.
3. A power is assigned to the pupil during the Naam-Dhan
   which protects him at every moment.
   No one can win over mind in this world.
   Manhin Niranjan Sabay Nachavay|Naam Hoye To Math Namavay||
   What is Naam? There is a system in the Surti of
   Satguru. _‘_ Paras Surti Sant Ke Pasa _’_
   Paras Mein Aru Sant Mein, Tu Bado Antro Jan|
   Veh Loha Kanchan Kare, Guru Karle Aap Saman||
   Satguru Mor Shoorma, Kaskar Mara Ban|
   Naam Akela Reh Gya, Paya Pad Nirvan||
   Satguru Gives Param Moksh after cutting the all the ties
   of Mind and Maya by giving Naam.

Satguru transforms you and makes you like himself.
Purush Rachan Te Nari Hai, Nari Rachan Te Purush.
Purushe Purushe Je Racha, Te Virla Sansar.
There is a hidden secret in every message of Sahib. _‘Purush
Rachan Te Nari Hai’_ i.e. Supreme Lord created Adi Shakti.
This can be understood. Then Adi Shakti gave birth to Brahma,
Vishnu and Mahesh i.e. **‘** Nari Rachan Te Purush **.’** This fact can
also be understood. We can understand up to this point. After
this he says- Puruhe Purushe Je Racha **..............**
How can a man create another man? ‘Yes, of course!’
Genesism will not accept this fact. The day the Satguru gives
the holy Naam, he does spiritual genesism in the disciple. He
transforms your personality similar to himself through his
concentration. At this point Sahib has said-
Jab Main Tha To Guru Nahin, Ab Guru Hai Main Naahin.
Prem Gali Ati Sankari, Ta Mein Dui Na Samahin.

## 4. Souls are under veil.

The one whom Sants have called 'Sahib' is Param
Purush. He is our beloved. Every being is a part of him. He
is an ocean of Bliss The living Souls are restrained in this
world after separating from him. Let's see how that
happened.
Once Dharamdas ji prayed and asked Kabir ji about
Amar lok and the beginning of world-
Ab Sahib Mohi Deu Batai, Amar Lok So Kahan Rahai.
Kaun Dweep Hans Ko Vasa, Kaun Dweep Purush Reh Vasa.
Teen Lok Utpati Bhakho, Varnhuskal Goye Jani Rakho.
Kaal-Niranjan Kis Vidhi Bhayayu,Kaise Shodash Sut Nirmayu.
Kaise Char Khani Bistari, Kaise Jeev Kalvash Dari.
Traye Deva Kaun Vidhi Bhayayu, Kaise Mahi Akash Nirmayu.
Chandra Surya Kahu Kaise Bhayayu, Kaise Taragan Sab
Dhayayu.
Kis Vidhi Bhai Sharir Ki Rachna,Bhasho Sahib Utpati Bachna.
Sahib! Please tell me where is that Amar lok? Where do
the beings live there? How three loks does came to be?
How Kal-Purush does came into being? What about the
sixteen sons? How did Souls stuck into the web of kal-
Purush? How trinity did came to be? How did earth and
sky formed? How was body formed? Sahib! Please tell me
the whole secret of the formation of this world. Then,
Kabir Sahib said to Dharamdas ji-
Tab Ki Bat Sunhu Dharandasa, Jab Nahin Mahi Patal Akasha.
Jab Nahi Kurm Varaha Aur Shesha,Jab Nahi Sharad Gori Ganesh.
Jab Nahin Hate Niranjan Raya, Jin Jeevan Keh Bandhi Jhulaya.
Tatis Koti Devta Nahin, Aur Anek Bataun Kahin.
Brahma Vishnu Mahesh Ne Tahiya,
Shashtra Ved Puran Na Kahiya.
Tab Sab Rhe Purush Ke Mahin,
Jyon Bat Vriksh Madhya Reh Chhahin.
Dharama Das, I am talking about that time when there
was no earth and sky, when there were no Kurm,Sesh,
Varaha, Gauri, Ganesh,etc even Niranjan along with thirty


38 Sahib Bandgi
three crore Deities. There was no Brahma, Vishnu and
Mahesh. No Vedas, Shashtras or Purans. But he was one.
Kabir Sahib says that initially Param Purush was un
manifest. He didn't had any relations. He was never
manifested and never will he be destroyed.
A thing which has been formed is destined to be
destroyed. But the Param Purush who has never been born,
how could he wither away? Sahib says to Dharamdas that
the Sakar, Nirakar worlds were formed later on. Even the
four Vedas doesn't know the things related to Param
Purush, they only know till Nirakar, Kal Purush only.
While talking about the formation of earth, sky, universe,
trinity and Niranjan, Sahib says firstly Param Purush
wished and uttered a word which created a binding white
light and illuminated the infinity. It wasn't like this worldly
light, it was so wonderful that even a speck can put even
crores of Suns to shame. When that light spread to infinity
then Param Purush himself pervade it. That light got
awakened (Chetan), just like body awakens with the arrival
of Soul in it.
Before coming into light Param Purush had no identity
and veiled but after the Manifestation he was called Satya
Purush and the magnificent light which was Satya Purush
himself came to known as Amar lok.
Even then, Satya Purush was alone. He splashed his
own appearance, which resulted into innumerable Sparks.
Similar to the way when the water is splashed in the sea, it
scatters, the light also scattered. But just like the droplets
gets blend in the sea, the particles also came back to the
light. The astonishing fact was that when those Sparks
came into light they were not blended in it, instead they got
individual awareness of existence, because Satya Purush
wished they shall have separate existence... They were
called Souls-Hansa who resided in that light.
It was amazing to see all the Hansas residing in the
light. Because droplets of Sea-water does not have an


Changing the world spiritually 39
individual existence. All the beings began to roam in the
light just like a fish in the water. Param Purush began to
love those Souls. It passed a long time and all the Souls
were full of Eternal Bliss.
Sada Anand Hot Hai Va Ghar, Kabhu Na Hot Udasa.
In the Amar lok, Soul has the light of 16 Suns and the
light of a single cell of Param Purush can put to shame the
light of crores of Suns and Moons. It can be imagined, that
if one a minute part is like that, then how would Param
Purush himself be like.
Then Param Purush created his Sons with Words. Just
when Param Purush uttered the second Word, Kurm was
formed. Similarly, 'Gyan' got created from third word and
'Vivek' formed by the fourth word.
Param Purush thought that everything is being formed
by my words then why don't I make one like myself.
Hence, Param Purush wished fiercely for another Param
Purush, He did with little hesitation, thus forming
Niranjan- Mind. To know whether Niranjan is like him or
not, Param Purush enters Niranjan. In that moment he
doubted knowing that body is not his. He came out of that
body and got into his body. Then, Param Purush uttered the
sixth word which resulted in the birth of 'Sehaj'. With the
seventh word it was 'Santosh', with eight 'Chetna' with
ninth 'Anand', with tenth 'Kshma (forgiveness)',eleventh
formed 'Nishkam', twelfth formed 'Jalrangi', thirteenth
formed 'Achint', fourteenth formed 'Prem', fifteenth formed
'Deen Dhayal' as sixteenth for 'Dhairya'. To increase the
glory of Amar lok, Param Purush created his word-
offspring who began residing in the Amar lok.
All were born of word-offspring of Param Purush who
were created by his wish but Souls wasn't formed with
hiswish. Soul is part of Param Purush. Kabir Sahib says;
Jeevra Ansh Purush Ka Ahi, Adi Ant Kou Janat Nahin.
A long time passed by residing in the Amar lok. After
that, fifth son 'Niranjan' began contemplating-Tapas. He


40 Sahib Bandgi
did that for 70 Yugas by concentrating on Param Purush.
This made Param Purush happy and he asked Niranjan the
reason for the contemplation. Then, Niranjan asked for a
space for himself which was given to him in the form of
Mansarovar. Mansarovar is an island in Amar lok.
Niranjan felt exited in his new place and ,after some time
once again he began contemplation of Param Purush. Then,
Param Purush again asked the reason for the hard
contemplation of more 70 yugas.
Niranjan said-
Itna Thanv Na Mohi Suhai, Ab Mohi Baksi Dehhu Thukrai.
Kai Mohi Dehu Lok Adhikara, Kai Mohi Dehu Desh Ik Nyara.
Niranjan said-"I am not happy with this. Therefore,
either grant me power over Amar lok or give me another
World where I can exercise my full control and where I can
operate independently." Where I can rule without any one's
interference.
Param Purush then answered to Niranjan's wish by
saying that your elder brother has the seed of five tatva.
You should go and pray to him receive those five elements.
After that go to Shunya (Void Space) to create three loks. I
bless you with a reign of 17 chaukdi asankhya yugas.
Niranjan went to Kurm but instead of asking him, he
forcibly took the seed of five elements and three heads
(Gunas) just like blood from the body taken forcefully.
Kuram ji was calm, he thought of Niranjan as devil. Kurm
ji then called for Param Purush, he asked him that what
type of demon you have sent here, and he used force on
me. Param Purush told him to calm down considering he is
his younger brother asked kurm Ji to forgive Niranjan and
began contemplation about the actions of Niranjan.
After taking the seeds of five elements Niranjan created
the five tatva which are water, fire, air, earth and sky
(Ether). Just like potter makes things from soil similarly,
Niranjan created 49 crores yojana Earth, Sun, Moon, and
Stars, Seven-UnderWorlds, Seven-Worlds and Seven Skys,


Changing the world spiritually 41
with the help of these five elements. He remained in Void
Space-Sunya for long. After some time Niranjan found that
the world with no beings a bit baren. Hence, he once again
began to pray to Param Purush for 64 yugas. Then, Param
Purush asked him what does he want?
Niranjan- Deejai Khet Beej Nij Sara.
Niranjan said-"I have created the three worlds but there
are no beings on whom I should rule. So, please give me
some of the hansas-Souls so that I can have free reign over
them."
Param Purush then created a female (Adhya-Shakti)
who had eight arms. She asked about the purpose of her
existence. Param Purush gave her innumerable Souls and
told her to go to Mansarovar, where Niranjan had created
the three loks in shunya. You should go to him with these
Souls and create a true world with him in shunya. They
were not permitted to put the Souls in yonis, meaning
Souls should not be embodied physically. They were
supposed to exist the same way as they were residing in
Amar lok. It was not ment to be with Rudhra, flesh eaters.
Here, the Souls got separated from Sahib. Then,
Niranjan forced Adhya-shakti to stay with him and after
disobeying Satya Purush, he began hurting the beings as he
shifted from a world of truth to a world of perishable
bodies. He robed the souls of their bliss and began to
trouble them Sahib says-
Basuri Sukh Na Rraini Sukh, Na Supinai Mahin.
Kabir Bichhuda Sahib Su, Na Sukh Dhoop Na Chhahin.
and- Chakvi Bichhudi Raini Ki, Aayi Mili Parbhati.
Je Jan Bichhude Sahib Su, Te Din Mile Na Rati.
Sahib says that chakvi- Bird get separated from her
beloved at night but gets reunited in the morning means
she is in pain for a short span of time but Souls after being
sepatrated from Sahib and are not able to reach him, they
are suffering constantly.


42 Sahib Bandgi
After a number of evil deeds Satya Purush expelled
Niranjan from Mansarovar and cursed him to consume one
lakh beings every day. Firstly, he thought about finishing
Niranjan but he had already given 'shabad' of reign of 17
chaukdi asankhya yug to him so, he did not negate his own
word.
When Niranjan was consuming the beings from the
burning rocks, hurting them. Then all the beings cried out
for the Satya Purush in distress. They pleaded that if there
is a Supreme power then it must save us, as we can't stand
any more of this torture inflicted by Niranjan.
Now Niranjan couldn't be finished because he was
given boon, but the pleas of the beings couldn't be
overlooked. Sahib contemplated and churning himself like
taking ghee out of Curd, produced from himself Satya -
kabir and he was told to save the beings which were
tortured in other realm by Niranjan.
Once kabir Sahib cut down the Niranjan's head but after
remembering the 'Boon' of Satya Purush he conjured him
with the help of Surti.
Kabir Sahib sometimes descends as Satguru in this
world and takes the beings with different method of Satya
Bhakti to Amar lok. As the people are worshiping Kal
Purush, hence it is a difficult deed to sway them from their
path which leads to the animosity. So the beings which are
attained germination of the Satya Purush get attract to the
Sahibs teachings just like a magnet gets attracted to iron.
However those who are Part of Kal Purush are not affected
by those teachings. Even after being manipulated by the
Kal Purush, the beings are unable to get rid of the web
caused by Kal and they are unable to reconcile with Sahib.
Everyone is entangled in this sleep. Thus, Sahib warns,
Kabir Sokar Kya Kare, Uth Aur Uthkar Jag.
Jinke Sang Se Bichhda, Va Hi Ke Sang Laag.
He is saying that devote yourself to the Sahib from
whom you have separated. Furthermore,


Changing the world spiritually 43
Tumko Bisar Gai Sudh Ghar Ki, Mahima Apan Jatai Ho.
Nirankar Nirgun Hai Mahiya, Tumko Nach Nachai Ho.
Charam Drishti Da Kulfa Deke, Chaurasi Bharmai Ho.
He says that you have forgotten about your true home,
you are not aware of your glory and you are not even
aware of your power. The thing which is Nirgun, Nirakar is
Maya which is making you dance on her fingertips. You
have been on illusion into the eighty-four Dhaams. (Life
Forms)He says-
Char Ved Hain Jaki Swansa, Brahma Astuti Gai Ho.
So Kathi Brahma Jagat Bhulaye, Tehi Marg Sab Jai Ho.
Four vedas have been created from the breath of
Nirgunand its praise has been sung by Brahma ji. This has
confused the beings and they are walking on the path
leading to the Nirgun Parmatma.
..So Sahib has talked about beloved Param Purush. He
is different from Sagun-Niirgun. The world is calling the
Paramatma a Nirakaar. Sahib is saying-
Bechune Jag Ranchiya, Sahib Noor Ninaar.
Akhir Kere Waqt Ko, Kiska Kare Didaar.
The world is absorbed in the Nirakar. If he is a Nirakar
then whom would you see at the end. True Sahib is in the
form of Soundless Sound and light. It is a natural light not
a materalistic one (No Heat, but Blissful).
The world says that he gets incarnated in this world but
Sahib says-
Dashrath Kul Autar Nahi Aaya. Nahin Lanka Ke Rav Sataya.
Prithvi Raman Dhaman Nahin Kariya.Paithi Patal Na Bali
Chhaliya.
...Ee Sab Kaam Sahib Ke Nahin. Jhooth Kahe Sansara.
These are the deeds of Niranjan not of Sahib. He
doesn't cheat and nor he hurt anybody.
Hai Dayal Droh Na Vake, Kahu Kaun Ko Mara.
Furthermore,
Janam Maran Se Rahit Hai, Mera Sahib Soye.
Balihari Us Peev Ki, Jin Sirja Sab Koye.
Sahib tells Dharamdas about the subject of Param Purush.


44 Sahib Bandgi
Anant Koti Brahmand Rach, Sab Se Rahe Nyar.
Jind Khe Dharamdas Son, Taka Karo Vichaar.
He is saying who is most amiable after creating the
number of universes, dwell on him.
Des Hamar Nyar Thun Pur Te.Ahipur Narpur Aru Surpur Se.
Tahan Nahin Yam Ka Pravesa. Adi Purush Ka Hai Veh Desha.
Satyalok Tehi Des Suhela. Satyanam Gai Kije Mela.
Adbhut Jyoti Purush Ki Kaya. Hansan Shobha Adhik Suhaya.
Ek Hans Jas Shodash Bhana. Agra Vasna Hans Aghana.
Satyapurush Ki Aisi Bata .Kotik Shashi Ik Rom Lajata.
Ek Ro Ki Shoba Aisi.Aur Badab Ki Baarnaun Kaisi.
Anginat Chanda Jagat Mein, Anginat Darsen Soor.
Aise Jhalken Noor Sab, Noor Noor Bharpoor.
Koti Chand Ki Sheetlta, Koti Surya Ka Tej.
Aisi Shobha Lok Ki, Satya Purush Ki Sej.
It is said that every bit of Param Purush is so much that
it can even put crores of Suns and Moons to shame. Then
how could the glory of his body could be explained.
Shabad Akhand Hot Din Rati.
Na Koi Pooja Na Koi Paati. Aisi Hakikat Ko Maine Jana.
Aras Kuras Noor Daras, Tej Punj Dekha.
Koti Bhanu Sanch Manu, Rom Rom Dekha.-Garibdas ji.
Garibdas ji says that you must believe me when I say
that I have seen every bit of Param Purush's body illumined
with the light of crore suns.
This description is only by examination. Param Purush
is beloved of Soul. Sahib says-
Aave Na Jaave Mare Nahin Janme, Soi Nij Peev Hamara Ho.
Na Koi Janni Na Janmo, Na Koi Sirjanhara Ho.
Sadh Na Sidh Mni Na Tapsi, Na Koi Karat Achara Ho.
Na Shat Darshan Char Varan Mein, Na Ashram Vyabhara Ho.
Na Trideva Soham Shakti, Nirakar Se Para Ho.
Shabad Ateet Achal Avinashi, Kshar Akshar Se Nyara Ho.
Jyoti Swaroop Niranjan Nahin, Na Om Hankara Ho.
Dharni Na Gagan Pawan Na Pani,Na Ravi Chand Na Tara Ho
Hai Pragat Par Deesat Nahin, Satguru Sain Sahara Ho.
Kahain Kabir Sab Ghat Mein Sahib, Parkho Parkhanhari Ho.


Changing the world spiritually 45
Pay close attention to these words. It is being said that
the one who is our true beloved is beyond birth and death,
does not visit the world, and means he is not born out of a
mother's womb as an Avatar. He does not have parents or
any one shown his parents. He is not a Sant or Siddh or
Sadhu, or Tapasvi nor is he attuned to this materialistic
world. None of them, he is above the even Sathdharsan
(Jogi, Jangam, Jukiya, Tapsi, Vairagi, Brahman and
Sanyasi). He is beyond the four Varna (the Brahmin, the
Kshatriya, the Vaisya and the Sudra.). He is above the four
Ashrams (Brahmacharya, Grihastha, Vanaprastha and
Sanyas). He is neither young nor a child. Age has no effect
on him. He is not one of the trinity Gods nor is he its
Soham. He is not Energy even. He is above Nirakaar
himself. He is in the form of Soundless Sound,
indestructible. He is dearer then Maya and Brahm. He is
neither Aum nor light formed Niranjan. He is not any of
the tatvas like Earth, Sky, Fire, Air and Water, also he is
higher from Sun, Moon and Stars. Only a Satguru's Sabdh
(Soundless Sound) can give his evidence. Some rare seeker
can delve in his depths.
These words contain the secret of a lifetime. When one
talk about a true Guru they say that they already have one
Guru, if we go to another one then wouldn't it be like
leaving one's husband for another. The thing to be realised
here is that whether you are worshiping your own husband
(Param Purush Sahib) or the one who is not yours. Sahib
has sets aside the Trinity, Munis, Nirakaar, Brahma, God,
Aum, Hari, Hara or Sagun devotion Lettered Sound and
Nirgun Bhakti- Dhune Atmic Sabdh All this are under Kal
Purush, Sahib Kabir has reveild the one who is higher then
Kal. None them could be considered as being's own
husband. This means that the world is not devoted to the
real husband, it is being led by the Guru to worship an
unreal husband, it is not ready to disentangle from that. It
is not even aware of the true identity of one's own husband.


46 Sahib Bandgi
This is the main fault of forgetfulness. They do not want
toleave that husband and go to another, this is a peculiar
stand. But the truth is they are unable to recognize their
husband. Dadu dyal ji says-
Purush Hamara Ek Hai, Hum Nari Bahu Ang.
No one is able to identify Param Purush in the form of a
real husband. Then, Sahib says-
Jab Tak Guru Mile Nahin Sancha,
Tab Tak Guru Karo Das Pancha.
Because only a complete Satguru could take us to the
real world and help us meet our true beloved. Soul is a part
of Param Purush, he is the true Sahib. Kal Niranjan has
bound all the Souls. He is the guilty, for all the Souls along
with Param Purush. That is why Param Purush had exiled
him from his world Amar lok. Now Niranjan doesn't let
Souls to go out of his word Amar lok and hurt them. The
Mahatmas are giving the Naam of Niranjan to the beings.
The stamp is of Sahib but the Naam is of jyoti Niranjan,
Onkar, Rrankar, Soham or the many names of trinity or
any one from 52 letters. No one is familiar with the true
Naam of Param Purush. This is a hidden thing, which is
only in the possession of Sants because the one who
reached Amar lok, can only get it.
Jo Pahuncha Janega Vohi, Kehan Sunan Se Nyara Hai.
That Naam could not be heard or spoken. But today the
Mahatmas are giving Naam of 52 Alphbets. Every Naam
belong to Niranjan. Sahib says-
Man Hi Niranjan, Man Hi Onkar, Man Hi Hai Kartara.
Onkar and Niranjan both are the names of Mind. All are
giving only this Naams. No one wants to leave that Naam
nor that Mahatma which is related with Niranjan. Some
people say that going for another Guru is a sin. This is just
a network which blinds and entangle the people. Sahib
says-
Jab Tak Guru Mile Nahin Sancha, Tab Tak Karo Das Pancha.


Changing the world spiritually 47
He is saying that you can take 5 - 10 Gurus till you get a
true Guru. You will not be committing sin by doing that.
Some argue that how can you leave afather and goto
another, this is correct only when you get a True Guru who
gives the devotion to Param Purush. Therefore do not leave
your real parents.
Saar Naam Chhadi Ke, Karay Aan Ki Aas.
Te Nar Narkay Jahinge, Satya Bhashay Raidas.
Those who wish for another despite having a true Guru
will go to hell.
The question here arises that the person leaving the true
Paramatma, worshipping Kal Purush and takes to the feet
of a Guru who worships Kal Purush, is he not left the
Param Purush and being with others? He is serving at the
feet of his father's adversary. Just like our body has formed
by our parents, they have given us birth, they deserve to be
respected and service of their children. Those who keep
away from their duties and listen to them they are at fault
here. Similar is the importance of services of a true Guru.
He gives something to Soul and takes it away to its true
father, true beloved (Sahib). Therefore, he is known to be
far greater than parents and Paramatma. His service is the
service of Param Purush. Therefore to serve Param Purush
one should seek the holy feet of a real Satguru and Serve
him.
Now those who are worshiping Kal Purush are they not
by default hurt Param Purush by not serving him?
However, those who engage Jivas of Param Purush in
devotion of Kal Purush and entangle them more and more
in that are realy a major offender of Param Purush. The
world is not enlightened about the Param Purush but the
one who is aware of all the differences and having the
information about Param Purush our true father and still
leave a Guru and go to another, does not leave a false Guru
and seek true Guru, not leaving the one who gives the
devotion of Kal Purush and seek the one who gives the


48 Sahib Bandgi
devotion of Param Purush, this is their stand. Where is the
merit in their stand? Wasn't they an offender of Param
Purush.
Like if a child is stolen from its parents at the early age
and he begans to think of the abdutor as his father then it's
not his fault. He just never knew his parents. But the
abductor would only straighten his own deeds selfishly
even by hurting the child. This will create the friction in
child's heart about his own father is hurting him. Similarly,
the ones who suffer in this world sometime come to think
that how God could hurt them like that, however if he does
not find one who can help him correctly, then he will be
unable to understand it. If an evil agent of abductor
misguides the child by telling him that the Abductor is his
real father then the child will deluded by taking the
troublesome theif as his father. Just like that there are
persons in this world who are confusing the beings and
entangling them in the devotion to the Kal Purush. If a Sant
or his servent tell the truth, pointout to them the true parent
and make them understand about their true parent even
then they say that how can I go to another parents by
leaving my present one, then what can be said?.
Think about your action and the truth of it. What a
opposite direction your following. You are not devoted to
that Param Purush but to whom you are not suppose to, but
to that Kal Purush you are devoted.
Aise Jag Jeev Gyan Chalai, Dharamdas Tohi Katha Sunai.
Yahi Jagat Ki Ulti Riti, Naam Na Jane Kaal Son Preeti.
Sahib says, Dharamdas, the beings of this world flows
with the downstream, they don't know true Naam, they
love Kal Purush, worship him and consider him to be true
Sahib. First they don't agree, do not enquire, and take to
fight, Kabir Sahib says-
Premi Khojat Main Phirun, Premi Mila Na Koye.
Jaso Kahiye Bhed Ko, So Phir Bairi Hoye.

He says that he is searching for the beloved of that
Sahib but he is unable to find a true devotee. If they can
understand it it-self is a big leap. However no one
understands it that easily. They are not ready to accept.
Sahib says-
Kaal Ka Jeev Mane Nahin, Main Kotin Khun Samjhaye.
Main Khaanchat Hun Satlok Ko, Yeh Bandha Jampur Jaye.
The Jivi who is devoted to Kal Purush will not even
believe it. Sahib says that I want to take Jivi to Satlok by
giving them to the secret of Param Purush. But they are not
accepting and instead want to go to Yampur-City of death.

SOUL IN BONDAGE
Eeshwar Ansh Jeev Avinashi, Chetan, Amal, Sehaj, Sukhrasi.
This soul is a part of the Supreme Lord. It is Immortal
(Avinaashi), spiritually active (Chetan), pure and free of vices
(Amal). It is free from deceit and is spiritually simple (Sehaj).
Besides, it is full of joy, happiness and bliss (Sukhrasi).
So Maya Bas Bhayo Gosain, Bandhyo Keet Market Ki Nayi.
Such a soul is tied like a parrot, like a monkey.There are
three requirements for tying. First - One who ties,
Second - One who is tied and The third - The means.
Why did he catch such Atma? A man can hold something.
Sometime he catches Rat, sometimes Fish. Why does he catch?
Because rat is destructive. Fish is a food for some, so it is
caught. Some keep Cow. They keep it tied because they want
Milk. The Cow may want to leave but they may not let her
leave. The keepers did not give birth to Cow. They tied her with
rope. If it runs away they search and find, bring it back, tie it up.
Nobody wants to give up their control over Bull. Bull's
effort does not work, it cannot release itself. It may get beaten.
But it is always tied by a rope. Similarly, Soul is bound by Mind
for a reason, why? They get lot of work done from Cattle.
Bahu Bandhan Te Bandhiya, Ek Behaara Jeev,
Jeev Bechara Kya Kare, Jo Na Churahiyen Peev.
Our soul has many bondages. Such an intelligent man, who is
the supreme of all creations, is unable to understand his
bondages. What is this mystery? What is the secret?


50 Sahib Bandgi

5. Naam Initiation, Before and After.

To cross this worldly ocen of birth and death, you need
the power of Naam, this fact has been accepted by the
mankind. The followers have understood the glory of
Naam. In Ramcharitmanas, Goswami ji says-
Ram Ek Tapas Tiye Tari, Naam Koti Khal Kumati Ubari.
He says that Ram ji had released Ahilya, wife of tapsvi
Gowtham rishi, but the power of Satya Naam liberated
crores of sinners.Therefore-
Brahm Ram Tein Namu Bad, Bar Dayak Bardani.
Ramcharit Sat Koti Mahan, Liye Mahes Jiyan Jani.
It is said that Naam is greater than both Sagun Ram and
Nirgun Brahm.While glorifying Naam Tulsidas has said-
Kahaun Kahan Lagi Naam Badai,
Ram Na Sakhin Naam Gun Gai.
Naam has established an unndisputed place, Naam is
the king. It is beyond the Speach and listening. This
blissful Naam is beyond Sagun and Nirgun Bhakti. Sahib
says- Mool Naam Nij Sar Hai, Sab Saran Ke Sar.
Jo Koi Pave Naam Ko, Soi Hans Hamar.
He says this Naam is summary of everything. Whoever
gets this Naam becomes our Hansa, celestial Swan. Sahib
says- Mool Naam Nij Sar Hai, Kahi Pukar Pukar.
Jo Pave So Bachai, Nahin To Kaal Pasar.
He says that Naam is summary of everything, I am
telling you this again and again. Those who receive Naam
only from Satguru can be saved from Kaal, as this whole
world is in the network of Kaal.
Kaal Bali Tihun Lok Mein, Jeev Sheev Ke Nath.
Mool Naam Jo Pavai, So Chale Hamare Sath.
The web of Kaal is quite strong in the three loks. He is
the master of all beings and Gods. However, one with the
Satya Naam get rid of it and goes back with us to our
country- Amarlok.
Dharamdas Main Satyahi Bhakha,
Tumse Goye Kachhu Nahin Rakha.


Changing the world spiritually 51
Chaudah Arab Gyan Main Bhakha, Mool Naam Gupt Kari Rakha.
Mool Naam Hai Sabke Bheda, Pave Hansa Hoye Akheda.
Gupt Pragat Hum Tumse Bhakha,
Pind Brahmand Ke Upar Rakha.
It says that I have always spoken truth of Truth to you,
nothing is hidden. You have been told the saying of 14
Arab Sants but the Naam has been kept hidden. The Hansa,
who gets the Naam doesn't suffer anymore. I have instilled
and reveiled that secret Naam in you and lifted you out of
this universal body.
Mool Naam Pragat Nahin Kariye, Yahi Naam Ko Gupthin Thariye.
Mool Naam So Jeev Ubara, Aur Naam Pragat Sansara.
Mool Naam Jake Ghat Aaven, So Hansa Satya Lok Sindhave.
Mool Naam Ki Pave Dori, Toote Ghat Athasi Karori.
Yugan Yugan Leyi Avtara, Mool Naam So Hansa Ubara.
Mool Naam Gupt Tum Rakho, Sat Naam Pragat Tum Bhakho.
Koti Karm Hans Ke Hoi, Mool Naam So Daro Dhoi.
Neer Pawan Ka Bhed Apara, Mool Naam Inhun Te Nyara.
Mool Naam Binu Mukti Na Hoi, Lakh Gyan Kathe So Ki.
Akah Naam Jeev Ke Sara, Pave Hansa Koi Bhavpara.
Sahib says that this Naam is not to be unveiled, it needs
to remain hidden. This hidden Naam will release the Souls
from worldly life. Those who will receive this Naam will
have final destination as Satya lok. While receiving mool
Naam all network of the Kalpurush will be severed. I arrive
in this world in different Yugas and with the help of Naam
I take away Swans-Souls to Satya lok. No matter how
much Karma and Knowledge is acquired by a person he
can't free himself without the help of Mool Naam. This
Naam cannot be spoken. The one who gets this Naam will
cross this worldly ocean of birth and death. What does this
Naam do? Where does it come from? Before enquiring
these let us see what you were before Naam.


52 Sahib Bandgi
WHAT YOU WERE BEFORE NAAM INITIATION

Now, you are drowned in the world of Mind. Your
Mind and Soul has combines just like water and milk.
That's why you can't witness the bane of soul. Mind has
overpowered Soul. Its result is that you have no knowledge
of bane and boon. You are working as per dictates of your
Mind. Whether you like it or not you’re following Mind.
Sometimes the Mind is good, sometimes it’s bad. The
inspiration of both evil and good deeds is of Mind. This is
the reason why you are not able to understand the clever
working of Mind. This Mind is making you do vicious
things like cheating, treachery and things like that.
At present the Surti of a common man is afflicted.
When a diamond is in the soil it isn't luminous but when it
is cleaned then it begins to reflect light. Its brilliance is
never lost, it's just hindered. Similarly, Surti is complete by
itself. It doesn't increase or decrease. Its light, nature,
power can't diminish. Therefore, it is not in the need of
other support. It has been polluted by Mind and Maya due
to which its luminosity has been concealed and nature
hidden.
Some people say that devotion gives strength to the
Soul. No it's not like that. If the Soul needs power from
another source then that would mean that the other thing is
stronger than the Soul. But no, there is nothing which is
greater than Soul. Soul is the essence of Supreme lord
himself. It doesn't need any outside material.
Then why do we need to worship? Why are we to
meditate? Let us see, Devotion and concentration won't
give power to Soul but they will clear away the dirt of
Mind and Maya which has veiled it and Soul will begin to
experience itself. When Soul begins to know itself then it
will not accept the direction of Mind anymore.
At present, Soul is working on the directions of the
Mind. Whatever Mind will say that will be done by the


Changing the world spiritually 53
Soul. All the evil deeds being done by human, does Soul
wants to do them? No, Mind is the inspiration of all these
evil deeds. Soul is unable to realise itself. Mind
overpowers Soul 24 hours a day and wouldn't let the Soul
think. Under the control of Mind, Soul is thinking itself as
the human body and has set itself to complete the desires of
Mind. This body is very complex. There reside demons
like Lust, Anger, Desires, Greed, and Pride etc. which are
dragging Soul to the gates of hell. Soul has become
helpless.
Jeev Pada Bahu Loot Mein, Nahin Kachhu Len Na Den.
Firstly, does the present form of devotion have any
mistake? If there is, then why there is no refinement. Is
there is a flaw in the present state of devotion. This is a
very serious issue. Common People give their suggestions
on the corruption through radio, and TV. Therefore if the
society is drowned in to evilness then the field of the
devotion shall be reviewed. Is the current form of devotion
correct? If there is a fault, then where is it? There is a
strong increase in the presence of Sin, Corruption and
Cruelty etc.
A Journalist asked me very pertinent questions that do
you think that humen are following devotion considering
the atmosphere of devotion all around? I replied no. I have
the perception that the distance between the human and
devotion is the widest ever. If you take a look at the history
you will find that human have moved far away from
devotion today. If there had been devotion then why are
there violence, injustice, and corruption etc.? People are
dragged towards devotion these days. Like the
businessmen try to attract the customers to themselves, like
a political party draws people, similar is the case with
people are being dragged in the web of devotions by the
religious dogmas and belief systems. This is not a matter of
one institution. There is now competition between the
Religions for the number of followers. No one is free.


54 Sahib Bandgi
Everyone has a stamp of a community/sect over them.
What does the Religions preachers want now, do they seek
salvation for their followers. If the humen are in pure
devotion then there should not be any crime in this world.
Bhakti Swantatar Sakal Gun Khani, Binu Satsang Na Pawat Prani.
Devotion is the creator of good Virtues. Love,
compassion, forgiveness, wisdom etc. they are the features
of the devotion. Whenever a human worship these features
will manifest in him. However at present no one can see
true love between people. There is no evidence of kinsman
ship. There is no proof of manifestation of Devotion. What
has happened to devotion?
There are more diseases in the society today. A survey
was taken to know its reasons. It was concluded that
atmosphere is contaminated. The food we are consuming is
contaminated with chemicals and urea etc. Everything is
adulterated. Then because of pollution the water and air are
also impure.
Diseases are increasing in numbers due to pollution in
environment, deficiencies in standards of food, in living
and compounded by tension and depression. Depression or
stress is the root of all problems. It affects heart, lungs and
brain. Stress can cause the heart to fail and brain related
diseases can accrue. When our desires remain unfulfilled,
stress rises.
What is the reason for the rise of Sins in the Society
today? There must be someone responsible right? If there
is an accident, the person responsible is found and also the
reason for the accident is found. Who is at fault is also
considered. Then the person at fault is punished. Works are
done to prevent further accidents in the future.
Similarly the root of Sin should also be found. If there
is evil in the Society, then the main reason for this is the
Religions. If the human are in treachery then the
responsible one is not government but it is the Religion.
See that initially people were hesitant in committing Sins


Changing the world spiritually 55
as the preachers easier taught them not to commit sins.
They also did not commit treachery. Even if there was,
their numbers was less.
Humen are unable to understand the concept of bane
and boon. The system of devotion has failed. Therefore it
needs to search for the faults. Brothers are at each other's
throat. If someone has a pure character then he is seen as
meak. The one who is not taking alcohol is seen as stupid.
The one who is not into scandal is seen as backward and
the one who is not into violence is seen as a coward. Mind
is using his five hands of lust, anger, greed, desire and
pride and bending everyone as it suits to him. Without
Naam everyone is being pressed in to the web of Mind and
Maya. This whole world is of Mind. Mind is the king of
this world that's why there is only his reign.
The one who is in control is the King and his orders are
carried out. Does Kal Purush has reign over world? If we
give it a thought then we will observe it to be true. The
party which is a ruling party, it’s the one giving the orders.
There are different ministers, like for electricity and
defense. They all are ruling. Does Mind is also ruling us
similarly. On all of us there is a control, which is flows
downwards.
The government is in control of schools. If it decides it
can opens the school at 7 or at 8. Similarly, there is the
reign of Niranjan over this world. How is it controlling?
'Manhin Niranjan Sabpar Chhaye'.
His power is that his every order should be carried out.
At least we can know how it Works? He can do anything.
How? Just as chief minister has complete control over a
state. How does the reign of the Mind is carried out? It
gives message through the brain. All the ministers are
under the chief minister. Similarly, Mind also has
ministers. Mind tells you to slap someone. How does this
request enforced? Mind gives this command to
Intelligence. What does Intellect mean? Intellect is also a


56 Sahib Bandgi
part of Mind. Intellect enquires as to who the one who is
abused. Intellect tells Hatred to do that task. Minister of
Anger is- Hatred. Gave the order, slap in that case. If
hatred did not arise then how could anyone slap another?
They are not at fault here. Policeman carried out their
order, they have no choice. Therefore, this is not their
wish. They were simply following the orders. They also
have S.P. The preceding Deities of senses take order from
Mind. If Mind desires to eat mango, every wish is carried
out. Mind wishes for wealth. What is it doing? He is the
boss and operating the network from behind like the Mafia.
Therefore-
Tera Bairi Koi Nahin, Tera Bairi Man.
Jeev Ke Sang Man Kal Rahai, Agyani Nar Janaat Nahin.
You want wealth. It won't come easily. Intellect told
cupidity his wants for money. It gets established. Under
one order from the government, the party supporters get
ready to do that. Intellect orders to slap then hands get
ready. This deed is accomplished. Five things are
important and all of them are Ministers. They have a full
command. Everything needs to be done, it doesn't matter
that you want to or not, because it is the order of the Mind.
When greed arise, its minister will sit in brain and
orders it to do this and that for his son. Man wishes for the
stars. Ministers give the powers to the supporters. They
have weapons which are hidden. Sahib says-
Teen Lok Mein Manhin Viraji, Tahi Na Chiharat Pandit Kaji.
Mind is the Administrator in all three loks. Whatever it
wishes, it does. If we dig deep into it, we will find that it
has a big army. Its army is quite strong too. Sahib says-
Bahu Bandhan Te Bandhiya, Ek Vichara Jeev.
Just like secretaries, tehsildars, commissioner, police
stations and constables and there are police men in the
market to control an area. Similarly Mind has a complete
control over the three loks. That is his power. Even lust,
anger, desires and greed, etc. belong to this.


Changing the world spiritually 57
Pratham Pravarti Man Ko, Mahamoh Ahankar.
Dooji Pravarti Upjo, Kaam Prabal Jag Mein.
These vices are inside everyone. Lust, Anger, Desires,
Pride, Arrogance etc. are inside everyone. There is vanity
related to beauty, even with education pride develops.
They have their families too.
Attachment to wife is affection. It resides within
everyone. You will find everything dear to you. A
Mahatma doesn't find anything dear to himself. He knows
his true self. Then its son is Pride. Its base is
possessiveness Me and Mine. This is not soul. This is an
internal web.
Chashm Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashe Ho Rahe.
Dil Sata Kya Kya Hain, Dil Satane Ke Liye.
If we watch T.V, then we see that mahatmas today are
either appearing with their long hairs or beard or dot-tilak.
Everyone’s Identity is recognized by their appearances.
You recognize me by my kurta-pajama. If I were to change
into a shirt and pant then you wouldn't even recognize me
even if I wander the whole city.
I met a girl while brushing my teeth on a train journey
at night. When she saw me in the morning, she asked me
you are Sahib Ji, aren't you? I smiled giving her answer.
She was saying that she was telling her husband whole
night that you are Sahib but he wasn't agreeing with me. I
was trying to identify you. I recognized by the way you
walk. She was a Naami yet she was unable to recognize
me.
..Similarly, lust (Manmata) also has a family. His wife
is Rati. What is Rati? Rati is the process of intercourse. She
is the wife of lust. They attack as a duo. They are the type
of enemies who cannot be to be seen but their attack is still
strong. Greed is their son. Where they do not exist there is
no intercourse. Then comes obsession. She is the daughter
in law of lust. If there is a feud, then the whole family will


58 Sahib Bandgi
fight with them, they will unite. This is the way of their
feud. A Mahapurush is the one who recognises all of them.
'Prabal Avidya Ka Parivara.'
In Ramayana, Goswami ji says- In Sab Mil Jeevhi Ghera.
They can't be seen. They have surrounded the Soul. It is
bound and thus the victim. We are unable to understand
them. The enemy is a genius here.
Then there is anger. His wife is violence. When we are
angry, we want to hit and beat something. When there is
violence we feel satisfied. It says that killing gives it a
satisfaction. This is the story of everyone. It tells that you
attend peace if you take revenge against them. What type
of satisfaction is that which we are gaining by hitting or
abusing someone? Human are unable to understand the full
mechanism of his own body. They are unable to
understand its system.
There was a Psychiatrist; with one question he got
puzzled. I asked him, what is Mind? Where does it reside?
When the talk was completed, he said oh Maharaja!
Whatever you are saying, is not covered under any subjects
of syllabus. I keep a watch on the driver. If I observe them
looking at girl on the road, I give a hit. It has become a
habit. If they unnecessarily sound their own, I caution the
driver and slap sometime. If this is the behavior while on a
car drive with me.
Rahiman Laak Bhali Karo, Auoguni Agun Na Jay||
All these are powerful. The one who codified Vedas, Ved
Vyasji, cried out for his Son, out of attachment. When he was
reminded, he came to his senses.
Son of Anger is nondiscrimination, meaning not to enquire,
when Anger arises, discrimination departs. It suppresses Atmic
nature within. Its daughter-in law is forgetfulness, they say that
they forgot. There is a family of greed, Hatred is his wife. Greed
makes human commit sinful deeds. Falsehood is the Daughter –
in- law of Greed, Sin is the Son
As Asur Ghat Mein Base, Kaise Rahe Kushal.


Changing the world spiritually 59
No one is giving any thought to this. The network of
the Mind is powerful. Even great people are unable to
understand it. Sahib says-
Sayyad Ke Kabu Mein Hain Sab Jeev Vichare.
All the beings are in the hands of devil powers. We are
unable to get free. We are following their orders
subconsciously. These orders reflect in our body. This can
be found by inquiry in to its working. Who is it? Mind.
Sahib says-
Manhin Aahe Kaal Karala, Jeev Nachaye Kare Behala.
This means that there is a force inside us which is ever
being followed by the Soul. Let's see what are the losses
here? There is merit in what Kabir Sahib said that we are
under a powerful, cruel, and violent force. For instance,
every wish of mind is carried out. Whatever it wishes, is
being done. Mind has a great army. It has great power.
Mind just sends a message. Then all the Senses follow that
order. Mind has four forms-Thought-Munn, Intellect-
Buddhi, Memory-Chitt and Ego-Ahankar. These are the
four forms of the mind. When intellect orders to slap
someone then hands, body and soul all of them abide by
that wish. Mind has ministers-lust, anger, desire, greed,
pride and ego. They have a huge army. Just as a regiment
is controlled and ordered, similar is the reign of mind. The
message from the top-order is followed till the last one.
The orders of the Mind are carried out by everyone. For
instance, intelligence orders us to be distasteful to a person.
Then it gives the command. When we hit someone after the
command the hand begin their work. Then how does it
work? Violence accompanies Anger. Violence is the wife
of anger. Indiscrimination is his son and abomination is his
daughter in law. This family is very dangerous. Violence
the queen says beat him it, beating gives me pleasure. The
pleasure is so much that there is no sanity left. Haste is his
son. When we hit someone, we feel that we will be only at
peace after we hit that person. In anger we abuse verbally


60 Sahib Bandgi
to attain peace. That is to feel satisfaction. What type of
satisfaction is that which you get by hitting someone, by
hurting him we attain peace. This violence was the wife of
anger. When Indiscrimination arrives it doesn't let anyone
think. He urges you to continue. Then abomination arrives.
This family is very dangerous. If we see, we will find that
all of these are found within us. This means that Mind has
a huge network. Its minister is greed. When we desire for
wealth, intelligence gives the command to cupidity to get
on and it does. Ambition is its wife. It also rises. If there is
ambition then there is no peace. Its Son is sin. Their son is
also dangerous. It doesn't let anyone think. He will always
urges you toward sin. All of them are the army of Mind.
Aatmdev is obeying him fully. Similar is the kamdev.
Mind confuses the being. And when lust arrives even
intelligence becomes its associate. We only contemplate
about satisfaction of Lust. Rati is the wife of lust. It is the
process of intercourse. This family is also dangerous. They
have all surrounded the being completely.
In Sab Mil Jeevhi Ghera, Bina Parichaye Bhaya Yam Ko Chera.
Moha-Attachments
Moh Sakal Vyadhin Ko Mool, Tate Upjat Bahu Vidhi Soola.
What is attachments? When a human is in this state he
begins to do misconstrue deeds. It has a wife, a full family.
Its wife is obsession. His son is ignorance. When feeling of
attachment rise we feel that this is mine. There arise such
feeling in many instances. Mind is active here. Whichever
party is the ruling one, it has the full reign. Whatever the
highest authority makes order, it is complied. Similar is the
case of commands of Mind. A demon's army is obviously
powerful. They remain inside the humans and does their
work. They are powerful one above the other. Aatmdev is
also obeying them. Now the question arises, why is the
Soul obeying them? Are they powerful than the soul? No,
it’s because of Ignorance. Ignorance is that we regard
ourselves as Mind or intelligence. This is the working of


Changing the world spiritually 61
Mind. The weapon of the Mind is ignorance. It’s not
known, as to who is doing this? This is done by ignorance.
What or whose power is used? It is of the soul. If Aatmdev
doesn't obey them then nothing can happen. Sahib says-
Aapa Ko Aapa Hi Bandhyo.
You have been warned and awakened here. You are
bound by his power.
Jaise Swan Kanch Mandil Maa, Bharmat Bhoonki Parayo.
A Dog in a castle of glass dies barks at his own
reflection thinking that there is another Dog. But the truth
is that he takes his reflection as another Dog.
Jaise Nahar Koop Mein, Apni Pratima Dekh Parayo.
A lion roared at a well. He takes his reflection as
another lion. The sound also echoes. No one killed the
Lion. Taking the reflection to be another lion, he himself
jumped into the water. Means he was killed by the
ignorance. Similarly, Aatmdev himself is getting bound
with his own power due to ignorance. It has been
mentioned in the shashtras that soul is indestructible, it
can't be killed. Vasudev told Arjun that he had given the
lesson of Gita to Sun. Arjun enquires as how it could be?
You have born in this Yuga whereas Sun is there since a
long time. Then Vasudev replied that you and I have taken
many births before. The difference is only that you don't
remember any of them and I do.
Means soul had many bodies. They were all left behind.
Aakhir Yeh Tan Khak Milega, Kahan Firat Magruri Mein.
This body will also be left behind. This is the complete
truth. Even after that, ignorance is so much, that we still
feel that body is the truth. This is because of the
attachments. When it arrives, even Soul calls it as its own
and began committing sin out of greed. This is not the
nature of soul. At present you can't see the nature of Soul
without Naam.
When we try to know someone then there are two
factors. One is the physical structure and the one its nature.


62 Sahib Bandgi
We recognize them by their eyes, nose etc. this is in our
memory, how do they look. Secondly by nature that how is
he? We ask how he is. Why is it being asked? How is he by
work, nature, this implies to that. Then the answer comes
he is fine. He is not harming anyone, selfless therefore he
is fine. We also see the Soul. Where is Soul? We also look
towards the nature. The structure is very delicate. It’s
neither male nor female. It is not even five tatvas. Means
its neither fire nor air. It is a part of Param Purush. It's
clear. It’s neither big nor small. It is indestructible. It
doesn't increase or decrease. It’s strong and eternal. It’s
outer from is incredible. Its formation is fierce. It is beyond
the five tatvas. Wherever there are in tatvas, it is bound to
be destroyed, earth is destroyed by water, water is
destroyed by fire, fire is destroyed by air and air is
destroyed by the sky. But soul is beyond them. Now let’s
see the features of the Soul. It is Aatmdev not a demon. It
has wisdom, pure, free of anger, greed, defects, and
violence. It has Vivek and bliss. It is calm and patient.
These same features are found in the Supreme Purush.
Ramayana says-
Ishwar Ansh Jeev Avinashi, Chetan Amal Sehaj Sukhrasi.
So Maya Bas Bhayo Gussai, Bandhyo Keer Markat Ki Naai.
This soul is a part of the Supreme Purush. It is
Immortal (Avinaashi), spiritually active (Chetan), pure and
free of vices (Amal). It is free from deceit and is spiritually
simple (Sehaj). Besides, it is full of joy, happiness, and
bliss (Sukhrasi).
It is independent. It doesn't need any support. Means it
is not dependent on the outer resources. Body is dependent.
If it doesn't get water or air it will die. But Soul doesn't
face any problems. It is indestructible. This is its nature.
Soul is very calm and serene. But where is it lost? The
thing we are seeing in others is not Soul but it is the family
of Mind. Whatever is seen are not the Soul. The kind of
deeds done by the human can't be attributed to the Soul.


Changing the world spiritually 63
They have cupidity, arrogance, and abomination. Where
has the Soul gone? Is this the Soul? If it is so then it can't
be called Pure. It has been bound. We are seeing the family
of Mind and vices. Aatmdev is under a veil. Everyone is
asking us to know the Soul. The power which is confusing
the Soul is not letting the Soul understand anything about
Soul itself.
Bahu Bandhan Te Bandhiya, Ek Vichara Jeev.
Jeev Vichara Kya Kare, Jo Na Chhudave Peev.
All of them bound of the soul.
Prabal Avidya Ka Parivara.
Goswami ji says-
Jad Chetan Hai Granth Pad Gai,
Yadyapi Mithya Chhutat Kathinai.
These words are also said by sahib that soul is in a trap.
Par Lagan Ko Har Kooi Chahe,
Bin Satguru Koi Par Na Pave.
But the glory of Satguru is such that it will change.
World is following a fake Religion-Dharma. I have freed
you from treachery, fraud, etc. and transformed you from
the coveted religions of Mind. Now I changed you into a
nectarine individual. Earlier it was a reign of Mind. Even
after many lives, such a transformation is hard to achieve.
Sahib says-
Yeh Sab Sahib Tumhi Keena, Barna Main Tha Param Malina.
How did this happen? After Satya Naam you got
powers which fights with vices; Lust, Anger, Greed etc.
First, let's look at their whole army.
Pratham Kaam Dhanush Kar Leenhe, Panch Ban So Tasang
Cheenhe.
Mohan Vashikaran Uchata, Ban Lagat Ghar Bhoole Bat.
Dusht Kaan Ur Prakate Aayi, Gyan Vichar Bisri Sab Jai.
Ritu Basant Triye Sain Singara, Kahi Na Kaam Ki Sen Apara.
Solah Shringar Dekhi Man Mani, Nirkhat An Ang Ki Vani.
Aisi Nirkhi Kaal Ki Sena, Sur Nar Muni Ur Dharat Na Chaina.
God of Lust has five arrows-


64 Sahib Bandgi
Maaran, Maran, Mohan, Vashikaran and Uchattan.
With these lust disables everyone’s intellect. Then there is
no difference then between Human, Munis or the Deities.
They lose their peace. After their attack everyone is

Yeh Kama Ati Prachand Hai, Hoye Utpan Tiye Ang.

Tan Man Asthir Na Rahe, Kaam Ban Dar Sal.
Ek Ban Se Sab Kiye, Sur Nar Muni Vihal.
This Lust is very strong, it even distracts the powerful
devotees of penance. Lust takes its form in the company of
a female. It even keeps the Divine beings-Deities in its
control. Shashtras mention-
Chalai Kaam Yeh Sabai Palane,Maharudra Ki Karat Na Kane.
Maharudra Pahan Pahunche Jani,Maryo Puhup Ban Shar Tani.
Dekh Amini Mohe Deva, Puhup Ban Ko Kuchh Lahtro Na Bheva.
Chhandi Dhyan Dhaye Tripurari, Samujhe Jabhin Pare Juhari.
It is on everyone's head. It hasn't left even Maharudra.
He got attracted to Mohini form of Vishnu. This cannot be
comprehended by ordinary people.

It even has control over 33 crore Gods and Kings. Let’s
take their king. Indra, after the defeat at the hands of
Demons, went to Gautama rishi's wife Ahilya See, what is
the condition of deities under lust. Then what is a common
man in front of them. Leave human, we can't even talk
about other deities if their king's condition is like this. If
someone is good then we say that person is like a Deva.
Now even the Devas king reached at the doorstep of
another woman. Gautama rishi gave him the curse of
thousand segments in his body. When lust set his eyes on
Chandra he went to the wife of his Guru. Sahib says-
Aiso Asur Ghat Mon Base, Sunhu Ho Dharamdas.
Ghat Parichay Jane Bina, Sabka Bhaya Vinash.
Tan Man Lajja Na Rahai, Kaam Ban Ur Sal.
Ek Kaam Sab Basi Kiye, Sur Nar Muni Vihal.
This lust is very dangerous. It has its own family. Its
wife is Rati. Son is greed and Daughter in law is obsession.
These are very Evil .Furthermore-
Shringi Rishi Jo Van Mahan Jaye,
Kand Mool Khani Ban Phal Khaye.
Aisan Gyan Dhyan Man Dharai,
Sou Kaam Vasi Phiri Phiri Parai.
Shringi rishi had made his body like wood. He used to
live in a cave in the deep forest a prostitute had him in her
control and then he also became the father of three
children. When he came to his senses he left everything
and went back to the forest.
When lust becomes heavy on a person, he does not
remain in his senses. Whan in lust, human do misconstrue
of deeds.

```
Kaam Vashi Bhaye Ravan Rau, Haran Sita Kiya Nash Upau.

66 Sahib Bandgi
Ravan was a very intelligence person, he had the
knowledge of four Vedas. But even he couldn't win from
lust and kidnapped Sita ji.
Narad Aadi Panch Shar Tani, Aur Anek Jehi Nar Gyani.
Kaam Ban Jab Dshrath Lage, Ram Chhute Tab Pranai Tyage.
Kam Bali Ati Balvanda, Jasu Ban Rahe Vikal Brahmand.
Even Narad ji could not resisit lust. This excites the
whole universe.
Now let’s see the Anger. It’s like twin brother of lust.
Sahib says-
Kam Te Adhik Krodh Prachanda, Jake Dar Trase Nau Khanda.
Guru Kubudhi Krodh Ke Sanga, Adhar Bhesh Dhari Chadat Jo
Anga.
Jab Ur Krodh Pragate Aai, Kampai Deh That That Ho Jai.
Tedhi Bhauhein Ankit Naina, Ashubh Asar Mukh Bole Baina.
Jare Hriday Mukh Nikse Jhara, Rom Rom Pavak Par Jara.
Mar Mar Karai Apghata, Ginai Na Mat Pita Au Bhrata.
Dui Jaye Kai Vinshai Aapa, Darun Hiya Krodh Kai Rupa.
This anger is also very dangerous. When it rises in the
heart then the whole body starts to tremble. Eyebrows
bends, eyes become red and we abuse. Every pore burns
with anger. Then Man doesn't care what is good for him
and what is not. His intellect gets veiled and he even does
the works which are usually done by the stupid persons.
This Anger has caused serious problem even to Mahatmas.
Anger's wife is violence and Son is indiscrimination, its
Kinsman is forgetfulness. When anger arrives it brings
destruction. Anger has created great destructions in this
world from time to time. Sahib says-
Prathame Krodh Brahma Ko Bhayau, Shat Putran Kahan Shap
Jo Dayau
Sankadik Vaikunthe Gayau, Rokat Pauri Krodh Man Bhayau.
Jab Jab Shiv Krodh Karai Sansara, Parlaye Hot Na Lage Bara.

Chhapan Koti Yadav Sanghara, Aapuhin Aap Krodh Arjara.

Brahma ji is the creator of the world. This is not an
ordinary thing, this needs a thought. He incinerated six
sons by cursing. Sankadi Rishis were going to Vaikunth.
They became angry when they were stopped by the
Gatekeepers and in anger they cursed them to take three
lives of Demons. When shiv ji become angry he destroys
the three loks. This is a known fact. Durvasa rishi couldn't
win against anger and incinerated 56 0 Million Yadavs
(People who rear Cow).
See, the power of anger is great, it has a control over
great beings Whole world is under its control.
Krodh Agni Ghat Ghat Bari, Jarat Sakal Sansar.

We can only save ourselves from it by Surrendering to

in the fire of anger.

The one who abandon anger transcends this world.
When anger arrives in the heart then all sense of
discriminations departs. If someone is able to bind the five
senses, overcome hunger and thirst even then when anger
arrives it finishes everything off. This anger disrupts every
work and the good result is never achieved.
Bahut Jatan Tap Kineu, Sab Phal Krodh Nasaye.
Kahain Kabir Dhan Sanchai, Chor Musi Lai Jaye.
Devotees worship with great hardships but when anger

68 Sahib Bandgi
someone has collected all the wealth and then it is stolen
from him. Similar is the case with anger. Let’s see this
Greed after anger. Sahib says-
Bura Lobh Te Aur Na Koi, Sakal Adharm Lobh Te Hoi.
This Greed is the root of all the sins. Its wife is
ambition and its Son is Sin the story of this cupidity is also
very interesting.
Pahile Paisa Mon Man Lavai, Paisa Mile Taka Ko Dhave.
Taka Dekhi Man Mein Sukh Bhayau, Dotaka Ka Udhham Kiyau.

We get ten then we desire twenty, if we get twenty then
we desire fifty, if we get fifty we desire hundred, if we get
hundred then we desire thousand, then lakh and then crore.
This cupidity never leaves. Kabir Sahib tells Dharamdas-
Kalyug Vairag As Hovve Bhai,
Sunu Dharamdas Main Kahaun Bujhai.
Kalyug Pap Karm Bahu Badhihain,
Kari Kari Pap Dukh Mein Parihain.

Vishay Bhog Ko Dravya So Chahi,

Trishna Ai Parbal Jag Bhangi,
Sada Rahai Veh Lobh Ki Sangi.
Sahib says because of greed the human commit sins in
Kaliyug and goes through a lot of pain and hardships for
that. In Kaliyug, so called holy men beg in the name of
Religion and make wealth for themselves. They have greed
and hunger for the lust. This hunger is the wife of greed
which always remain beside him. This Greed is more
harmful in comparison to lust and anger, therefore sahib
says-
Kami Nar Bahute Tare, Krodhi Tare Anant.
Lobhi Banda Na Tare, Kahain Kabir Sidhant.
There is not one or two in the clutches of cupidity.
Bhagat Mudiya Jatdhari, Gyani Guni Apar.
Shat Darhan Bhatkat Phire, Ek Lobh Ki Lar.
Then there comes the Attachment-Moha. He is the
king. Sahib says-
Moh Sakal Vyadhin Ko Moola, Ta Te Upjat Bahi Vidhi Soola.
This is the root cause of all the troubles. It arises out of
Maya.
Moh Nripti Maya Te Bhayau, Prabal Ghata Tihun Pur Si Chhayau.
Varno Tasu Naam Gun Baina, Maha Moh Raja Ko Saina.
The King attachments also has very big family.

Attachment lives in the country of ignorance. His wife
is ambition. Daughter is desire, son is greed, minister is
phony, general is treachery and friend is disease. Thus, the
family of endearment is a great one along with a big army.
It is not easy to save oneself from this army, hence sahib
says-
Yeh Sena Sab Moh Ki, Kahain Kabir Samjhaye.
Inte Jo Koi Bachai, Bhavsagar Tari Jaye.
Inte J Koi Bachai, Bhavsagartari Jaye.
In the end there is Pride. This is the most dangerous
one. Its wife is decry-hate. Arrogance leads you to decry
someone. Some people are Pride of beauty, color, caste
wealth or even education .When pride arrives then the
being doesn't find anyone above himself.
Chhin Chhin Garv Hiya Mein Aave,

A Proud person doesn't listen to others. He even abuses
verbally. He thinks and moves as if there is no one in his
league .Sahib says-

Sahib says that one should be free from Pride. This
arrogance destroys everything else. He can never attain
Salvation. He never talk straight and his every word is

concerned with I, me, and myself. A King is proud of his
status and a Yogi is proud of his yog.
So these five are pretty much evil. These five are the
hands of Mind with which he is bending everyone
according to his desires. Humans are not alert towards it.
Sahib warns-
Chashm Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashe Ho Rahe.......

The day Satguru graces one with Naam, from that day
there is total protection of the Naam on that Discipe, effect
of vices will be checked, just as how a farmers protect the
seed from pests. The moment the pests try to consume the
seed, it is eleminated. Similarly, Guru protects you from
inside with Satya Naam. Guru protects you from Maya and
Mind just like water proof watches are safeguarded from
water, Naam also safeguards you from Maya. It is
safeguarded from Mind, lust, Anger, Evil spirits and
Planets. Humans are not safe from them. I listened to a
Mahatma's satsang. When he raised his hand, he had rings
with gem stones for protection from stars (on his fingers).
Now think about it, the person who himself fears stars and
planets, how will he protect his disciples.
When mahatmas says that do this and do that for relief,
I know that, they don't know the formula to protect oneself
from Mind. Because-
Kitne Tapsi Tap Kar Dare, Kaya Dari Gara.
Grih Chho Bhaye Sanyasi, Tau Na Pavat Para.
Without Naam no one can overcome the Mind. Naam
provide a complete protection.
Satguru Shabad Sahai, Nikat Gaye Tan Rog Na Vyapai,
Paap Tap Mit Jai.
With the power of Naam the physical worries will
diminish, and you will keep away from evil deeds. All

types of evils like physical, materialistic and mystical will
be diminished.
Jabhi Naam Hirde Bhaya, Bhaya Paap Ka Nash.
Jaise Chingi Aag Ki, Pari Purani Ghas.
Like a matchstick which can burn a whole bunch of
straws after the fire catches at least one straw. Similarly,
the heart which possesses the Naam that heart will have no
space for evil thoughts anymore.
There is a summation in these things. Does an evil
thought really vanish from heart after Naam? Yes, after
Naam no one can incline towards the evil deed, not even
when you want to. That power takes hold on your
conscience. They say- Satguru Shabd Sahai. Satgutu gives
Soundless Naam of Parm Purush. Furthermore-
Athvan Pathvan Drishti Na Lage, Ulte Tihi Dhar Khai.
Maran Mohan Vashikaran Kar, Man Hi Man Pachhitai.
It is said that the person who thinks ill of you will fall
in his own ditch. Tantric powers will not work against you.
Lust will fail to attract you. Not only that-
Jade Yantra Yukti Nahin Lage, Shabd Ke Baa Dahai.
Ojha Dayan Ur Dar Urpe, Zehar Jood Ho Jai.
In front of shabad-Naam no Voodoo or witchcraft can
stay. The one who cast them will feel the fear. Even poison
will fail to work in front of Naam.
Vishdhar Man Mein Kar Pachhtava, Bahuri Nikat Nahin Aai.
Kahain Kabir Kato Yam Phanda, Sukriti Lakh Duhai.
The web of kaal is cut down with the help of Naam.
Naam will protect you like an amour. It will provide you
with the comfort of this world and the other one.
Jo Sukh Ko Chaho Sada, To Sharan Naam Ka Leh.
The day you get Naam, you possess both the power of
this world and the other. That's why sahib says-
Satyanam Ke Pattare, Deve Ko Kachhu Nahin.
Kya Le Guru Santoshiye, Yeh Havas Rahi Man Mahin.
When you get Naam, the internal enemies don't hold
any sward over you because after that you possess the
power to fight them. Forgiveness and love fight against

these enemies. Vivek is the king of these. Let's go towards
the army of Vivek. It has its origin from Param Purush
Aise Param Purush Ke Anshu,
Prakatein Prem Vivek Sukh Vansh.
Now where is this?
Gyan Desh Prakash Rajdhani, Anand Roopi Vivek Parvani.
Vivek-Spiritual wisdom stays in the country of wisdom
and wherever it is present, there would also be the light of
knowledge. Therefore it provides bliss.
Sunhu Vivek Raj Ki Saina, Jake Raj Sakal Sukh Chaina.

Patience, Righteousness and Wisdom are its Soldiers
who help the King Vivek at every whim. Its wife is Faith.
Forgiveness and compassion are its two Daughters. Good
intellect is the servants of the King Vivek. Its State
Minister is fearlessness and the Minister is strictness,
servant is truth.

Jhoothe Ahi Deh Ko Nata, Ye Sab Maya Ker Samato.

Patience, Right conduct, and Wisdom help the King
Vivek. When the wisdom follows its path from the heart,
then the web of kaal Vanishes. Desire has woven the whole
world. But wisdom says that all the pleasure, luxury, wife
and so on are maya. Like clouds make shadow for a short
time similarly, the pleasure of maya lasts for a short time.
All the pleasures are like dreams, it will not of much
relevance later. Relations of this body are fake, on the
death of this body there would be no mother, father or
wife. When this type of knowledge takes root in the heart
then there is no place for attachments.
Pragate Prem Vivek Dal, Kahain Kabir Samjhai.
Ugragyan Ati Bali, Jehi Suni Moh Darai.
With the grace of the Satguru when they enter the heart,
Vivek illumines the conscience. Then the army of Vivek
fights with lust and anger and emerge victorious. This is
not by accident, there is a raging internal war happening
inside everyone. This is a unique war. Those who don't
have Satya Naam are unable to win this war on their own.
Sahib has described about their war.
After seeing the army of Vivek, desire gets unsettled
and after that tries to throw them out of their domain.
Tabhin Moh Mantra Upjava, Pakhand Mira Nikat Bulava.
Aaye Prabal Vivek Naresha, Linhe Aai Hamaro Desha.
Ab Mati Mantra Karo Thehrai, Desh Aapno Lehu Chhudai.

Aage Aage Kam Reh Bharpooori, Gyan Vivek Jahi Sab Doori.
Tabhin Kam Kahan Aayesu Diyau,
Dal Badal Seh Reh So Gayau.
Desire then send for his friend falsehood and tells him
that Vivek has taken over their domain, there is no power
for then in there. Then falsehood advise him to send lust in


Changing the world spiritually 75
to the battlefield. The one to face lust is wisdom which
unseats the lust to face wisdom in the reign of mind.
Kam Kupit Vachan Sunayo, Hamre Desh Gyan Kahan Aayo.
Utai Bhayo Kam Utai Bhayo Gyana,
Mana Bhoomi Rachyo Sangrama.
Lust thinks where from does wisdom has arrived into
our domain. Then the two of them get ready to fight.
Bahu Rpi Dhari Kam Tivana, Tabh Chalavai Pancho Bana.
Nishfal Kiyo Tahi Tab Gyana, Surti Shabd Lai Rahe Nidana
Lust sends weapons like Maran, Mohan but with the
help of Surti wisdom disables them.
Gyan Vichar Uthhe Gal Gaj, Kam Nillaj Na Kahe Bhaji.
Dhig Tiya Dhig Dhig As Raja, Nirghin Rudhir Mans Ko Saja.
Had Twacha Mukh Rom Pasara, Nav Dwar Bahain Ati Khara.
Raint Nak Makh Kaf Lara, Keechad Ankhin Kane Chhara.
Nakh Nikh Vyadhi Sabai Bistara, Vishthha Mutra Tiya Tan Bhara.
Vahi Ranchai So Pavai Dikhu, Sapne Nahin Tehi Hoye Sukhu.
Dukh Ki Rashi Jo Raji Koi, Sacho Narak Aahi Puni Soi.
Yeh Kahi Gyan Raha Thehrai, Kam Sain Darai Vichlai.
Vichlayo Kam Gayo Khisiyai, Ugra Gyan Te Kachhu Na Basai.
In front of lust knowledge thinks that a female body is
made up of flesh and blood. Every pore contain dirty
fluids. These are secreting from nine doorways. Cough and
drool flows from mouth and bad fluids from eyes. You
can't even obtain pleasure from these even in dreams. This
is similar to drowning in hell.
Just like that the army of lust got troubled after
listening to the words of Wisdom. Even after numerous
efforts, lust was unable to defeat wisdom and in the end
wisdom emerged victorious.
Kam Kahai Yeh Niki Sundri, Kahai Gyan Yeh Vish Ki Dehri.
Kam Kahai Yake Dhig Jai, Gyankahai Yeh Sanpin Ahai.
Kam Kahai Kamini Sam Toola, Gyan Kahai Yeh Vishkar Moola.
Kamasakt Kudrishti San Rata, Yan Sakti Kar Bolai Mata.
Yeh Suni Bahut Ajab Bhau Kama, Sahatro Gyan Hamaro
Sangrama.
Lust tries to attract, see over that beauty but wisdom
perceives poisonous things in them. Lust says to go over


76 Sahib Bandgi
there but wisdom says that she is a snake, she will bite.
Similarly wisdom emerges as the winner in fight against
the lust.
Without the power of Naam even great men can fall flat
on their faces. Then there comes the turn of anger after
lust.
Vichlayo Kam Moh Pahan Gayeu, Sabhi Vritant Sunavan Layeu.
Man Mein Moh Bahut Pachhtai, Bolai Krodh Ko Baat Sunai.
Aai Krodh Jab Thhadhe Raheu, Tabhi Moh Krodh Se Kaheu.
Tamas Tej Naam Mohi Krudha, Karu Vivek Gyan So Yudha.
Kahan As Prabal Tohi Ko Sahai, Tore Tej Gyan Kahan Rahe.
Defeated, lust then goes to desire and tells him about
his defeat in fight against wisdom. Then desire calls anger
and tells him to go to battlefield as wisdom will not be able
to stand against anger.
Yeh Suni Krodh Chala Samuhai, Kari Gavan Phuncha Ran Aai.
Tan Mein Aai Kiyo Parvesha, Chhado Gyan Hamaro Desha.
Jo Tum Nischay Jeeto Kama, To Ab Moso Karo Sangrama.
Upon arriving, anger tells wisdom to leave their
domain. You have won against lust, now fight against me.
We hear stories about demons about their cruel nature.
There are the bigger demons which reside within you.
....The words of anger unnerves the wisdom and he goes to
Vivek. Then the king asks his advisor as whom to send to
destroy the anger?
Tab Raja Mantrin So Kahai, Prabal Krodh Kehi Karan Dahai.
Tab Sabhi Mili Mantra Vichara, Yeh To Jaye Kshma Te Mara.
Boli Vivek Kshma So Kahai, Tum To Jai Krodh Ran Bahai.
Bhakti Gyan Tehi Dei Sahai, Prabal Krod Ko Maro Jai.
Yehi Suni Kshma Rope Ran Aai, Linho Sheel Jo Dhanush Chadai.
Then it is concluded that Anger could be defeated with
the hands of forgiveness. Then, forgiveness goes to
battlefield to fight with Anger along with devotion and
wisdom. Forgiveness departs with calm.
Dekhi Kshma Krodh Chale Dhayi,
Mansa Bhoomi Ropyo Ran Aayi.
Maran Krodh Uthhe Jab Dhayi, Itne Kshma Deenah Muskai.


Changing the world spiritually 77
Krodh Aan Tab Gari Gai, Suni Kshma Anboli Bhayi.

Kopai Krodh Pavan Jyon Dolai.
Kshma Se Agin Sheetal Hai Jai, Jaise Jal Mein Agni Bujhai.
Yehi Vidhi Krodh Kshma Se Bhirai,
Maahu Angar Pani Mahan Parai.
When Anger rushes forward to attack, forgiveness
smiles. Anger abuses but forgiveness remains silent. Then,
forgiveness says sweet words and the fire of anger calms
down like water on fire. So the fight of Anger and
forgiveness is like water on burning coals.
Bhalo Bhalo Sab Koi Kahai, Rahi Gai Kshma Duhai.
Kahain Kabir Sheetal Bhaye, Gayi So Agni Bujhai.
The fire of Anger could only be sated by forgiveness.
Whenever anger arises, one wishes to hit and abuse another
being. Sahib says-
Gali Aavat Ek Hai, Ultat Hot Anek.
Kahain Kabir Na Paltiye, Rahe Ek Ki Ek.
After the defeat of both lust and Anger, Greed is called
by Desire and sent to battlefield.
Haryo Krodh Kam Jab Jana, Mahamoh Raja Dar Mana.
Chakit Moh Mantri Hankrava, Samukh Moh Vivek Darava.
Lobh Mantri Aap Bhaye Thadha, Dekhat Rav Chhobhati Badha.
Tab Lobh Mohhi Math Navai, Kahu Raja Mohi Kahe Bulai.
Haun Nij Sarv Pap Ka Mula, More Te Tum Rehat Hau Phula.
Jeetaun Gyan Vivek Hi Jayi, Desh Aapno Leu Chhudai.
To Kahan Phir Main Dehaun Raju, Mahamoh More Bal Gaju.
After the defeat of both lust and anger, Desire gets
scared but greed assures him that as long as he is present
Wisdom and Vivek will not be able to take over their
domain. He is the root of all the evils and wisdom can't
stand before me.
Yeh Sun Harsh Moh Man Bhayeu,
Takshan Lobh Ko Aayesu Dayau.
After hearing the words of greed, desire becomes
composed and sends him to the battlefield with best
wishes. Greed tells wisdom-
Jai Ran Diyo Lobh Hankara, Yan Tum Ka Arhu Takrara.


78 Sahib Bandgi
Hum Bandobast Kiyo Parvesha, Chhodhu Gyan Hamaro Desha.
Tajhu Gyan Tum Humro Thhaun,

Nahin Jano Tum Krodh Au Kama.
Haun Ati Prabal Lobh Mohi Nama.
Chhadhu Gyan Hamaro Thhaun,
Nahin To Tohi Dhari Dhari Khaun.
Greed then tells wisdom that "I am very ruthless. Leave
our domain, you can't keep your feet in front of me. If you
don't leave our domain I will swallow you". After hearing
this, wisdom once again goes back to king Vivek (Spiritual
Discremination) and says-

Jo Tum Lobh Jeeto Aaju, To Tum Karo Nikantak Raju.
Wisdom says that it can't win against greed. Then
minister says that Contentment can win over Greed. The
king calls Contentment and sends him to battle with Greed
alongside Wisdom and Devotion.

Udasi Shakti Urmein Upjayi, Kampyo Lobh Jyon Vish Khayi.
Dhiraj Khadag Gaharo Santosha,

There is a fierce battle between greed and contentment.
Greed throws the power of worry that there would be
nothing without money but Contentment uses wisdom to
disable it. Cupidity shows the greed for money, gold and
diamonds but contentment shows that even the greatest
kings couldn't take away these things with them after
death, all of it is still here. After eruption of sadness in the
Heart, Greed is defeated by Contentment. This irritates
the Desire without end.
Kam Moh Krodh Vichle, Vichle Lobh Akaj.
Mahamoh Manmahan Jhakhe, Gayo Hamaro Raj.
After the defeat of Lust, Anger and Greed, Desire fears the
loss of his reign.
Moh Bulaye Garv San Kaheu, Vichlo Sabai Ek Tum Raheu.
Ab Mero Tum Karo Sahau, More Sang Garv Uthhi Dhau.
Gan Vivek Ko Mari Bhagaven, Jap Tap Sadhan Mari Sab Laven.

Moh Dal Jab Pahunche Ranmahin,

Sajyo Sen Tab Bahu Samudai, Hoye Nishank Chale Ran Bhai.
Utate Moh Ran Rang Machava, It Vivek Raja Chadi Aava.
Desire then calls forward Pride and tells him that he is
now the only one who can beat wisdom and drive out from
my domain. The pride then assures desire that where ever
he stays there Vivek and Wisdom can't prevail. Then,
Desire along with his whole army goes to the battlefield.
When Vivek hears that Desire is coming with his whole
Army then he also gets ready and starts towards the
battlefield.
Dekhyo Garv Moh Sakana, Kari Krodh Ban Sandhana.

Raja Mokhan Aayus Dehu, Kaun Ban Te Marau Ehu.
Pride then face off Wisdom. Pride shoots the arrows of
unconsciousness and Wisdom shoots that of awakening.
But when he is unable to finish Pride, he goes to Vivek and
asks for advice.
Deen Tab Ban Raja Kar Layeu, Hit Kai Ugra Gyan Kahin Dayeu.
Marayo Gyan Deen Tehi Bana, Haryo Garv Lagyo Virhana.
Then the king gives him the arrow of Pity. With that
arrow the Pride vanishes which puts the Desire in a very
difficult position.
Garv Muye Vikal Hoi, Chale Aap Ranmahin.
Manhin Man Pachhtavai, Mor Kushal Ab Nahin.
Then, Desire steps forward to take part in the battle.

Maha Moh Raye Mum Nama, Saho Gyan Moro Sangrama.

Desire then howls the battle cry and says that you have
defeated my warriors, now you can't win against me. I will
finish you.
Kahai Vivek Badka Hako, Karo Ladai Nashhi Tako.
Vivek replies that you should stop saying that and start
fighting. There will only be your end.
Sunat Moh Krodh Tab Kinha, Dhanush Uthhaye Kar Gahi Linha.
Mamta Ban Tabhin Tana, Vichitra Ban Vivek Sandhana.
Aalas Shakti Moh Upjai, Chaitan Shakti Vivek Chalai.
Then in Anger Desire shoots the arrow of Affection.
Here Vivek disables it by arrow of quirk-sense of Humor.
Desire shoots the power of laziness and Vivek sends the
power of Awakening. A fierce battle begins.
Nidra Shakti Moh Sanchari, Jagrat Shakti Vivek Tahan Mari.
Moh Phans Maya Bistari, Vivek Vichar Chhinak Mahan Tari.

Vichlayo Mh Dashahu Dishi Gayeu, Supanth Sakal Dwandav

Now Desire creates Sleeping power but Vivek disables
it with power of awakening. Desire expands the web of
maya but Vivek gets out of it. Now Desire spreads
Darkness-ignorance. Seeing this, Vivek laughs and says
that this is your power. Then Vivek shoots the arrow of
Light and dispels darkness. After this, with the arrow of
Truth, Vivek finishes Desire's servant lie. Now Vivek
shoots arrow of Wisdom which renders Desire
unconscious.
Kahai Kabir Vivek Dal, Atal Gyan Dal Gaj.
Ab To Nirmal Ho Gaye, Gaye Moh Dal Bhaj.
So like this, after Naam these enemies become weak.
They still exist however they are unable to affect you, they
remain unconscious. Sahib says-
Satguru Mara Tani Ke, Shabd Surange Ban.
Mera Mara Phir Jiye, To Hath Na Gahun Kaman.
Now let’s see the Satya Naam and its glory, where did
it came from.Listen...
Kag Palat Hansa Ker Deena. Aisa Purush Naam Main Deena.
I have blessed with such a holy Naam related to Param
Purush that has turned a crow like jiva into a Hansa-The
celestial Swan. With this Naam Gunas-Tendencies and
Desire, Lust, Anger, Lust etc. comes under control, Soul
becomes a Hansa with the touch of Paramhans.
Sar Nam Satguru Se Paye, Chhar Akshar Se Para.
Ab Bhaya Re Guru Ka Bachcha, Ab Pucca Re Pucca.
When he gets the holy Name from a real Satguru, which is
beyond the Sound and word, then only he is an
accomplished one.


82 Sahib Bandgi

## c. Origin of True Naam

After being manifested from Param Purush, some souls
got imprisoned in the hands of Niranjan. Niranjan didn't let
even a single soul to return back to Amarlok. Everyone is
dancing on the fingertips of Niranjan. Niranjan has bound
the beings in the system of boon or bane. The virtuous and
sinful then heads to heaven or hell alongside the cycle of
84 lakh yonis. After this painful journey they are then
given the privilege of human body which is knowledgeable
and intelligent but it is also accompanied by pain. Human
body has been provided as the chance for freedom from
this confinement. But the beings were only able to reach
till Niranjan because there is no one else to impart the
knowledge that is beyond that point. Not a single being
was able to reach Amarlok.
Niranjan fried the beings on hot rock and ate them, he
even gave troubles and miseries to them. They cried that if
there is some Real God then please help us, save us, we
can't endure anymore pain from Kalpurush.
The cry of the beings cut through the seven skies and
reached the fourth lok, Amarlok. Param Purush came to
know that the beings are in deep pain. Then, he calls forth
Kabir Sahib and told him to go to shiny. Niranjan is
causing miseries to the Souls and they are crying out due to
the punishment meted out by Niranjan. Free the beings
from the web of kaal and bring them to Amarlok.
Kar Parnaam Gyani Chale, Karan Hans Ke Kaj.
Jopai Kal Na Mani Hain, Tumhin Purush Ko Laj.
Therefore Sahib comes in every Yuga in to the world of
Niranjan and frees the beings from kaal and take them back
to Amarlok. When first Sahib came on earth, he stayed for
100 years but he couldn't take a single person back with
him. Param Purush then asked him as to why didn't he
bring anyone with him? Sahib replied that-when he make a
person understand, he forgets about it by the evening. If he
makes him understand in the evening they forget by


Changing the world spiritually 83
morning. Niranjan gives them mental confusion, I feel sad,
and what can I do. Then Param Purush gave him the
hidden thing (Naam) and said “To whom so ever you give
this thing, he will not be under the control of Kaal again.
Then with the permission of Param Purush, Sahib again
visited the World of Niranjan in Shunya (Earth). When
Sahib was entering Niranjan saw and met Sahib at
Jhanjhari Island and there took place a big debate between
the two of them. Sahib says-
Taso Kehayo Suno Dharmai, Jeev Kaj Sansar Sidhai.
Tapt Shila Par Jeev Jaravahu, Jari Vari Nij Swad Karavahu.
Tum As Kasht Jeev Keh Deenha, Tabhi Purush Mohi Agya Kinha.
Jeev Chitaye Lok Lai Jaun, Kaal Kasht Se Jeev Bachaun.
Sahib told Niranjan, that he has bound the beings by
unfair means. You have given untold misries by putting
them on hot stones. You are enjoying their suffering. You
have stolen their blissful stste. Param Purush has sent me
here, I will release and take them away to Amarlok.
Tabai Niranjan Bole Bani, Sakal Jeev Bas Hamare Gyani.
Tinsau Sath Paith Urjhera, Kaise Hansan Lev Ubera.
Niranjan said that he has kept all beings in confusion.
There are 360 (holy) places where he has kept small
powers by seeing them humen are entangled. Niranjan
asked than how I will you release these Swans-Hansa?
Tab Gyani As Bole Bani, Jamte Jeev Chhudavahun Aani.
Purush Naam Ko Kahun Samjhai, Jam Raja Ta Chhodi Parai.
Ghat Ghat Baithe Urjhera, Hamre Shabd Te Hoye Nibera.
Sun Re Kaal Dusht Anyai, Shabd Sang Hansa Ghar Jai.
Sahib said he has the thing ‘Naam’ with which Hansa-
(Swan)-soul will reach Amarlok. You will be unable to
hurt them. Then Niranjan said-
Ka Giyani Deho Adhikara, Hamro Nahin Chhoote Jam Jara.
Panch Pachees Teen Gun Aahi, Yeh Lai Sakal Shareer Banai.
Tamein Paap Punya Ka Vasa, Man Baitha Le Hamri Phansa.
Jahan Tahan Jag Bharmavai,
Gyan Sandhi Kuchh Rehan Na Pavai.
Ek Shabd Ki Ketik Asha, Mere Ahin Chaurasi Phansa.


84 Sahib Bandgi
Niranjan Said that Sahib will be unable to free and take
them away. I have created the human body and bound it
with the five tatvas. Then, they are further bound by Sins
and merits. Then in the form of mind I am myself present
within them. I do not give then clear inquiry. Your one
word-Naam can do nothing. I have created trap of 84 lakh
yonis and I make them struggle from one form to another.
Bole Gyani Shabd Vichari, Chhoote Chaurasi Ki Dhari.
Chootai Panch Pachis Gun Teeno,
Aisa Shabd Purush Main Deenhaun.
Sahib told that he has a very powerful satya Naam. The
one with Satya Naam will not be under your control
anymore. He would be free then. Niranjan said-
He Gyani Ka Karo Badhai, Hamte Nahin Chhoot Jeev Jai.
Itne Yug Bhaye Tum Dekha, Gyani Hans Na Eko Pekha.
Ka Tum Karo Ka Shabd Tumara, Teen Lok Parlaye Kar Dara.
Sadhu Sant Hum Dekkhi Reeti, Parlaye Pare Sakal Jagag Jeeti.
Karam Rekh Bandhai Sab Sadha, Sun Nar Muni Saklo Jag
Bandha.
Niranjan said it has been so many yugas. Tell me is
there even one being that has reached Amarlok. I have
bound the beings with so much power that they can't get
free. What can you and your one word can do? I can
destroy the three worlds.
Niranjan has destroyed earth many times. This is not
the work of Sahib. Therefore Niranjan said it’s not only the
common man, he has even entangled Munis and Divine
beings with actions and reactions. I will not let even a
single Swan-Soul get away.
Gyani Kahai Kal Anyai, Shabd Bina Tu Khaye Chabai.
Han Hamara Shabd Adhikara, Purush Partap Ko Kare Samhara.
Naam Japai Aru Surti Lagai, Mile Karm Lage Nahin Kai.
Shabd Mani Hoye Shabd Sarupa, Nishchay Hansa Hoye Anupa.
Sahib told Niranjan that is because they didn't had the
true Naam that's why he could swallow them. But now he
will give them the powerful Naam of Param Purush which
will release his grip from them. They will even be able to


Changing the world spiritually 85
understand the concept of Sin or Merit by themselves.
Naam will protect them and it will cut down all that binds
and take the being to Amar lok.
Nirgun Kal Tab Bole Bani, Urjhe Jeev Sakal Jamkhani.
Kaise Ke Tum Shabd Pasaro, Kaune Vidhi Tum Jeev Ubaro.
Aise Jeev Sakal Hain Karni, Kaise Pahunche Purush Ki Sarni.
Jag Mein Jeev Kroodh Vikara, Kaise Pahunche Purush Ke Dwara.
Niranjan told that he had bound humans in viciousness
of lust and anger, then how will they reach Amar lok. After
that he has placed 14 Yamdoots (Lord of Death) in every
body. How will you get them out? He said that being
became very dirty, nobody will listen to you.
Gyani Kahe Karhu Variyara, Hamto Keenah Sakal Nirvara.
Joi Gyani Hoye Hamara, Kaam Krodh Te Hoye Niyara.
Trisna Lobhhi Dei Bahai, Vishai Janm Sab Door Parai.
Naam Dhyan Bal Hansa Ghar Jai, Kya Re Kaal Tum Karo Badai.
Sahib said the body which receives Satya Naam will no
longer answer to you. Lust and Anger will also be disabled
and they will become clean. You cannot touch them and
they will assume the nature of Hansa and fly away to Amar
lok.
Kahe Niranjan Suno Ho Gyani, Kathi Ho Gyan Tumhari Bani.
Yugat Mahatam Sabai Bataun,
Tumhara Naam Le Panth Chalaun.
Then Niranjan said that he will also start his own panth
on Sahib's name. See around yourself, there are numerous
Satgurus and Sants in this world. Everyone is giving Naam
Diksha. This is all the Domain of Niranjan. The content is
of Niranjan but the Naam is of Sants. So Niranjan said-
Gyani Mor Aparbal Gyana, Ved Kitan Bharam Hum Mana.
Inko Mane Sab Sansara, Kali Mein Ganga Mukti Dwara.
Dehi Dan Se Utre Para, Aise Sumrit Kahe Vichara.
Yeh Vidhi Kag Jeev Bhulahin,
Jara Maran Sab Bandh Bandhahi.
Sutak Patak Ved Vichara, Puchh Ved Se Karhi Sanhara.
Ekadashi Mukti Ko Bhai, Yog Jagya Karve Adhikai.


86 Sahib Bandgi
Said that he had bound them in the verses of Vedas,
Karmas and Dharmas. They follow them. Niranjan has
talked about only himself in the Vedas and Scriptures. He
has created the Vedas. Therefore, the secret of Sahib is not
in there. So he told that no one will listen to Kabir Sahib,
therefore asked him not to go in to the world. Sahib says-
Sunhu Kal Gyan Ki Sandh, Chhoro Jeev Sakal Ki Fandi.
Jab Nij Bira Hansa Pavai, Yog Barat Tap Sabai Nasabai.
Ved Kitab Ki Chhode Aasa, Hana Kre Shabd Visvasa.
Take Nikat Kaal Nahin Aavai, Nij Bira Jo Surat Lagavai.
Jog Barat Pathu Hai Chhara, Adbhut Naam Sada Rakhvara.
Kabir Sahib Said, that the one with Naam will not
follow any superstitions. Then he will be free from all this
materalistic beliefs. Naam will protect him and Kaal will
be unable to go near him.

Note:-
Niranjan is the fifth son of Param Purush, born out of
word. He is known as Nirakar Niranjan, Adi Narayan, Adi
Shiv, Adi Brahman and Mind etc. This world addresses
him as Rama, Brahma, Shiva, and also remaind him as
Niranjan, Kadar, Kareem, Parameshwar, Paramatma, Hari,
Non dual and Alak Niranjan etc. This Niranjan is given
thousand names in Religious Scriptures.
Then Niranjan grew angry and said you threw me out
of Mansarovar and now you have come into my world. I
will take revenge. Then he changed his form in to that of a
giant elephant and pounced on Sahib.
Gyani Purush Shabd Kiyo Jora, Pakad Soond Dant Gahi Mora.
Mareu Shabd Panye Par Peli, Tor Soond Samudra Gahi Meli.
Purush Roop Tabhin Puni Dhara, Jan Sarup Sakal Autara.
Sahib says that he then changed into his original Param
Purush form and threw the elephant by his trunk into the
ocean.
Niranjan suffered and pleaded for mercy in front of
Sahib and said he is very blessed to have his Dharsan. He
said, you can go in this world, but if you take away all


Changing the world spiritually 87
these beings then what will happen to my curse it will be
nullified? The ones who will commit evil deeds in this
worldly ocean of life, will they also go with you? Then
Sahib said the beings that will follow my words will go to
Amarlok but the ones who will go opposite my words will
remain under your reign.
Suno Niranjan Vachan Hamara, Nahin Satt Vo Jeev Tumhara.
This is the agreement between Niranjan and sahib.
That's why I say that it’s okay if you are unable to do
bhajan but never go against my words (7 rules). You
should keep that thing safe which is given to you. I ask not
to break any rule or principle.
Satya Naam Nij Aushdhi, Khari Niyat Se Khaye.
Aushadh Khaye Aru Path Rahai, Taki Vedan Jaye.

Va Ghar Ki Sudhi Koi Na Batave, Jehvan se Hansa Aaya Hai.
Sahib Ji brought a renaissance in the world of Spiritualism.
Different sects, Panths and Religions are going ahead with the
photocopies of the sayings of Sahib Ji. He has been described as
the Sant Samrat because it is he who for the first time talked
about Amarlok and Satguru Bhakti as a Simple Path-Sahaj Marg
to attain Amarlok. After that there appeared 32 Sant Satgurus
who followed his teachings in letter and spirit but those who
came after these 32 Sants forgot the basic teachings of Sahib Ji
and became the agents of Niranjan. ‘Jo Rakhak Tahan Chihnat
Nahin, Jo Bakhak Tahan Dheyan Lagahin _’_
The reason is that the Kith and Kins of the holy Sants who
took over the Seat after the Sants, Who forgot or misunderstood
the very philosophy and the basic teachings of Sahib Ji.
Therefore got mixed up with the Bhakti of Niranjan. Even
today when we observe some sects and Panths, we find that they
are frequently reciting the sayings of Kabir Sahib Ji. But on the
whole they are worshiping the Nirakar Niranjan. All have
limited themselves up to five words, Alek Niranjan, Omkar,
Soham, Sat, and RRankar.


88 Sahib Bandgi

6. The Thing I Possess Cannot Be Found Any
   Where in This Universe

The thing I possess doesn't exist in this universe. I am
not saying this with arrogance. There is no arrogance in
this. The thing is different, when people mold these things
in their own way. But I am saying this with deep faith. I am
very cautious against arrogance. I believe that just like
cancer feeds on body, arrogance feeds on knowledge. No
matter how much the person is intelligent, arrogance will
finish him. Therefore, I am not saying this with arrogance.
This is the truth and I can prove it.
I am speaking the truth with analytical wisdom born of
practical inquiry which can be proved.
We can see many instances around us. On analysis we
find that 70% people consume meat and alcohol. Although
they are talking about devotion and are talking about the
sainthood but their eating habits are not ambrosias, also
they are not doing greater good with their deeds. They are
unethical. You are differentiated from them by preference
of food and your deeds are better than theirs. They are
corrupting and cheating but you have a steady life. You are
not able to do anything wrong. Whenever you step that
way, you are cautioned by an unknown power, warns you.
This change is witnessed in the life of every Naami. In the
matter of security, you are best and in matter of
knowledge, you are at its best. What things you need to do
and what are not to be done, these types of decisions are
taken by you without any supervision. Whenever you tend
to make a mistake you are stopped by an eternal power.
You possess this knowledge. You can feel it. You are
incredible in the field of devotion. When you look toward
others, you witness that sometimes they worship Kali and
sometimes Bhairo. They are confused and indecisive. You
on the other hand are able to see the hurdles created by the
spirits.


Changing the world spiritually 89
However a Naamis life is different, they are strong in
devotion. They are distinguished from this world. Every
being of this world is in the possession of mind. Mind
wiggles people in his hands but you are free. Mind is
unable to sway you Sahib says-
Naam Hoye To Math Namave.Na To Yeh Jag Bandh Nachave.
Undoubtedly, Mind is unable to control you. Mind
along with maya has a delirious effect on everyone but you
are not prone to it. When Mind takes control there is only
reign of lust, anger and other impurities. These things are
also within you but they are under your control. They are
unable to affect you. You are infused, with spiritual
devotion. Your community is laced with incredible powers.
You don't hurt anyone with your thought, word and deed,
you are internally serene and gay. A power is inspiring
you. You are safe. Spirits can't get near you. Even if you sit
beside a person who is not a Naami and who is beings
accompanied by a spirit then your presence will force that
spirit to leave that person. Voodoos or any sorcery would
not harm you in any way.
I believe that Sahib makes all of you realize not once or
twice but numerous times. This deed is done by Sahib
himself. Once Dharamdas ji became sad. Sahib Ji was
leaving him in his own place. Dharamdas ji said that Kal
Purush has confused everyone then how can I bring people
into devotion? Sahib told him not to worry.
Purush Shakti Jab Aan Samai. Tab Nahin Roke Kaal Kasai.
He said that when the power of Param Purush stirs then
the control of Kal Purush will slacken. On the day of Naam
Dhan the power of Param Purush is induced (through the
Paras Surati of Satguru). Then power of Kal will become
ineffective.
Keep these words in remembrance. These things are
happening to you. It can't be understand by anyone better
than yourself. You have a power guiding you, this is
known better by yourself than my words. I don’t need to


90 Sahib Bandgi
make you understand anything. That work would be done
by that vibrations. Even if I count in reverse order in
Satang, then you won't be bored. Sound is just a way of
making you understand. Ravan's heart didn't change
despite the presence of Ram. Duryodhan's heart also did
not change despite the presence of Krishna. But Sahib
says- Satguru Mor Rangrez, Chunri Mori Rang Dari.
This work is quite difficult. There are a lot of problems
in this sect or Panths which are created by Niranjan. The
things people are saying about me are all right. They are
only changing their interpretations. I take that with
optimism, never in pessimism.
Some people says that I am expert in hypnotism and I
am controlling people by that. They are right. “The thing I
possess is not present in this universe”. They are giving it
the name of hypnotism. Sants radiate spiritual radiations
which has the power of awakening. For them this is
hypnotism. The others are saying that he changes the
religion. That is also correct. The world is following the
religion of Niranjan, I am making them follow the
Devotion of Param Purush. I oppose nothing. I am not
taking their words negatively.
So the change through which you are undergoing is not
at all ordinary one. You have become different from this
world. Your bad deeds have been omitted. If a Guru is
hesitating in pointing the Disciple's mistakes then that
implies that he is not a Guru. I am not harsh but if you
commit a mistake then don't expect me not to punish you.
Guru Kumhar Shishya Kumbh Hai, Gadh Gadhi Kkadhe Khot.
Antar Hath Samhar De, Bahar Marai Chot.
The bring change within you is not an ordinary thing.
When you are not able to complete a work then a power
shoulders you, reminds you of its presence.
I have said- Jo Vastu Mere Paas Hai, Wo Kahin Nahin Hai.
I can prove it. A complete Guru changes you and
enlightens you with the spiritual vision. When the tenth


Changing the world spiritually 91
door opens, then you witness moon and stars (Heavens)
whereas when the eleventh door opens you witness Mind.
When you have spiritual sight, you can see lust and
anger arise. Otherwise, you can do years of meditation and
still you would not be able to have control over Mind. It
has been tried by Kapil muni, Parashar muni but they were
still not able to control mind. Therefore,
Naam Hoye To Math Namave,Na To Yeh Man Bandh Nachave.
When a complete Guru sows the power in you, then
you are able to see the internal mechanism, you are able to
see through inner enemies and will have control over
activities of the Mind.
That's why I say repeatedly "The Thing I possess
cannot be found in this universe" listening to this
statement, somebody asked me, that if I have the power
then to prove it. I replied that thing is not energy, pay
attention to words.
Similarly, a shopkeeper says that the pepper in my shop
can't be found anywhere else and tells about its originating
places. So the thing which is the topic of discussion does
not belong to this world, it is not be found in these three
worlds (Earth, Heaven and hell). It is from fourth eternal
world, Amarlok. When you possess that thing, all three
things come to you. I have experienced this not once or
twice but million times. There is no doubt in this, it is
guaranteed. When I give Naam to any one (any Class,
color, creed, caste, race, sects and Religions), three things
are assured-

1. Soul and Mind are separated from each other.
2. The attraction of the world disappears.
3. There will be complete security.
   The outcome is in front of you. Every Naami (Initiate)
   changes after getting Naam Diksha. Other human are
   dancing on the waves of mind. Mind is very effective but it
   has no control over my Naami. After getting Naam, his
   Soul awakens. If we compare with the Naamis from other


92 Sahib Bandgi
communities (Gurus), they have no control over
themselves unlike my Naamis, they get no spiritual
benefits. My Naamis find themselves to be different from
others, they find other people Ignorant, one moment they
are in good mood and in another they are in despondent
and behave madly. All these are because of the powerful
grip of the Mind over them.
My Naami gets hold over their mind. During the time
of Naam Dhan, I separate the Soul from Mind. I separate
them, then you are able to understand Mind’s influence.
This work is most difficult in this world which cannot be
accomplished by everyone. When you begin to understand
Mind, the world fades away and attraction dies out. Then,
every Naami feels that there is a protective force
accompanying him all the time and everywhere. They will
have the realization and nature of that protector. The truth
is that, the thing I possess does not exist anywhere in this
universe. This thing frees the grip of the world of mind
and you are able to understand the nature of Soul.
Why do you concentrate? Towards what end? To
enquire ‘who am I’? Satguru separates the Mind and Soul.
This work can't be accomplished with self-effort but only
through Grace of Satguru (Krupa Marg-Path of Grace).
Mind has entangled you so much that you are not in a
position to see its works through the Soul. When Body says
that I am hungry, then Mind says that this is my wish. Soul
is trailing mind, wandering in its wishes and imaginations.
All the deeds committed by the person are capable of more
entanglement. Even when someone tries to get out of this
web he is unable to do that. It is far too deep and extensive.
It will provide you with the money and positions and
miraculous powers but it will never let you realize your
Soul. Only a complete Guru is capable of giving that to
you.
The basic power of Mind is ignorance. Mind will create
various troubles and inflict difficulties to the Soul. Soul


Changing the world spiritually 93
will remain in its entanglement. Soul is unable to
understand it. One can engage crores of techniques but he
cannot not free himself from this storm, you can't breach
the boundary of Mind on your own.
Satguru shows you the true form of Soul. The beak of a
Hansa-Swan has wonderful features. He drinks milk. If
water is mixed within it then he would drink milk but
leaves the water in the bowl. This work can't be done by
anyone other than Hansa. Similarly we can notice the
power of the Satguru disengage the Mind and Soul.
Satguru does this work in a moment. Then Mind will be
unable to entangle the Soul. Like-
Doodh Ko Math Ghrit Nyara Kiya,
Palat Kar Phir Tahin Mein Nahin Samai.
When you have formed crust butter or curd from milk
you cannot convert it back into milk again. When complete
Guru disengages Soul from Mind, they cannot come
together ever again. This work can't be accomplished with
any other greater force or methods. But- Satguru Mor
Shoorma, Kaskar Mara Baan.
Naam Akela Reh Gaya, Paya Pad Nirman.
This work is accomplished in a moment. Then, a
protective power also accompanies you. That's why-
Jab Main Tha To Guru Nahin, Ab Guru Hai Mai Nahin.
Prem Gali Ati Sankari, Tamein Do Na Samahin.
The delusion is due to your feeling of 'I' consciousness,
that creates desires. This belief vanishes all the way. Why?
Guru Samana Shiahya Mein, Shishya Liya Kar Neh.
Bilgaye Bilge Nahin, Ek Roop Do Deh.
Guru aligns you with himself. You forget about the
world. The words of Sahib are heavy-
Naam Paye Satya Jo Bira,Sang Rahun Main Das Kabira.
I am repeating myself again and again, “When I leave
this world, many will regret because truth is that the thing I
possess does not exist anywhere in this universe.


94 Sahib Bandgi

## 7. On the day of Naam Initiation.

When you come to receive Naam-Dhan, know that, you
are being reborn. Forget all the sins committed till to date
because then you weren't aware of things, you didn't had
any sense of right and wrong. All those are results of the
impurity of the Mind which are the causes of those sins.
Well, now you won't be ignorant anymore. You can sense
sin and virtue therefore will not commit wrong deeds. You
will be given seven rules to follow which you have to
follow with determination. You are provided with power of
Naam, hence not to worry. If you go towards a wrong path,
this power will stop you, warn you, and therefore never
ignore it. If you are still commit wrong for which you were
warned then you will not be forgiven. You will be
punished. Be truthful, don't eat meat, don't take intoxicants
and such drugs, have a virtuous character-one wife, earn by
honest means, and never steal or gamble. (Mantra Moolam
Guru Vakyam) (For Initiation, should be at least 3 months
after stopping Non Veg food and Alcohol).
You will be instructed on these rules first. You are
coming to get Naam-Daan with faith, therefore you should
not place your trust on other places or Path, because the
one who have faith in all, doesn't have faith in anyone.
Thus, he is an agnostic. Therefore come with complete
trust. If you wear any rings concerning the stars, the
threads promising bright future, medallions etc., you
should remove them before coming for Naam Dhan. Come
with a complete determination. No rebirth on this earth,
you have come to the right place.
Ek Naam Ko Jankar Dooja Dei Bahaye.
Know this that you are going to a better place.
I have said repeatedly that ‘The thing I possess is not
found in this Universe’. This is not accepted by the
intelligentsia at first. Have faith. All this talk is not in vain.
However, I have never said that I am Sahib-Supreme Lord


Changing the world spiritually 95
and yet, I am doing everything. I have said it on account of
Sahib. The world is frightened. Well, Sahib is right now
walking along with a veil. One day that veil will vanish
and everyone will be absorbed into Sahib. You have been
told to forget everything that is your past. There is a secret
behind it.
I will ask for a thing from you at the time of Naam-
Dhan, that is your trust in me. Do you have faith? You will
say - yes. Naam will be granted to you on the basis of this
trust. Remember, your permanent Salvation is based on the
strength of this faith. Therefore, keep your complete faith
in me.
Guru Ko Akhand Brahm Kar Mane,
Guru Ko Nahin Manush Kar Jane.
Then, I have to take your Body, Mind and wealth from
you. I will ask you to give me those from the depth of your
heart and with eyes closed. Do you know why I would take
that? Because those three are the weeds on the Soul. Soul
has taken them has its own, and makes claim, mine! Mine!
By mistake. Therefore,
Tan Man Diya To Bhal Kiya, Sir Ka Jasi Bhar.
Jo Kachhu Kahe So Main Diya, Bahut Sahe Shir Mar.
You will surrender those things with a clear and true
heart. If you aren't given with a pure heart then remember
that even I have not given you any. After I receive all these
three things, I will return your Body to you and I will ask
you to take care of your parents and children with that
body. Never do anything wrong, with that body, by
thinking of it as yours. Similarly, I will return your wealth
to you and I will ask you never to cheat any one or do
wrong deeds with it. However, do not expect that I will
return your Mind to you, it will stay with me.
After that, placing my hand on your head, I will chant
in your ear and in that moment I will separate your Soul
from your Mind and focus it on 'Agyachakra'(with
Soundless Satya Naam through Paras Surti- Moksh


96 Sahib Bandgi
Moolam Guru Krupa). I will return your Soul to you after
possessing it (Mind cannot know this Naam). The Grace
that you will get after that will never vanish. Sahib will
stand beside you in the form of Satya Naam.
Naam Paye Satya Jo Bira, Sang Rahun Main Das Kabira.
Now, understand that you are born again-new birth
here. Then you will be made to understand both Naam and
Mantras. You will even be shown how to do Dhyan-
Meditation (Dhyan Moolam Guru Roopam) and the way to
achieve Concentration.
After getting Naam-Dhan, at the start recite the Guru-
mantra for 4-5 minutes (worship of Satguru), means
remember, call your Guru first. Practice bhajan at dusk and
dawn in reverse Breathing (Start with Manthra in breath for
concentration). You should do it during meals, sleeping
and on wakening with reverse breath (swasake Maala).
Now recite the Naam given to you with the flow of your
breaths and focus it at one and a quarter hand over your
head (2 feet high over the head- Astadhal Kamal-Guru
Stan). You need to do it the way you are told – Surati Yog
with Soul. Don't be confused whether the Satya Naam
given to you, that will remain with you. Just like electricity
passes through the wires, same way the spiritual rays will
enter you through it. The Sar Naam given to you cannot be
spoken or heard, Sar Naam- soundless sound, will be
always be with you.
'Sar Naam Satyapurush Kahaya.'
It itself is Param Purush who works beside you. You
should recite Naam (in Breath) do not give in to confusion,
Mantra for Dhyan will help in concentration-Surati-Yog.
You can sit anytime you want, however midnight time is
the best, you will be able to find me at that time (on 8th
Chakra-Guru staan).
Dekha Dekhi Sab Kahein, Bhor Bhaye Guru Naam.
Ardhraat Ko Jagsi, Khanjad Gulam.


Changing the world spiritually 97
Satguru will accompany you all the time for the initial
six months. If you grasp him you are succeeded, however
if you are unable to do during that time then it would be
difficult later. Therefore try concentrate with pure faith and
complete determination. If you forget about the Naam
(Guru Mantra) or the chant then you can ask other Naamis.
But remember not to ask your wife or husband. If you
asked her, then your relation will be converted in that of
siblings. You shouldn't provide Naam in front of a person
who is not a Naami because if you do there would be
unfavorable consequences. You can clarify anything from
a Naami. If there is a trouble in the internal world then you
can ask me, I am available every time.

Note:
 At Naam Initiation, enter with an attitude of surrender, be simple,
reverential and attentive, it may take up to an hour.
 It is customary: to bring a simple Mala for blessing, which is
worn to identify as Naami (It is not used for chanting, Chanting is
done with reverse breath- to improve concentration), be attentive
while meditation lesson is given by Satguru.
 When you offer salutation, (Bandgi) make sure you touch the
feet of Guru with your palm, and have eye to eye contact with Him
and receive his rays. No need to bow your head while doing
Bandgi-Salutation. Make offerings (Guru Dhaksna) at the feet of
Guru with love (No flowers), clarify your doubts, be courteous
make it short and simple, save time.
 Karmas of all your lives are cleared, therefore follow the seven
rules, for you will have no rebirth to reap, which can make
remaining life harder otherwise.
 Rise above the Religions and its rituals, (Do not Disrespect
them, and keep away). Spirituality is about Spirit -Soul and its goal
is Salvation, whereas, Religions and divinity is about Mind and
Matter. Meditate on Satguru with complete faith, rest is his grace.
 Present your contact details before you leave, to the volunteers.
Offer your service to Satguru.


98 Sahib Bandgi

## 8 What Is Our Path.

'Sahib' is referred to Param Purush and 'Bandgi’, is the
synonyms of greetings. Therefore, ‘Sahib Bandgi’ means
Salutation to the Param Purush (Truth-The Supreme Lord
of Amarlok, 4th world). Sahib Bandgi is not any Kabir
Pant, not even Sant Matt, because before taking Naam
Diksh from Sant Kabir Sahib all were doing devotion to
only Kal Purush, therefore the words of such persons
includes the subject of Kal Purush. Reading such books a
person gets deluded. Even for clarifications there are no
such Mahatmas who can present Satya Bhakti exclusively
off all other forms of devotion. We are not Kabir Panti, at
present whatever Kabir Pants exists, they are not treading
the path shown by Kabir Sahib, and they have forgotten his
Ideology. Kal Purush deceives all. There are some who
asks us to take Diksha-Initiation from them and take Kabir
Sahib as Guru. Sant Kabir Sahib never asked people to be
devoted to him while he was leaving. He asked people to
be devoted to Satguru.
Preet Bahut Sansar Mein, Nana Vidhi Ki Hoye.
Uttam Preeti So Janiye, Satguru Se Jo Hoye.
There are many kinds of love in the world but the true
love is that which one has for the Satguru. All other kinds
of love are polluted as well as mortal but the love for a
Satguru is the best of all. It is not limited to this world
alone. It extends beyond the limits of the world and is
related to the 4th World. Thus it is never ending and is
the only medium for realizing Param Purush.
Kahain Kabir Koyi Ubrey, Le Satguru Ki Oat.
Kabir Sahib says that only he who seeks the shelter of
real Satguru can escape. None can grant Param Moksh.
"Hai Yaha Satguru Bina Koi, Moksha Ka Dhata Nahi|"
In truth I have no need to take words of Kabir
Sahib, however I am under compulsion to give
reference from Kabir Sahib as an example. I speak with


Changing the world spiritually 99
my experience and as a witness. Others have corrupted
the words of Kabir Sahib and presenting them with their
own deliberations. Therefore even if you read the Books on
Kabir Sahib you are in for confusion, because, the purity is
lost. I am presenting pure Adyatmic-Spiritual wisdom
before you. Therefore instead of letting you around the
knowledge of Sant and Kabir Sahib, I keep you around
myself. (Krupa)
A man asked me that if I am not aligned with any
Dharmas-Religions or other organizations, than what it is
that, I am presenting? I have told him that it will take a
long time to understand this philosophy. If you want to
teach Islam, give Koran, he will understand. For imparting
Hindu religion, there are Tri Devs to narrate about. For
Christianity give the massages of Christ. However to make
any one understand Sahib Bandgi, you have to struggle,
therefore you get disturbed. I have made you understand, it
is not enough?
All those Rishis and Munis who came, spoke on the
devotion to Kal Purush only. We are not giving the
examples of Rishis and Munis because they only spoke
about Kal Purush. Our Philosophy is such that a small
Boy sings rooming 'Mujay Apney Hi Rang Mey Rangda
Phirey, Sahib Apney Hi Rang Mey Rangda Phirey||' What
he is saying that we do not follow any one, he is right in
saying that. We do not base on the Philosophy of Meera
Bhai, because she was a Sagun worshipper, who sang on
the aspect with form, latter when she took Naam Diksha
from Ravi Dass Ji, she embraced Satya Bhakti. If one
reads her earlier devotion, then they will say that it is all
the same. We make the inner meanings clear. Paltu Sahib
also was following Niranjans devotion earlier. In the
beginning Gurunanak Ji himself was observing the
Omkar upasana, latter took Naam from Sahib, and then
he spoke about that beyond the 10 door (Sarashrasar).
We do not deny any one, nor do we ask anyone to follow


100 Sahib Bandgi
that. However those who say that we do not follow any
one, they are right. I am not asking one to follow Kabir
Sahib's philosophy, with time many have corrupted his
words, no clarity exists, people gets deluded. All have
mixed up their own views in the middle of Sahib's words
and written books as per their confounded convictions.
Therefore what I bring to you is pure, Satya Bhakti.
A woman asked me to convey to Param Purush, that
she should be redeemed from her difficulties. I wish to ask
what, is she not in a plot. One said that when she sits on
meditation, Guru or sometimes Kabir Sahib appears. I
asked her as to why is she standing on three boats. Lack of
concentration on one lead to such diversion.
What have you got to do with my Guru? What do you
want from Kabir Sahib? You need to deal with me, me
alone. 'Mujey Hey Kaam Satguru Se...' That Kabir Sahib did
not indicate his feet, he left all problems to Satguru.
Guru Manush Kar Mantey, Charamrut Ko Paan|
Te Nar Narkey Jayenge, Janam Janam Hoy Swaan||
My Gurudev told my fellow disciples to take me as
Satguru after he leaves. He told that he is withdrawing in to
his self. Therefore we are on the path of Satguru Ideology
(Brunga Matt).
Guru Aagya Le Aavahi, Guru Aagya Le Jaahi|
Kahe Kabir Ta Daas Ko, Teen Lok Darr Naahi||
Listen to what we say; understand this, Satguru gives
the power with which we can be liberated. I do not talk
about earning through meritorious deeds. I do not ask for
service either.
Just like the farmer seeding, in which major work is
done by him. He refreshes the soil, manures it, and gives
water frequently. Similarly it has to be taken care off. I
have given that which needs to be given, now follow it
with Satsang to keep yourself safe from distractions. Yes
as an Individual, I am not overtaking Sant Kabir Sahib.
However, I am not following others philosophy. I have


Changing the world spiritually 101
prohibited baying the books available from others, still
some did buy quietly. There is lot of mix up in Ideologies
written in those books by others. Someone is written that
Kabir has told that Atma is ever thing, there is no reference
on Satlok.
Therefore I am giving you a pure thing. Mother gives
birth to a child, then feeds, educates, and with a loving care
brings him up. My work did not end with gracing Naam
Dhaan. Mothers care is needed, therefore I am always on
the move giving Satsang, and every day about 5 Satsangs
are arranged. I also give Naam Diksha. Therefore our
Philosophy is Satguru Bhakti-Devotion to Living
Satguru. (Bringa Matt).
Those who talk about Satlok, even here, there are flaws.
They read it out of Book. If someone says that Jammu city
is at sea shore, how will a person living in Jammu city will
react? Will they agree, in the same way I also come to
know? Whenever I wish, I can go around the Heavens, I
keep moving among the universes. Then why am I here.
(As instructed by my Guru Dev I have to reach out to the
people, establish Ashrams give Satsang and Naam Dhaan).
However, the truth is that I do not wish to come out of my
Self.
Gurushabd Nischay Satya Maney, Brungi Matt Tab Pavai|
Taji Sakal Aasa Shabd Baasa, Kaaga Hansa Kahavai||
Our Matt is different; Bringa Matt. What is Bringa
Matt? All other jivas give birth from womb, but bringa (A
type of Wasp) does not do this way. There are 27 Lakhs,
kinds of Insects; Bringa is unique among them. They have
only male form, they have no mother. How do they
procreate? It creates a Mud House. There is a miraculous
effect in his sound. It flies very fast. They catch hold of
any Larvae of insect, keeps the Larva in the mud house and
transmits its sound; its sound is very endearing. With this
sound, it transforms the Larvae into another Brunga, like


102 Sahib Bandgi
itself. It makes it in a moment like itself. This way I also
remold you like my own being.
Satguru takes the total responsibility. Your attachment
and desires will keep reducing; your inner vices will begin
to disappear. A security guard (Satguru) will stand by you
always. 'Mera Hari Mauko Bhajey, Mey Sou Pauv
Pasaar||' this is Sahaj Marg. You need not do any Sadhna.
This is Brunga matta.
Guru Ko Kijey Dandavaat, Koti Koti Pranaam|
Kitt Na Janey Brunga Ko, Kariley Aap Saman||
Therefore whatever examples given are from words of
Sahib. Others philosophy has defects, pitfalls and
corruptions.
Dharma das Ji was devoted to Takur Das-Krishn Ji. He
told Sahib that there is one Paramatma who is Takur Ji.
Kabir Sahib brought him in to proper understanding.
Teen Lok Jo Kaal Satavey| Taako Sab Jagh Dhyaan Lagavey||
Nirakaar Jehi Vedh Bakhani| Soi Kaal Koi Maram Na Janey||
Trigun Jaal Yah Jag Phadana| Gahey Na Avichal Purush

He said that all are devoted to Kal Purush. To whom
the world is worshiping as Lord, he himself eats them up at
the end. His children are the Tri Devs.
Sabey Jiv Satpurush Ke Aahi|

Anthkaal Puni Karey Nivaasa||
He says that all are the Souls from Param Purush.
However, Niranjan deceptively trapped and entangled
them. First he himself takes the form of a Demon and


Changing the world spiritually 103
trebles the beings, then he comes as an Avatar and destroys
the demons. Human being looking at such leelas takes him
as his protector, however at the end of time he only
disappoints them.
Sahib has not said a word in vain, but also gave the proof.
Dwapar Dekh Hu Krushna Ki Riti|
Dharmani Parikahu Nithi Anithi||
Arjun Kah Tinha Daya Drudava|
Daya Drudaay Puni Gaath Karava||
Gita Paat K Earth Batlaava|
Puni Pachey Bahu Paap Laghava||

Paando Kah Bahu Kaal Sathava||
Bheji Himalya Tehhi Galaye,Chal Anek Keenah Yamraye.
Bahu Ganjan Kahan Denha, Tako Kahe Mukti Hari Denha.
It can be seen that in Dwapar Yuga, Krishna ji taught
Arjun the summary of Gita and after that made him attack
his own foes.
Sahib told Dharamdas that whoever you worship, they
all have faults. Now I have to warn others of these faults
but the people are thinking of it as decrying. It needs to be
told that all these are within the limit of devotion of Kal
Purush, and therefore one should to rise above it.
After the war he told Arjun that 'you have committed a
sin’. Arjun became stunned and argued that you were the
one to tell me do that. Then Krishna ji replied that was
politics, you have killed your foes that is a sin according to
religion-Dharma.
If I tell Mohanlal to kill someone and then he will
refuse to do that saying that it is sinful. But if he is order to
do the killing and complete the task as per my wish, and
after committing the deed if I tell him that he has
committed a sin then it would be contradicting isn't it. My
words never contradict each other.
Then a yagya was carried out, even then the burden
wasn't lifted off. Then they were told to go to Himalaya.
They had to suffer extreme cold. Even then they couldn’t


104 Sahib Bandgi
get that sin off and in the end they had to suffer through
hell. So is this decrying. No, everyone is aware of this.
Only Kabir Sahib has made you understand this with the
illustrations and facts as you need to move forward for
your freedom. "Bahu Gunjan Jeevan Kahan Keenha, Tako
Kahe Mukti Hari Deenha.What type of freedom was this?
Sahib tells Dharamdas-
Bali te so chhal keenah bahuta,
Punya nasaye keenah ajguta.
Chhal budhhi deenhe patala,
Koi na lakhai prapanchi kala.
Laghu surup hoye pratham dekhaye,
Prithivi leenah puni swasti karai tabai pragtana,
Deergh roop dekhi bali bhaye mana.
Tini parag teenau pur bhayau,
Adha panv nrip dan na diyau.
Dehu puraye nrip adha paun,
To nahin tav punya prabhav nasaun.
Tehi karan patalahin deenha,
Andha jeev jal pragat na cheenha.
Tab lai peeth napaye tehi deenha,
Hari le tahi patalai keenha.
Yahi char jeev dekhi nahin cheenha,
Ahai mukti hari humko deenha.
What was the mistake of Maha Bali? Sahib is making
you understand with logic and telling us to understand
mukti. What type of freedom or mukti are we desiring at
the end, I am helping all to understand this part, and he
doesn't have conflict with any other things. So in Dwarp
form he asked for three and half foot earth from King Bali
and after that he increased his size and measured three loks
in three steps. When the half foot remained and King Bali
was unable to offer any more earth then he was seeking
heavens but was sent to the Lower world-Patal. Sahib says
that blind human doesn't understand this. It is crystal clear
but still there is veil on human Mind. After all this, it is


Changing the world spiritually 105
said that he has been freed by Hari. He was sent to the
Patal. Was this mukti?
People are twisting the words of sahib-
To Ram Sumar Pachtayega.
We are saying- Truth
Tu Nam Sumar Pachtayega.
We are giving you a pure entity. If we are providing
you with crust butter then it is a pure one, it doesn’t
contains lassi. We are giving you True Devotion (Satya
Bhakti) which is different from others. The others are
providing you with the devotion which is laced with Kaal.
All the other panth or communities are worshipping Kal
Purush. Some are talking like us. They are talking about
Satpurush, Sach khand and Amar lok but in reality they are
worshiping the Kal Purush. Because these things are
written, they are just reading them. Nevertheless, they don't
have anything that belong to them (Experience). They are
empty from inside. We are different from other panths on
five reasons. They are-

Amar lok - That is beyond the three Worlds.
Teen Lok Se Bhin Pasara, Amar Lok Satguru Ka Nyara.
Teen Lok Pralaye Karai, Chautha Lok Amar Hai Bhai.
First of all we are talking about the Amar lok which is
beside the three worlds. Kabir Sahib had given the message
of Amar lok initially. He talked about this incredible 4th
world which was not known to anyone. Just like scientists
who are curious by nature and exploring the universe. They
are revealing new informations every day. Similarly, Sahib
gave a new thing to this world. He talked about an
incredible eternal world free from dissolution, which never
ends. These three loks are in the limit of destruction means
they have certain period of time, Virat Paralaya. Just like
our body lives for a certain period of time, similar to others
things has a life time expiry period. Our body remains alive
for that particular time span and after that it dies. Similarly,


106 Sahib Bandgi
everything has a limit but our Soul is eternal in any place,
time and condition. It never dies. The thing which is
formed is bound to be destroyed but the Soul is not made
therefore it can't be destroyed.. Think here. If Soul can
never die then its residence should be such a place which
also eternal world, this is the truth. Because- 'Satya Soi
Jo Vinnshe Nahin'.
These three loks belong to Kaal. He has bound this Soul
in the cage of a body. The lok beside these three loks is the
one which is the residence of Param Purush. Sants have
called him Sahib. Paramatma is the name that Kal Purush
has taken for himself. Guru Nanak Dev ji says-
Ath Ata Ki Atari Majhara, Dekha Purush Nyara.
Nirakar Akar Na Jyoti, Nahin Veh Ved Vichara.
Onkar Karta Nahin Koi, Nahin Vahan Kal Pasara.
Vo Sahib Sab Sant Pukara, Aur Pakhand Hai Sara.
Satguru Cheenah Deenah Yeh Marag, Nanak Najar Nihara.
We all talk about Mufti but we don't know why we
desire Mufti, no one knows. In reality the world where we
live is the one which belongs to Kal-Purush. Here the Soul
is being tortured again and again. Kal-Purush is hurting the
beings. Hence, we all desire to free ourselves from the
hands of the Kal-Purush. But the problem is that we don't
have any knowledge or understanding about the extent of
these three worlds and that all these are under Kal Purush.
After this world we want to avoid hell and like to attain the
Brahma lok, or higher heaven. We don't have any
knowledge of world beyond these. We don't know the
correct destination of the Soul. Subconsciously, we are
searching for Sahib but due to lack of knowledge on this
truth we have labelled Kal-Purush as the Paramatma. The
one who burdens and hurting us is taken as our best friend
by mistake. That’s why Sahib says-
Jo Rakshak Tahan Chihnat Nahin,
Jo Bhakshak Tahan Dhyan Lagahin.
These three loks of Kal-Purush are made up of the five
tatvas-elements. These five tatvas have a limit. According


Changing the world spiritually 107
to Shashtras also, at the end of the world these five tatvas
also destroyed. This has scientific proof and it is also
mentioned by Dayanand Saraswati Ji.
Will these three worlds which comprises of Heaven,
ancestral world, Brahma lok and several others will vanish
too? Yes, all of them will vanish so, this can't be the basis
for faith. Hence, Sants have labelled this world as false and
dying one. There is nothing truth in this because everything
ends. This endless universe (Expanding) is divided into
three parts by the Sants- Shunya Void space, Mahashunya-
Great Void Space and Amar lok-Eternal World. Shunya
and Mahashunya are both destructive but shunya is that
place where there are planets and satellites and
mahashunya comprises of Nirgun world. There are no
articles. Means if there are stars, moon, sun, planets etc.
then that place is the Shunya. This is the limit of Shunya.
Then the above it is the Mahashunya. Mahashunya doesn't
consist any of this. That is Nirgun place. There are seven
skies in mahashunya. These seven skies are reverted as
seven Surati. These skies are huge. They contain several
magnetic attractions. They provide out of the world
pleasure. These are so huge that the crores of universes like
Shunya can fit into it.
Firstly, five Asankhya yojan above Shunya, there
comes he Achint lok (worryless world). Then three
Asankhya yojan above Achint lok there is Sohang lok.
Above that lok i.e. for five Asankhya yojan above there is
base-Mool Surti lok. It is the origin of awakening- of
Atma. Then three Asankhya yojan above there is Ankur
lok. Then there is the queue of Ichha lok, Vani lok from
where rhythms generate. In the end there is Sehaj lok.
These seven loks are also considered as seven skies. Till
Sehaj lok means seventh sky all are in the limit of
destruction.
Above all these loks means one Asankhya yojan above
Sehaj lok there is Amar lok. This is the place where there is


108 Sahib Bandgi
no destruction in contrast these three loks of Niranjan are
destructible.
Hence, Sahib has talked about this world in detail
which is eternal and true, which is beyond three worlds and
outside the seven skis and is free from dissolutions. If Soul
is eternal then its destination surely is the eternal world-
Amar lok.
Chal Hansa Tu Desh Hamare, Sahib Det Pukara Hai.
Satya To Keval Amar Lok Hai, Jhootha Sab Sansara Hai.
Sahib has urged humen, to prepare for leaving this
world and head towards your own world. This is not the
world of Soul. Sahib cautions again and again.
Chalna To Hai Door Musafir Kahe Sove Re.
This Soul has come from very far. This is not its own
world. If it is so then Kabir Sahib would not have said
those things.
Chal Hansa Satlok Hamare, Chhodo Yeh Sansara Ho.
Yahi Sansar Kaal Hai Raja, Karm Ka Jal Pasasr Ho.
Chudah Khand Base Vake Mukh Me,Sabhi Ko Karat Ahara ho.
Barbar Koyla Kar Daran, Phir Phir De Avtara Ho.
Brahma Vishnu Shivnat Dhariya, Aur Ko Kaun Vichara Ho.
Sun Nar Muni Sab Chhalchhal Marle, Churasi Me Dara Ho.
Madhya Akash Aap Jahan Baithe, Jyoti Shabd Thahiyara Ho.
Tako Roop Kahan Lag Barno, Anant Bhanu Ujiyara Ho.
Shwet Swaroop Shabd Jahan Phoole, Hansa Karat Bihara Ho.
Kotin Chand Surya Chhipi Jaihain, Ek Rom Ujiyara Ho.
Vahi Paar Ik Nagar Basat Hai, Barsat Amrit Dhara Ho.
Kahain Kabir Suno Haramdasa, akho Purush Darbara Ho.
He is telling the Hansa-soul to leave this world and
attain the Satyalok. This is the world of Kal-Purush where
there is a web of deeds all around. Here the condition of
being is not at all right. Even the trinity Gods here has
physical forms. He is confusing every muni and beings by
entangling them in the web of chaurasi (8.4 million
species). He himself is situated in the sky in the form of
Mass of light. But beyond this there is a nation. There is
the light equivalent of crores of Suns. There is the flow of


Changing the world spiritually 109
Amrit-naktar there. There crores of suns and moons feel
unworthy in front of such light from a single pore.
Dharamdas! Look into it.
This world belongs to the Kal-Purush. There is nothing
for the benefit of the Soul. It’s only hurting here. People
talk about the glory of the incarnations but Sahib says that
hey also come into the similar extent. Whatever that
resides in these three loks is within the limits of kaal.
Yeh Hardo Yahan Kaal Purush Ke Hai Hijare,
Har Simt Va Har Jaye Me Yam Jal Pisare.
Yak Lok Va Yak Ved Do Dariya Ke Kinare,
Saiyaad Ke Kabu Me Hain Sab Jeev Bechare.
Chalti Hai Yahan Teg Va Talvar Do Dhare.
Chal Hans Aachal Molido Mavaye Hamare.
He is saying that everything here belongs to kaal. At
every nook there is his network. Every person in this world
is in his painful clutches. Therefore, Hansa-swan! You
should come with us. Furthermore-
Jab Bhool Gaya Adam Ko Aphi Apa,
Pavand Huva Tifli Javani Va Budhapa.
Sabpar Hai Laga Malik Maut Moh Va Chhapa,
Hai Aag Lagi Besh Jalega Yehyeh Sarapa..
Jalte Hain Dhol Udte Dhuven Dhar Shareere,
Chal Hans Achal Molido Mavaye Hamare.
He is saying that there is the fear of death here. There is
the fire of lust, anger, hate, greed and fire of Desire which
is burning everything in its wake. Therefore the call to
leave this burning world and come to the other world.
Afsos Liya Loot Dharam Dharman Dhurat,
Ek Ishq Jad Bhai Hai Husn Hai Aurat.
Har Kaun Kiya Bhaun Hai Yeh Mohini Surat.
Dil Par Huva Par Bamah Paraye Surat.
Bajar Hade Mar Va Bimar Najare.
Chal Hans Achal Moli Do Mavaye Hamare.
Here the righteousness-Dharma of the Soul has been
looted. Here there are beautiful woman made for spreading
the disease of physical love. Everyone is being infatuated


110 Sahib Bandgi
by her. Everyone is down with this disease. Therefore
Hansas! Leave this world, and come to our nation.
Kailas Chalega Va Jinu Lok Chalega,
Amravati Alkavati Golok Chalega.
Sab Swarg Chalega Va Tapolok Chalega.
Jo Had Jano Mard Me So Lok Chalega.
Vo Bhi Jal Jave Jahan Naulakh Sitare,
Chal Hans Achal Molido Mavaye Hamare.
Whatever you are seeing here will one day vanishes.
Even heaven will not remain standing. The stars will not
remain forever. So Hansas! Leave this perishable world
and head to the Amar Dham.
Koi Na Rahe Ek Purush Lok Rahega,
Aave Jo Vahan Se So Khabar Uski Ahega.
Sab Kaul Kar Sham Ajile Sol Bahega,
Jisko Veh Najar Aave So Phir Kachhu Na Chahega.
Nischal So Rahe Kayak Jahan Amritdhare,
Chal Hans Achal Moli Do Mavaye Hamare.
The one thing that is going to remain forever is the
Amarlok of Param Purush. Anything else will perish. The
one who arrives from there (Sant, Satguru-Paramhans) can
be the only one who can speak of that world. Those who
will witness it will not have desire for anything else.
Therefore Hansas! You head towards that world.
Hanso Ki Husn Khubi Kahi Jaye So Kaise,
Yeh Natik Gum Sum Bayan Kijiye Aise.
Ek Muye Munauvir Keh Is Nurka Jaise,
Chhip Jaye Karodo Mahehur Talat Taise.
Sab Hans Purush Rooppurush Unko Dulare,
Chal Hans Achal Molido Mavaye Hamare.
The beauty of the Hansa there can't be described in
words. Even the crores of Suns and Moon fade in front of
that light. Param Purush loves all those Hansas-Souls.
Therefore, head towards there.
Jahan Raat Na Din Hai Va Nahin Suraj Chanda,
Sohang Durai Chanvar Kare Purush Ananda.
Yak Murat Sare Na Khudavand Na Banda,
Is Manjil Najdik Nahin Kal Ka Fanda.


Changing the world spiritually 111
Jis Lok Hamesha Ko Paramhans Padhare,
Chal Hans Achal Moli Do Mavaye Hamare.
There is no night, no day, no moon, no God and no
relatives. Everything is his form. The world which is the
destination of Paramhans (Satguru), head towards that
world.
Satguru Ki Sharan Leke Chalo Behke Us Par,
Veh Kadir Mutlak Huva Jis Jeev Ka Madagar.
Kar Pal Me Subuk Dosh Utha Usa Garan Bar,
Pahunchave Vatan Me Na Butan Me Hove Autar.
Ajij Se Gunahgar Kataro Ko Jo Tare,
Chal Hans Achal Molido Mavaye Hamare.
He is urging the Hansas to surrender at the feet of
Satguru because he is the true savior of the beings. He will
send you there in a moment. He will clear all your
shortcomings. Therefore go to that world like the shadow
of the Satguru.
Kal-Purush has entangled all in the troubled network of
families and relations. He has entangled beings is in the
clutches of desire, lust, greed, pride, hate and anger etc.
therefore Sahib cautions-
Khalak Hai Rain Ka Sapna, Samajh Dil Koi Nahin Apna.
Kahin Hai Lobh Ki Dhara, Baha Jag Jat Hai Sara.
Ghada Jyon Neer Ka Futa, Paar Jaise Dar Se Tuta.
Aisi Nirjan Jindgani, Ajaun Kyon Na Chet Abhimani.
Sajan Parvar Sutdara, Sabhi Us Roj Ho Nyara.
Nikal Jab Pran Javenge, Koi Nahin Kam Avage.
Nirak Mat Bhul Tan Gora, Jagat Me Jeevna Thora.
Sada Jin Jan Yeh Dehi, Lagao Satnam Se Nehi.
Kate Yam Kal Ki Fansi, Kahein Kabir Avinashi.
He is saying that this world is like the night dream.
Nobody is yours. All are immersed in the flow of illusion.
This life will end in a day just like a pitcher breaks or
leaves falling from the branch. So one of faith beware.
Friends, relatives, son, wife etc. nobody is yours. They will
be left behind one day. When your life will be out of your
body then they means nothing to you. They cannot help


112 Sahib Bandgi
you. You shouldn't doubt this, you fall for fair ones madly.
Life has a very short span. Therefore, stay out of
enticement, arrogance, desires, and cleverness and
concentrate on Satya Naam so that the hold of the Kal
Purush could break off. Sahib says repeatedly-
Hansa Sudhi Karo Apan Desh.Jahan Se Aayo Sudhi Bisrayo,
Chale Gayo Pardesh.Vahi Deshva Me Jote Na Bovai,
Moti Fira Hamesh.Vahi Deshva Me Mare Na Bigade,
Dukh Na Padat Kalesh.Chalo Hansa Baso Mansarovar,
Moti Chugo Hamesh.Kehat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho,
Ajar Amar Veh Desh.
This is beyond the understanding of the intelligent
scholar because it is much higher than the Shashtras and
Vedas. Intelligence or imagination can’t reach there. On
reaching there one never returns to this mortal world.
Tahanke Gaye Bahuri Na Ave,Aisa Desh Hamara Hai.
Avadhu Begam Desh Hamara Hai.Ved Kiteb Par Nahin Pavat,
Kehan Sunan Se Nyara Hai.Bin Badal Jahan Bijuri Chamke,
Bin Suraj Ujiyara Hai.Bina Seep Jahan Moti Upje,
Bin Mukh Bain Uchara Hai.Jyoti Lagaye Brahm Jahan Darshe,
Aage Agam Apara Hai.Kahin Kabir Tahan Rehni Hamari,
Bujhe Gurumukh Pyara Hai.

True Devotion-Satya Bhakti

Devotion beyond Sagun (With Form)-Nirgun
(Formless) and Para Bhakti
Bhakti Bhakti Sab Jagat Bakhani, Bhakti Bhed Koi Birle Jani.
Sanyasi Yogi Latdhai, Kari Bhakti Par Yukti Na Dhari.
What is this about this devotion? Some people are
worshiping Sagun- with Forms. We should not decry them
because the one who is a worshiper is better than a man
with no devotion. He will be full of love, that's why it’s not
bad, even sants have told you not to decry anyone.
There is not much importance to Guru in Nirgun and
Sagun devotion. The only work of the Guru is to direct his
pupil. The journey has to be carried out by thee pupil
himself. His reach depends on his own capacity. In this,


Changing the world spiritually 113
there is also not much importance to the Naam. This Naam
is also of world. That’s why the pupil is limited to this
universe only, he can't go beyond it. Sagun devotion helps
you obtain Samipya and Salokya salvation, whereas
Nirgun devotion helps to obtain Saropya and Sayujya
freedom.

Samipya Salvation- what is Samipya freedom/mukti?
Do good deeds, never hurt anyone, participate in shradhs
and if you worship your family deity for whole lifetime
then it is obtained easily. When the person dies there then
he goes to the ancestral world and lives there for thousand
years. There is no pain in that world like here. There are
pleasures there. There Soul resides in a subtle form. There,
when two friend meet there after death they will recognize
each other. This is mukti for 1000 years. What type of
mukti is this? Then after the fruits of your deeds, you still
come through the mother's womb again and again. What
type of mukti is this?

Salokya Salvation-similarly like in Samipya freedom,
in this also do good deeds, don't hurt anyone, fast and go
on pilgrimage, do all the deeds as written in the shashtras,
follow those instructions and devote yourself to a deity
then you will obtain this type of freedom. After death, the
devotee goes to the heaven. The being gets the fruit of his
deeds for lakhs of years and after that it again starts the
cycle in the mother's womb.
There are three types of heavens. One is Lower, then
Middle and the third at the Higher at top. The lowest one
contains pleasure but the middle one contains more
pleasure than that, but the highest one contains the most
amount of pleasure. There are many Dhams in heaven and
hell, they contain all the statues of deities which are
awaken. Whenever a worshipper queries, he obtains an
answer. That statue answers him. Copying them has


114 Sahib Bandgi
provided us with temples in this world. This is a
mysterious truth. Our ancestors who went there told their
experiences and created the imitations in this world so that
people get used to devotion, so they will desire to go there
too.
However, even this freedom is momentary. Even
shashtras mention that when you exhaust the fruits of your
deeds then you would have to come back into this world
again because heaven also comes under the dissolution of
three loks.
Saropya and sayujya Salvations- both are obtained by
yog. In saropya a being attains in the Brahma and in
sayujya, the being attains in the Nirakar. in this the being
does not take birth for crores of years but when the world
is destroyed and a new world is created then even those of
the Nirakar needs to take birth again. Think, is this mukti.
No. mukti is to get rid of this world forever, never to go
through a mother's womb again. What type of mukti is
this? That’s why-
Sant Na Mukti Chahate, Ahin Padarth Char.
Nahin Padarth Char, Mukti Santan Ki Cheri.
Every being in this world wants to be free. They are
trying to free themselves of this sorrow filled world. They
are resorting to the measures like holy baths, fast, Jap, tap
yog, Meditation and what not, we won’t know. But pity....
there is no getting rid of it. Kal is hurting everyone and
blocks them.
The main focus of devotion is to attain mukti but even
with it we are not free. Why? Sants believe that these
devotion are within the bounds of Kal's influence, this
devotion is not enough to reach the Mahanirvana state. So,
Is the Vedas and shashtras not talking about our welfare?
Of course they are. However, even they are talking about
limited Muktis. The Muktis about which they are talking
about is not related to the Soul because they can’t free our
Soul from mind. This has been affirmed by them also.


Changing the world spiritually 115
They believe that these four muktis are obtained by the
Karmas of the beings and these also decides their duration.
When their duration ends then the being needs to return to
this world. This means that even with all these muktis you
will falls in the cycle of rebirth.
The goal of Sagun devotion is to reach heaven, but even
in it there is rebirth. If one thinks that he will be able to get
rid of rebirth by Sagun then it won't happen. Nirgun
emphasis on yog. Then what is the aim of Nirgun? Is this
Bhakti wrong? No. we are not saying this. We are say that
with this rebirth cannot be avoided. ‘Phirke Dari De
Bhumahn, Bhoo Se Koi Nyara Nahin _’_. Rebirth will happen.
After the destruction, recreation lakhs and crores of beings
there will be return to this earth. This Nirgun bhakti is
revolving around five Mudras. These five Mudras are the
Nirgun worship. No other community or religions are
above formless-Nirgun Devotion.
If we observe closely then we will find that the people
today are not even aware of these five Mudras. Many
people come to me, I ask them to tell me if they have gone
internally to see the light, obtained siddhis then how did
you go there? Was it just a coincidence or by some
methods. No one could answer. There is the mention of
strings in the Sankhya yog. When you take a flight to
Europe then you would reach Europe, similarly, you would
reach that place of Mudra you meditate with. However, it's
a pity that there are very few who has knowledge about
these Mudras. When asked they didn't even have the
knowledge of Bhuchari.
There were six Maha Yogeshwar in times who had the
knowledge of these Mudras. Kabir Sahib has mentioned
them. The goal of Nirgun is Yog, earning of miraculous
powers and doing sadhna. If you gain something it will be
with effort. Merits and Guru has very little role to play
here. The Sant Matt talks about Guru. I tried to collect this
information from different Spiritual communities but there


116 Sahib Bandgi
wasn't any creditable information available, mere words.
There are many religious Institutions in India. We are not
at conflict with any, many talk on these five Mudras and
their Knowledge is from books and not from experience.
This is what I notice.
One is Physical – Stul yog which is even taught by the
physical education teachers in schools but the other one is
Subtile-Suksam yog which awakens the internal nerves
(Path of Papeel-Ant and Meen-Fish). Yog refers to coming
togather, to union. One can't breach the internal world with
external yog. Let’s see which Mudras can take us to the
internal world. This is accessible to all, but difficult task.
There are many people who are from different panths but
they are content even if they don't go in to the inner worlds.
The Nirgun devotees must also understand it clearly that it
will not provide them with Param Moksh, they will not be
free from this cycle of birth and death.
However, the devotion which has been mentioned by
the Kabir Sahib and Sants is the one in which this cycle of
birth and death breaks. Because with this true devotion,
Soul will achieve its true form and reach Amar lok to never
come back.
We have not understood the words of Sants clearly and
take all devotions as one and the same (to one God). No,
this is not the same thing. Many people want to go to
heaven but when asked that for how much duration they
will stay there, they don’t have any answer. It is mentioned
clearly in the shashtras that the being would come to the
heaven to take the fruits of their deeds and as soon as his
merits of deeds are over then they returns in this mortal
world again. He won't go away, he will wander within this
universe only. He won't be free. Is this why we acquired
the human body. It is said that many Divine beings search
for a Guru in this world. They desire the human body and
we want to go to Heavens even though we have the human
body.


Changing the world spiritually 117
After being entangled in Sagun and Nirgun, we struggle
to reach true devotion. Actually, this Sagun and Nirgun are
the sides of a same coin, but the Nirgun devotees doesn't
understand this completely. I once talked to a Nirgun
devotee and I asked him what the difference between
Sagun and Nirgun is? He replied that Sagun devotion
comprises of five tatvas and this five tatvas are destructible
whereas Nirgun devotion is beyond this. I asked him to
explain them to me and the process of destruction.
Nirgun devotee: water
Me: second
Nirgun devotee: fire
Me: fine, third
Nirgun devotee: air
Me: fourth
Nirgun devotee: earth
Me: so what is the fifth element?
Nirgun devotee: (creating a space between two hands) this
Me: what is this?
Nirgun devotee: Akash, Space
Me: what is this? Explain it.
Nirgun devotee: shunya
I said this is a pity that you are wandering as the
spokesperson for another pant. Who told you that sky-
Akash tatva is a word? No, it is not. The space between the
two hands is the Akash tatva, Stay there. You shouldn't slip
from your words.
Do Bin Hoye Na Adhar Avaja.
A sound cannot be created without the help of two.
With the connection of air and earth, sound is created. Who
told you that sound is Akash tatva?
What is the Akash tatva? Europeans are researching on
the topic of black matter. They are saying that it is the basis
of life. We are researching from where did it come from?
This is not a verbal duel. They are saying that 90%
universe is black matter and the remaining 10% is light.


118 Sahib Bandgi
They are right. Where ever the rays of Sun reach, there is
light and the remaining portion is enveloped with darkness.
Like you light a lamp then its light covers a certain area
only. Similarly, Sun's light reaches to a certain extent
only....they are saying that they are researching this. They
are wasting their time there, I can make them understand
this concept in two minutes.
This black matter is the element space, Akash tatva.
These five elements or tatva can be seen.
Peelo Rang Hai Dharti Ko, Meetho Isko Swad.
The color of earth is yellow and it tastes sweet.
Lal Rag Hai Agni Ko, Teekho Isko Swad.
Fire’s color is red and it is spicy-hot in taste.
Shwet Rang Hai Ja Ko, Kharo Isko Swad.
Water is said to be tasteless and colorless. This is
wrong. Sometimes water is said to be white. White is the
color of water.
Neelo Rang Hai Vayu Ko, Khatto Isko Swad.
The color of air is blue and its taste is sour. Sky is said
to be blue. This is the air element. It can't be seen from
closer inspection.
Kalo Rang Akash Ko,Phiko Isko Swad.
The color of the sky is black and its taste is very light.
....so I told him that if the fifth element is sky then that
brings the Nirgun devotee within the five elements, it also
becomes destructible.
Some people rise above Sagun devotion but they get
tangled in the Nirgun devotion. They think that Nirgun
devotion will provide them Param Moksh. Hence, Kabir
Sahib has elaborated all the devotions, cautioned everyone
and told that true devotion is beyond this.
Sagun Bhakti Kare Sansara, Nirgun Yogeshwar Anusara.
In Dono Ke Par Bataya, Mero Chit Eko Ahin Aya.
On Second devotion Nirgun, Dharamdas ji asks Sahib
that whole world is drowned in Sagun devotion and the
yogis are in Nirgun devotion but you are mentioning
devotion which is beyond them, I don't understand. All the


Changing the world spiritually 119
devotees from kalantar-eons have given the lessons of
Sagun and Nirgun. Therefore what is your massage? Dadu
ji said-
Koi Sagun Me Reejh Raha, Koi Nirgun Thehraye.
Atpat Chal Kabir Ki, Mose Kahi Na Jaye.
Actually, today people are taking Yog and Spirituality
as one and the same thing. In Subtle Yog, there is the
principle of awakening the minute inner cells, this
dependents on the five Mudras. It needs Brahmcharya-
celibacy.
Sagun is the external devotion, the devotion of 3. 3
Million deities. We do not contradict this. They prepare
you for devotion. If a child is send to Nursery Class then it
is being prepared for the next standard. So it’s like when
the person has no base, then he can be a Sagun worshiper.
Second is the Nirgun devotion. This is above the Sagun
Bhakti. This takes you to an inner world. That’s why
Nirgun devotees are focused on five Mudras. These are the
streams of the devotion. These are mentioned in the Hindu
religion.
We are not decrying the Sagun devotees. However, one
should do that in correct manner. Sins are prohibited there
also. If you are not following its rules and regulations then
this is also improper devotion. In the same way Nirgun
devotion is also a path. Those who come to us after leaving
them, then it’s an easy task for them.
Those who have been tutored in nursery are easy for the
teachers to handle in next standard. They understand better,
work to work it becomes better isn’t it.
One who understands his master is a smart servant.
Nirgun should be adopted by those who are celibate or
Sanyasi. It should be adopted by those who don't enjoy the
pleasure of senses.
_‘_ Jahan Bhog Tahan Yog Vinasha _’_.
Those who enjoy the pleasure of senses are prohibited
from the worship of five Mudras. Like an alcoholic can't go


120 Sahib Bandgi
in to wrestling. According to rule it is good, you need
stamina. Similarly, Brahmcharya is required in yog.
Because we need to control brain and maintain balance.
Grihi Hokar Kathai Gyan, Amli Hokar Dharai Dhyan.
Sadhu Hokar Kutai Bhag, Kahain Kabir Ye Teeno Thug.
Sahib says that one who is lost to his senses can't be a
Sadhu. If a person drowned in his house is talking about
knowledge, a drug addict is doing meditation and a Sadhu
is having intercourse then know that all of them are
phonies.
....therefore Khechari, Bhuchari etc. are the Mudras but
on what basis the people are engaged in that worshiping, it
is not known. There is age for exercise and yog.
Bhujangasan is not to be done by a small child or an aged
person of 70 years. There are different criteria. This is also
different for the one who are hard working.
Therefore if you can do yog then do it but if you can't
then take Sagun devotion. If you want to search within then
go in to yog. What has happened? From where have we
lost the directions of devotions? There is no place for
Nirgun in Sagun Bhakti. There is no place for Sagun in
Nirgun. It is said-
Jete Drishyam Tete Anityam, Jete Adrishyam Tete Nityam.
Both lead to different places. Sagun leads to the
attaining of heavens, but if you want to obtain Sayujya
mukti or Brahma lok then it can't happen. You need to do
yog for that. In Nirgun, devotee is focused on Aatm-tatva.
Even in Sagun Bhakti you need to have focus. However, in
that Guru will ask you to have holy baths, to go to
pilgrimages, to do good deeds and to study the Shashtras.
To go into Nirgun you need to follow one of the five
Mudras. Yogi urge you to follow Yog. Shukdev ji was a
Sanyasi, Gorakhnath and Dattatrey are the ones who never
got married. The world is entangled in the mixed up
devotion.
Bin Jane Jo Bhkati Karai, So Nahin Bhavsagar Se Tarai.


Changing the world spiritually 121
I have repeated these words many times-
Pratham Puran Purush Puratan, Panch Shabd Uchara.
Soham, Satt, Jyoti Niranjan Kahiye,
Rarankaar, Onkaara.Shabd Hi Sugan,
Shabd Hi Nirangun, Shabd Hi Ved Bakhana.
Shabd Hi Puni Kaya Ke Bhitar, Kar Baitha Asthana.
Jo Jaki Upasna Kina, Uska Kahun Thikana.
Sahib says that initially, Saravshaktiman uttered five
words- Soham, Sat, Jyoti-Niranjan, RRankaar, and Onkaar.
These five words are uttered by Paramatma. No other
sound came out with these five. It means that the one who
uttered these words is God, they are not mere words.
Hence, those who call shabd to be Paramatma they are
worshiping the Niranjan not of true Lord, Sahib.
Sagun and Nirgun both are under the control of these
words. Shabd is seated in body. He is saying that I am
showing you the destination which you reach by one's
devotion. Sagun is till 3. 3 Million deities. It is not being
decried but it is said that it will result in two muktis not in
self-Realization. There is no self-knowledge in heaven. So
let’s see what has been obtained by the ancestors by five
Mudras through odds whether they have left any messages
for us. Sahib Ji is not contradicting these words but he is
saying that this is not Adyatmic Spiritualism but yog.
Jyoti Niranjan Chachari Mudra, So Hai Nainan Mahin.
Tehi Ko Jana Gorakh Yogi, Maha Tej Hai Tahi.
Some are still immersed in these mudras. Gorakh ji
followed chachari mudra, he observed Brahmacharya-
celibacy very strictly.
He was popular and gave good direction to celibates.
But now there is the talk of yog for grihasth-house holders.
They will not be successful. This needs persiverence. Sahib
Ji says-
Yahan Bhog Tahan Yog Vinasha.
..But this Mudra will not provide Atam gyan. There are a
lot of powers in the human Body. It is known as 'Narayani
chola'. It contains all kinds of powers. When the koshika


122 Sahib Bandgi
(Nerve cell center) of third till awaken then a lot of
incredible and heavenly secrets are revealed.
We are living in the era of medical science. The
scientists have every knowledge of the every pore in
human body but they are still unable to comprehend
information on 'koshika'. They are trying but they haven't
gone deep into it yet. Therefore in Chachari mudra there
are a lot of help and blessings available. A key opens the
lock. Similarly, meditation opens the koshika. Then, a
devotee obtains the knowledge. It provides you with many
powers, of siddhis and viewing of universes and Brahma
can be seen. That’s why yogis talk about Alakh Brahma.
That brilliance is so much that they consider it as
Paramatma.
Shabd Onkaar Bhuchari Mudra, Trikuti Hai Asthana.
Vyasdev Tako Pahichana, Chand Surya So Jana.
Vyas ji meditated on Agya Chakra. By concentrating
here, the nerves center open up.
Kar Naino Deedar Mehal Me Pyara Hai.
When your meditation is successful with one pointed-
ness, you witness many worlds through concentration.
Distractions will break the meditation. Whenever you face
any trouble, if you concentrate here the solution to the
problem can be found. It is opened with the help of
Meditation. Meditation is the master key, that's why-
Dhyan Hi Ved Shashtra Kehat Hain, Dhyan Hi Ved Bakhana.
Today many people Meditate at this point. Therefore,
this opens the koshika but the Soul is not awakened. In the
debate between Sahib and Gorakhnath, Sahib says that you
can do yog but what you will do when ida-pingla and
shushumana will not be there (death of body), then where
will you concentrate.
Ida Vinshe, Pingla Vinshe, Vinshe Shushman Nadi.
Kahe Kabir Suno Ho Gorakh, Kahan Agaiho Tadi.
This means that when these nerves perish then what
will you do.


Changing the world spiritually 123
Gorakh ji lived till 700 years. There have been six
Yogeshwar on this earth in which two are the greats, Shivji
and Gorakhnath ji.
Shiv Gorakh So Par Na Paye, Aur Jeev Ki Kaun Chalaye.
Shivji is the first yogeshwar and the last one is
Gorakhnath. That’s why their meditation strings are
important in our religion and yog. With yog, Gorakhnath ji
with manipura yog had summated bones and body meat in
one. His body became so hard that even a hammer bounced
back if hit. Similar is the case with Shivji. Gorakh ji kept
his body for 700 years. Ramanand ji kept his body for 500
years...... so Gorakh nath ji asked Kabir Sahib Ji-Since
when are you a recluse.
Kabte Bhaye Bairagi Kabir Ji, Kabte Bhaye Bairagi.
Sahib said-
Nath Ji Hum Jabse Bhaye Vairagi, Meri Adi Ant Sudhi Lagi.
Dhudhukar Adi Ko Mela, Nahin Guru Nahin Chela.
Jabka To Hum Yog Upasa, Tabka Phiron Akela.
Sahib Said from the time that when there was no Guru
or Disciples, I was Sanyasi. Now the question arises is that
what his age was. He said-
Jo Bujhe So Bavara, Kya Umar Hamari.
Asankhya Yug Parlaye Gai, Tabke Brahmachari.
Koti Niranjan Ho Gaye, Parlok Sidhari.
Hum To Sada Mehboob Hain, Soham Brahmachari.
Dash Koti Brahma Bhaye, Nau Koti Kanhaiya.
Sat Koti Shambhu Bhaye, Mori Ek Palaiyaa.
Kotin Narad Ho Gaye, Muhammadse Chari.
Devtan I Ginti Nahin, Kya Shrishti Bichari.
Nahin Budha Nahin Balak, Nahin Bhat Bhikhari.
Kahai Kabir Sun Gorakh, Yeh Umar Hamari.
Sahibji said, “What can I say about my age? There has
been dissolution infinite number of times and since that
very time I have been wandering as a Brahmchari
(unmarried). Crores of Niranjans have expired and 10 crore
Brahmas, 9 crore Krishnas and 7 crore Shivjis have also
come and gone and the time taken during all this process is


124 Sahib Bandgi
just a moment for me. O Gorakh! Crores of Narads have
come and gone; many Mohammads have also met with the
same fate; there can be no count of the gods and in such
case what can we say about this poor universe. I am neither
old nor young and this is all that I can say about my age. In
other words, I have been here since time immemorial and
nothing can be said about my age.”
The one who lives in Paramanent or Constant State of
Awareness (Param chetan awastha), no matter in which
world he resides, he doesn't descend, his knowledge doesn't
deteriorates, he does not adapt knowledge, and less any
Awasthas. That’s why he is saying since millions of
Dissolutions, I am wandering as Brahmachari from then.
Paltu Sahib Ji says-Koti Pralaye Ho Gayi, Hum Na Maran
Hara.What is death? These are the play of four Awastha-
Shushupti-Deep Sleep, Swapan-Dream, Jagrat- Wakeful,
Turiya-Casual. All wander in these four states of
consciousness. Whenever a human reach in shushupti-deep
sleep, then his conciousness becomes kund- zero. You are
entangled in these states so that you can't know about your
other births. In shushupti the consiousness of human is
1000 times less than that of jagrat-waking. Therefore,
remembrance or memory is not the changeless Soul; it is
an awastha-State of Consciousness-mind. Shushupti is also
known as deep sleep. And when we wake up then we strain
ourselves to know where we are, disorianted? You obtain
the answer when the Consciousness enters the Agyachkra.
When it happens, then you are conscious. Sometimes we
tell someone to come to his senses. So he collects his Surti
in his eyes, this is what it means to come into senses. Mind
wants to keep you unconscious in shushupti-Deep sleep
and swapan-Dream. This is the same state that remains in
death.
Some remember their past lives. In the deep sleep
forgetfulness remains, however they remain conscious,
therefore they remember their last life.


Changing the world spiritually 125
In wakeful state you can see, but deep sleep you cannot.
When you enter dream state some purity remains of
experience. When we are in wakeful state we have
illusions, thoughts and Intellect may not concur, but dream
state is very different from this state, Mind gets focused ant
it appears real, unlike the wakeful state which is deluding
and artificial.
For some you say it is very good but it does not come
from the heart. All that we see in wakeful state appears
true, this is a play of that state. The fourth state Truya is un
natural, devatas-Angles remain in this state, and Yogis are
also in the fourth state. They are centered on the Agya-
Bindhu. But mind remains even here. After this is the
Turya teet. Yogis could reach only up to Turya state, even
this is not simple, in this state the wisdom raises by a 1000
fold. Reaching the Turya state one claims “I am verily
Brahma". The fifth state is Turya teet, they call it maha
Pragya Awasta- Super consciousness, it is not easy, and in
this state control of Mind is possible, but not complete
control. Some faculties come under control, one can
witness many manifestations. Maha Yogeshwars reach this
State, Mind and Maya remain under greater control. Just as
Blood circulation of a Man in Coma continues, without
stopping, similarly remains the Mind in Turya teet state, it
has even life. What Bliss is in the Soul, where does this
come from, Soul is saturated with Bliss, and mind cannot
access it. Whatever pleasures we drive is from the Soul,
and not from the matters. Where ever you fix your
concentration there it appears that you found the pleasures,
mind makes the contact. When a child concentrates on its
mother, it drives happiness from her. When it grows up the
child's concentration will be on play, earlier it was not
leaving the mother but now even if she needs the child, it
won’t go, now the interest is on game. Children are playful,
and enjoy it. Child then goes to the mother only when the
need arise. However there was no pleasure in it, it was


126 Sahib Bandgi
there in Soul. Mind and Maya drives the entire life. This
world is relatively real and worthless, no bliss in it. 'Hai
Kabira Phir Gaya, Phikha Hey Sansaar|' Where ever we
concentrate their, we drive pleasure. Concentration itself is
blissful. When we withdraw this concentration to self we
can be in bliss of Bliss. When the children take to study, he
concentrates on it, he will keep studying even up to 12
midnight. This is the attraction, where ever you concentrate
their, you will reach. Therefore, if your Dhun-
concentration is engaged on this world, then you will take
repeated Birth in this world. Where one is concentrated
there he will be. On marriage, sex, children what else, this
concentration keeps drifting. In Old age people are
engaged in monetary transactions, dealing money gives
happiness. The matter you concentrate does not have
happiness that happiness is within you only. The pleasure
is kept connected with eternal plays, sometimes in sex,
wealth, status and some Mind and Maya entangles the Soul
all the 24 hours. Mind remains in all the states. Even if a
seeker roams among the universes in great void (Maha
sunya space) it is in Mind. Time in self esteems etc. When
we become steady in concentration then we will realise the
boundless bliss, however Mind will never allow this, not
even for a moment.
Tan Tirr Mann Tirr Vachan Tirr, Surati Niraati Tirr Hoy|
Kahey Kabir Va Palak Ko, Kalp Na Pavey Koy||
A moment in stillness with concentration-Surati and
Pranic force-Nirat and without individuality-Tan, Mind-
Maan, is better than other spiritual practices done for ages.
Even with realization such moment cannot come. Mind
and Maya will keep you drifting always. The Milky Way
galaxy that we see, billions of such galaxies can be
accommodated in every void space which exists. Imagine
scientific attainment of those Great Souls-Mahapurushas.
In this human Body are hidden great secrets.
Gurunanak Dev Ji also says-'Koti Brahmanda Da Tu


Changing the world spiritually 127
Malik _...|_ ' no matter how many lives a man takes he does not
forget. However, there is a state beyond that, Kabir Sahib
was in it, where awareness-chatna has no death. 'Turiyatith
Tahi Te Paara, Vinati Karey Tah Daas Tumhara' This is
higher wisdom state, on reaching it one can never decend,
he may remain in that awareness within the body, where
ever he wants he can reach there. Some time some souls
wants to meet because they can regain that state, they get
great power to do that. Nothing can be put in to the Soul.
However, there is a veil imposed on the Soul and the exit is
closed for the Soul.
Kabir sahib has told about his being a Bhramachari. He
say Niranjan appeared a millions of times, In spite of his
level of indescribable bliss his intellect was unsteady and
did not increase and stayed same. Krishn Ji told Arjuna that
they have taken many births together in time, and said that
he remembers them all but not Arjun. We forget to
recollect. You are not aware because your state is afflicted.
Krishna was in state of higher consciousness. It remains
through many life times and they remember all. To know
you have to rise from forgetfulness. You’re young in age
(Mental). Those who are in fifth stage (Maha Yogeshwars)
never forgets, however those who reached the 6th state
(Sant Satguru) never returns to a lower state.
Some time we call a medical assistant as a Doctor,
Similarly we call anyone as a Sant, so and so Sant etc.
The Devatas-Angles are also in the state of Prgya
awasta. If we keep some items outside it gets spoiled, in
the Fridge it remains much longer. If kept frozen it does
not get spoiled, dead body remained in ice for a longer
time.
Beings are the creation of Brahma and Maya. Animal
live in the state of dream. Human are in Wakeful State.
Dev-Angles in Turya State- Casual. Maha Yogeshwars in
Trya teet-Super Casual state. Those who are in even a


128 Sahib Bandgi
higher level, is a changeless state of awareness is called a
Sant. 'Nanak Sant Akaal Sadahi||' they are free from Mind

. Iron gets corroded in weather, however in contact with
touch stone (Paras Pattar) it becomes valuable Gold. Now
it will not corrode becomes stable. When a Sant reaches
such State he does not return in to the realm of Mind.
When Iron turns in to Gold then problem of corrosion ends
for ever... Kabir Sahib says Corores of Niranjans ended,
the creation of void space also comes to an end, even
Great void space also comes to an end In front of me 100
million Brahma Jis were born, 70 million times Shambu
appeared and gone, then it is just a moment for me.
Scriptures also says when it is one year to human on
earth, it is one day in the ancestral world. When it is one
year in ancestral world it is a moment for Brahma ji. 100
years of Brahma ji is just a moment for Vishnu Ji. 100
years of Vishnu is just a moment for shiv ji. Life of one
Shiv Ji is just a moment for Adya Shakti Maya. Maya Ji's
one life is just a moment for Niranjan. Niranjan's many
life time is just a moment for me says Sahib. People come
to argue. Kabir sahib says, if you ask about my age, I do
not come down from my state of Soul-fullness. Soul has no
age in Amarlok.
I tell only that much which can be understood by you,
more than that is beyond your grasping power. 'Taha Nahi
Parley Ki Chaya|' There is no dissolution in Amarlok from
where Sahib has come. Sahib says;
Haad Maans Lohu Na Morey, Hou Satnaam Upaasi|
Taaran Taran Abhay Pad Daata, Kahey Kabir Avinashi||
Satya Swaroop Naam Sahib Ko, So Hey Naam Humara|
Jyoti Swaroop Alakh Nirr Jann, So Japey Naam Humara||
When the soul moves to Amarlok crossing innumerable
universes on the way, it is not like that you had been there
for the first time. It feels that you have reached your true
home. Just as we feel when we wake up from sleep, and
realise that the dream was just unreal. The feeling is that


Changing the world spiritually 129
we were in a degraded states. There is no hunger, thirst,
weakness, or sleep in Amarlok. I am surprised, we do hear
that Soul is eternal, however the Soul is not evident
anywhere here. We find in the scriptures that Soul cannot
be cut with a sword, water cannot drown it, to get that kind
of form why we do not make an attempt. We are not even
cautious about the one who has willfully embodied our
Soul.
Vyas Ji meditated on Agya Chakra, with concentration
if this cells are activated it can take us to Turya state. Yogi
can reach only up to this level.
A man got hurt, he was taken to the nearest clinic.
Doctor said that the damage is severe, suggested taking
him to a bigger Hospital. He was also a Doctor, however
there was no facility available in that clinic. If the disease
cannot be cured they send them to Super specialty hospital,
which is better equipped. If even that is not helpful we are
asked to go to USA where more facilities are available.
Similarly Yog is alright, but with yog the reach is up to
Turya only. The consciousness will remain for 1000s of
years but will decrease, there is pleasure in it however
cannot stay in that level for long but decent. Then Sahib
says; 'Tahake Gaye Bahuri Na Aaye, Aisa Desh Humara Hey||'
There is no returning from Amarlok, no rebirth.
With a Matador- (Small truck) one can go on road up to
Badi Brahmana (Jammu). Maha Purushas says that with
Nirgun Devotion (form less) one can reach up to Nirakar
(Invisible) God only. It is little bit on a higher level. It is
very subtle. Even in the Yog it is said.
Sohang Shabd Agochari Mudra, Bhawar Gufha Asthana|
Shukdev Taako Pahichana, Sunn Anhad Ki Taana||
Agochari Mudhra is superior to Bhuchari, they go in
and sit in the Bhavar Gufa, and they bring one pointed
concentration. This is a play of Surti-Concentration.
Banknal is such a spot, mind becomes subdued. There the
Consciousness is alert and pleasurable, some sounds are


130 Sahib Bandgi
called as Surati Abyas, there are Sounds inside, and they
merge in that. Some refers to it as the highest stage,
however one cannot cross the Truya teet state with it. All
have their limits. Even Sounds has an end. 'Jaap Marey
Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Marr Jaay| Surati Samani Shabd Mey,
Usko Kaal Na Khay||' Then what is that sound, it cannot be
written or spoken, Kaha Na Jahi, Likha Na Jayi|. Sahib says-
'So Toh Shabd Vidheh|' It is Soundless Sound, because -'Do
Bin Hoy Na Adhar Aawaja|' It requires two to create a sound,
where there are two there is duality, Maya. Bhank Nal is a
pure state. Even today people follow this.
I have told some, that we will print our books, my
people told me that it costs Rs 7 lakhs, and I can get it for
Rs 6 lakhs. In the mean while our secretary said that if it is
available for that amount, then what the use of our men is.
On further talk they offered it for Rs 5.5 Lakh. I become
little apearhensive at the down ward revision of rate. I
came to know that it was available at one place for Rs 5
lakhs, then this party also offered it for Rs 5 lakhs, even
then I did not buy, they came down to Rs 3 lakhs. In the
mean while a Naami arrived, he was from a press, and
asked us not to buy that machine and said that it is sold as a
scrap, and added that these days because of simple
computerized machine which can be operated by two
people are available. Then the owner of Rs 3 lakhs
machine came and enquired as to why are we not taking it
even at Rs 3 lakhs, I told it that you where offering it for 7
lakhs, he never returned after that. These day there are
many cheats therefore be beware of them. You do not have
to ask, in the field of devotion the Heads of organizations
does not know what is good for them.
Once I went to see Delhi, about 30-40 years back,
thought of buying a Radio. At Chandhni Chowk one gave a
quote of Rs 700, I told him it is costly. He offered it for Rs

650. I told him again that it is high. He said that it is the
     first sale of the day so asked for Rs 500. I asked that at 4


Changing the world spiritually 131
pm you are doing your first sale. He said that he just came
in his shift. I asked to reduce the rate. Then he asked me to
tell him my offer. I suspected something. In the meanwhile
he asked for Rs 400. I did not tell replay. Then he asked for
Rs 250, then 200 and then 100. I asked him to reduce the
price further. He said that I have been asking for reduction
after reduction, therefore asked me to tell him how much I
am ready to give. Earlier to ask for Rs 20 against Rs 700
was embarrassing, I offered him Rs 20, he agreed. I asked
him to take the money, I do not want the Radio, however
requested him to tell the truth. He told me that he is still
benefited by Rs 8. I asked him as to how. He told me that
it will work for just 5 mts and it is a counterfeit Radio ant it
is not repairable. I told him that I would have brought it
back to him. He said that he will tell that he never gave it. I
have seen behind him some bad persons. There are many
more things. Even in the field of Bhakti same game is
there.
Do not get influenced by sweet words of Mahatmas. Do
not get attracted with his dance. Do not be satisfied with
what he just says. First look at the level of his attainment,
whether he has himself has travelled in to the inner world
or not.
We do not decry path of Yog, however there are states
beyond this also. One should realize that.
A man came to me and started speaking on inner
Sounds (Dhun), he gave examples and said that I am
saying that Dhun is also destroyed. He said that Dhun -
sound is the ultimate. I told him that it is just a transit state
and not an ultimate state. It gives a state in which there is
no desire or anger in the Mind, however it is not the Goal.
We think that just by reading four Dhohas of Kabir Sahib
we have understood all, but beware because;
Kabir Ka Gaya Gayega, Teen Lok Me Mar Khayega.
Kabir Ka Gaya Bujhega, Antargat Ko Sujhega.
Furthermore,-


132 Sahib Bandgi
Sat Shabd So Unmti Mudra, Soi Akash Sanehi.
Tame Jhilmil Jot Dikhave, Jana Janak Videhi.
Shukdev had to take Diksha from King Janak as his
Guru because he was the expert in Unmuni Mudra.
Rarankar Khechari Mudra, Dasvan Dwar Thikana.
Brahma Vishnu Maheshwar Deva, Rarankar Ko Jana.
Then, above all there is fifth Mudhra Khechari. In this
the tenth door, is to be opened. Those who are best in it are
the trinity Gods. People are contradicting but we are telling
explore and see. There are incredible mysteries in this
human body.
Shiv Goprakh So Pach Pach Hare, Is Kaya Ka Bhed Na Paye.
In this, Mahashunya is experienced by opening the
shushumana. The opening of tenth door enables you to
wander anywhere. But Sahib says-
Sidh Sadh Trivadi Le, Panch Shabd Me Atke.
Mudra Sadh Rahe Ghat Bhitar Phir Aundhe Muh Latke.
Yogis, Trinity Gods and others could reach Mahasunya,
great void space. Still they have to hang upside down
means to come back in mother's womb. ‘Punarjanmam
vithaty’ means there will be rebirth. You will be back in to
maya, The Inner journey happens with, path of Fish-Meen,
Ant-Papil and Bird-Viyangam. Yogi travels in Meen and
Papil path, not with Viyangam
Iske Age Bhed Hamara, Janega Koi Jananhara.
Kahin Kabir Janega Vohi, Japar Kripa Satguru Ki Hoi.
Satya Bhakti-True devotion revolves around Satguru. It
has a lot of importance of Sar Naam. In this, Soul returns
to its own world by crossing the eleventh door to never
return to this world again.
Where will the being goes with Sagun-Nirgun devotion,
Sahib explains it again. There is the importance of trigun
(Quality, property, trait; one of the three constituents
Sathwa-Calm, Rajas-Passionate and Thamas-Dullness,
they bind the Soul to the body) devotion in Sagun
devotion. Sahib says-
Har Har Naam Sada Shiv Era, Taso Door Na Hot Bhav Fera.


Changing the world spiritually 133
Bahut Preet So Shiv Ko Dhyave, Ridhi Sidhi Bahut Sukh Pave.
Man Jiske Nischay Kar Dharhin, Giri Kailas Me Basa Karhin.
Firke Kaal Jhpete Bahin, Dar Dey Bhavsagar Mahin.
Means there is no profit. You will obtain Riddhis,
Siddhis (Miraculas Powers), pleasures but you won't be
able to get rid of this Bhavsagar-worldly ocean of life and
death. You might even obtain a place at Kailash-Shiv Lok
but Kal Purush will again throw you into the world of Pain
and Pleasure. That’s why-
Shivsadhan Ki Yeh Gati, Shiv Hain Bhav Ke Roop.
Bin Samjhe Yeh Jagat Sab, Pare Maha Bhram Koop.
Did you obtain human body for this no, this body was
allotted to you so that you can go to Amar lok. However,
the human doesn't understand. Furthermore-
Hari Hari Naam Vishnu Ko Bhakha,
Shub Aru Ashubh Karm Hai Rakha.
Inme Kare Kalol Sadai,Kare Bhog Jeevan Bharmai.
Bahut Preet So Vishnu Ko Dhyave,
So Jeev Vishnu Puri Ko Jave.
Vishnu Puri Me Nirbhaye Nahin,Firke Dar Dey Bhumahin.
Means security is not even there. There is fear. There is
no protection but only in the Amar lok of Sahib and
Satguru. Furthermore-
Hari Har Brahma Ko Naun, Raj Gun Vyapak Hai Sab Thaun.
Brahman Ko Pujai Sansara, Jeev Na Ho Bhav Te Nyara.

Auran Ko Shiksha Sab Dehi, Tate Milai Na Param Snehi.
Pap Punya Ke Lekha Karhin, Bina Bhakti Churasi Parhin.
Brahman Ki Yeh Kartuti, Brahman Puje Hoye Na Mukti.
Mukti is not even in this. If there is a Mukti in Sagun
devotion then we need to rise above it. Above it is Nirgun
devotion but we have to go above it, to reach the devotion
of Sahib, Satya Bhakti of Satguru. There is the concept of
Yog in Nirgun devotion, but Sahib says-
Sun Dharamdas Bhaktipad Uncha,


134 Sahib Bandgi
In Sidhi Koi Nahin Pahuncha.
Yogi Yog Sadhna Karai, Bhavsagar Se Nahin Tarai.
Means you can't even cross over with the Nirgun
devotion. Sahib says-
Jaye Niranjan Mahin Samai, Aage Gamya Na Kahu Pai.
Aise Teen Lok Sab Atke, Khare Sayane Te Sab Bhatke.
Rishi Muni Gan Gandharv Aru Deva,
Sab Mil Karen Niranjan Seva.
Sadhak Sidh Sadhu Jo Bhayeyu, Inke Aage Koi Na Gayeyu.
All the Siddh, Sadhu, Rishi, and Muni etc. they keep
appearing of this world. They have reached till formless
Niranjan only. Nobody could go beyond him. They all
worshipped Niranjan. No one could understand the true
devotion. Therefore no benefit.

He says that I will give you the summary of devotion.
There have been many devotees till date, but there hadn't
been any yukti. Everything has a yukti. Mahayogeshwar
Shivji knows Adi devotion in which there is the chant of
RRankaar which is the reason for the formation of world.
However, this devotion has been kept hidden. Shivji and no
one else knew this devotion. Nevertheless, my devotion is
beyond this. The devotion about which I am talking can't
be done by the Yogeshwar then what is of common man.

Sanak, Sanandan, Sanatakumara, Sankadik (Sons of
Brahma) reach only till Niranjan after their devotion. There


Changing the world spiritually 135
have been many types of devotees in this world but no one
has been able to reach Amar lok. Everyone is lost in the
sensual pleasures. They are drowned in those senses and
take birth in through the same sensual pleasure, and could
not escape. Those who knows the secret of my devotion
doesn't come in the mother's womb again.
Jo Tum Puchho Bhakti Prakara, Taka Bhed Suno Ab Nyara.

Aise Bhool Pare Sansara, Jaise Utre Bhav Jal Para.
Dharamdas! The question you are asking about the true
devotion-Satya Bhakti, so firstly, you should know that
dancing, singing, ringing bells, puja etc. all of these doesn't
come under the devotion. These things don't make Sahib
happy. All these are the web of kaal because mind is the
one that sleeps, awake, cries and laughs. Hence, still the
time you are not internally awakened these external
engagements cannot improve Surti. What type of true
devotion is that in which you don't even have the Satya
Naam. There is no address of true supreme lord-Sahib.
What is the benefit in being mentally happy with false
devotion? We can find a lot many devotees but even they
don't know the secret of true devotion-Satya Bhakti.
Without first seeing (Supreme Truth) if one describe it will
lead nowhere. The whole world is entangled in external
things, then how can they cross over this world of sorrow.
Not that way.


136 Sahib Bandgi
Dharamdas Tum Ho Budhhivanta, Bhakti Karo Pavo Satsanta.
Ek Purush Hai Agam Apara, Takonahin Jane Sansara.
Taki Bhakti Se Utre Para, Fir Ke Nahin Le Jag Avtara.
Bhakti Hi Bhakti Bhed Bahu Bhari,
Yahi Bhakti Jagat Te Nayari.
Dharamdas! You are intelligent, so go in the company
of Sants and obtain the true devotion. There is a Supreme
Being whom his world knows not. With his devotion a
person attains eternal salvation from this worlds and
doesn't come back in this world. This is the secret of true
devotion which is exclusive and independent from the
other devotions of this world. Dharamdas ji asks-
Dharamdas Kahai Suno Gusai, Puran Purush Basai Ihi Thai.
Kehi Vidhi So Seva Kije, Kaise Charan Kamal Chit Dije.
He asked, where does that Param Purush lives. How
can I do this devotion?
Pahile Prem Ang Mai Aave, Sadhu Dekh Samukh Hoye Dhave.
Charan Dhoye Charanamrit Leve, Priti Sahit Sadhu Ko Seve.
Joi Sadhu Prem Gati Jane, Ta Sadhu Ki Seva Thane.

Suratai Nrip Kar Tahan Pahunchave.
Taso Bhakti Karo Chitlai, Chhado Durmati Au Chaturai.
Tabhi Param Purush Ko Paye,
Bhav Tarke Jag Bahuri Na Aave.
Sahib said that first he must develop devotion to a real
Sadhu (Satguru), he should serve him well. The Sadhu who
knows the concept of true love, serve him. He is the only
one who can take you towards the devotion of Param
Purush. Do his devotion because he is the only one who
can take you across this world. Dharamdas ji asks-
Sagun Bhakti Kare Sansara, Nirgun Yogeshwar Adhara.
In Dono Ke Paar Batava, Tum Kaisi Vidhi Tahan Man Lava.
Satya Baat Mohi Kaho Ussai, Kehi Vidhi Surti Lagaun Dhai.
Satguru Sanshay Dehu Nivari, Main Jaun Tumhari Balihari.
Sagun Nirgun Bhed Bataun, Teesar Nyar Mahin Lakhaun.
Tum Sat Satya Tumhari Bata,Main Yachak Tum Samrath Data.
Sahib! A common worldly man is devoted to Sagun,
Yogeshwar do Nirgun devotion, but you are saying that


Changing the world spiritually 137
your devotion is beyond these, I don't understand that how
do I meditate. Tell me the secret of the Sagun and Nirgun
devotion and tell me about the third incredible devotion. I
know that you are true and all your words are true. Then
Sahib says-
Sun Dharman Samrath Hai Nyara, Tako Nahin Jane Sansara.
Yogeshwar Veh Gati Nahin Pai, Sidh Sadhak Ki Kaun Chalai.
Bhakti Hoye Jagat Me Bhari, Dhruv Prahard Sada Adhikari.

Aise Bhakt Bhaye Jag Mahin, Param Purush Gat Pavat Nahin.
It is said that Param Purush is the very incredible whom
no one knows. Even yogeshwar can’t get that gati-state
then what can siddh or sadhak do. There have been many
devotees in this world but no one could know the secret of
Param Purush, hence, they were unable to overcome cycle
of rebirth in this world.
Dharamdas ji asks-
Dharamdas Bujhe Chit Lai, Satguru Sanshaye Dehu Mitai.
Sargun Bhakt Mukt Nahin Hoi, Hai Veh Ekhi Ya Hai Doi.

He asked whether the Sagun devotees can get free. Is
that Sagun another or is there only that Paramatma. Please
explain to me the secret of Sagun-Nirgun. From where did
this world come from, who is Brahma and what is Maya?
Tell me the secret of the devotion because I know you have
arrived in this world to release the beings from this world.
So Sahib says-

Tame Adhar Bhavan Ik Jaga, Akshay Naam Akshar Ik Laga.
Naam Kaho To Naam Na Jaka,
Naam Na Dhara Jo Kaal Tihi Taka.

He said that if that is called man then it is not a man
because man has been created by nature. Then if we
consider him as shabd (Sound) then he is not even that
because shabd has been created by Maya. When two things
collide then there is the formation of shabd. Where duality
exist there remains Maya. However, that Amrit-Sagar
doesn't have any boundary. It is an Akshay lok, it never
vanishes. It doesn't have a name because he is not even in
the limit of Akshar (word) as in case of Kal. He doesn't
have any name, it's wordless, and no one know it.
Dharamdas that is my residence, even Kal Purush can't
reach there. Those who worship him never take birth again.
However, here is one more thing. The Sagun and
Nirgun devotees have begun to think themselves as
Satguru. They are trading materialistic Naam with the
stamp of Sahib. They are using the words of Sahib but they


Changing the world spiritually 139
themselves are entangled in these three loks. But Sants
have a fourth lok beyond these three loks. They have tried
to make the humen understand, that this world belongs to
Kal, asked to rise above it and head towards our own
world. Don’t return from there to this hell. Reaching Amar
lok is the true Param moksh. Those who truly surrender at
the feet of real Satguru are the ones who get the
deservedness to reach Amar lok, others keep on entangled
in the web of Sagun and Nirgun.
Satguru Sharan Na Avahin, Fir Fir Hoye Akaj.
Jeev Khoye Sab Jayenge, Tihun Par Kaal Ka Raj.

## c. The Grace of Satguru.

Bahu Bandhan Te Bandhiya, Ek Vichara Jeev.
Jeev Vichara Kya Kare, Jo Na Chhudave Peev.
Kabir Sahib is saying that beings can't free itself with
its own power. Because the thing which has bound it is
very powerful. You read that Sringi Rishi’s Tapas was
interrupted by lust, and anger of Bhrigu rishi disturbed his
devotion.
Krodh Kiye Gati Mukti Na Hoye.
Means that it was done by the internal enemies. From
where do they come from? The powers that have bound us
can't be unbound by us on the strength of our own power.
Jeev Vichara Kya Kare, Jo Na Chhudave Peev.
Own power is useless in this case. For some it caused
misery. Therefore they ask you to be charitable, to visit
pilgrimages for remedy etc. No doubt when they tested,
they protested against Sahib's message. It’s natural.
Sahib said that the power of Niranjan which is us as
formless Mind, it will not let anyone unbound himself with
his own power. You hear in the stories that Rishis and
Munis did devotion for long of time but then got trapped in
the tangles of lust or anger. If they couldn't get rid of lust
or anger then how would they get rid of Mind and Maya?


140 Sahib Bandgi
Lust is a hand of Mind and Anger is the second hand.
That’s why-
Kitne Tapsi Tap Kar Dare, Kaya Dari Gara.
Grih Chhod Bhaye Sanyasi, Tau Na Pavat Para.
So there comes the concept of Grace of Satguru. One
Mahatma asked that how will Satguru help cross the Ocean
of Life and Death. This is beyond my understanding. This
is correct, this is beyond their understanding. Because they
don't have this power of assistance-Grace. Sahib says-
Iske Aage Bhed Hamara, Janega Koi Jananhara.
Is this a propaganda? No. Not by the effort of yog not
by just good deeds. That’s why Guru is not given
importance.
Yeh sabb sadhan se na hoyi, tunhari kripa paye koyi koyi.
No sorts of techniques can help us in realising all this.
These can be realised only by your grace and blessings.
However, Sant Satgurus are revered-giving Greatness.
Every person of other pant is talking about their Guru's
Greatness. Sant-hood is different. Firstly, there was yog,
we **_don’t_** find word Sant or Satguru before Kabir Sahib.
Now those who are into Sagun devotion, even he is called
Sant? In Sant-hood it is said that Guru will take you
across worlds to Amarlok. They are saying that it would
be done in a moment. Does any Rishi or Muni said this?
No. Sant-hood revolves around Complete Guru. He is not
saying that he will instruct you about the path, but he is
saying that he will give Salvation- Param Moksh in a
moment. Nirgun talk about the earnings merits and power.
There will be conflicts. Sahib says-
Koti Janam Ka Path Tha, Guru Pal Me Diya Pahunchaye.
Those who are earning are confused. We are telling two
things- Dharsan-Auspicious Sight of Satguru and service.
Hence, the flow of Sants revolves around two things.
Hari Seva Yug Char Hai, Guru Seva Pal Ek.
Tiska Pattar Na Tula, Santan Kiya Vivek.
This Sant-hood kept on Changing with time. The
Nirgun devotees overpowered it. After the departure of real


Changing the world spiritually 141
Sants, some ambitious relatives took over their place.
However, they were not competent to understand and
follow the concept of Sant-hood. That’s why they mixed
up both Sagun and Nirgun with Satya Bhakti of Sants.
They only say those things to keep the people with them,
it’s just like getting customers. Some say that they should
continue to worship who they were worshiping before. If
this is the case then why a Guru is needed? Sant-hood has
been popular. However, they don't have the Paras Surti.
Paras Surti Sant Ke Pasa.
If there is no Paras Surti from Param Purush of Amar
lok then the Guru is cheating on his pupil. Because then he
wouldn't be able to mold them like himself. (Bringa Matt)
Paras Me Aru Sant Me, Tu Bao Antro Man.
Veh Loha Kanchan Kare, Veh Karile Aap Saman.
Guru Ko Kije Dandvat, Koti Koti Parnam.
Keet Na Jane Bhring Ko, Karile Aap Saman.
These words are conveying that Guru is great. They are
establishing eternal the existence of great Guru. He
awakens the power within you by giving you the Naam.
Purush Shakti Jab Aan Samai, Tab Nahin Roke Kaal Kasai.
Therefore Sahib didn't contradict it. He is asking us to
keep the concentration on Satguru, who will ensure param
Moksh.
Bin Satguru Banche Nahin, Koi Kotin Kare Upaye.
Only then you could be free from the web of kaal. He is
powerful. So the one who is directing you to reach Param
Purush with Sandhana and good merits is not a Satguru,
there is a doubt. Goswami Tulasi Das ji says-
Yeh Sab Sadhan Se Na Hoi, Tumhari Kripa Paye Koi Koi.
Sant Kabir Sahib says-
Adakar Khuud Khajane Se, Chhuda Le Apne Bande Ko.
Sahib asks the Guru to release the disciple with Guru’s own
power from this world.
You must pay from your own treasure. The individual
soul cannot free itself with its own power. Because this is
unknown territory, this Hansa is bound by many


142 Sahib Bandgi
attachments. Moreover, its own earnings or own power of
Sadhana is not enough for the being to break free of these
bondage to reach the Amar lok.
Sagun and Nirgun Bhakti, both contains the concept of
earnings merit and or Power or Naam Kamaaye, there is
not much importance to Guru in them. Guru only points
towards a direction. Now whatever pupil achieve is the
level to which he rises. Those who are not able to do that
waste their lives in this. However, there is no concept of
earning-Punya in true devotion because with this the being
can only wander in the three worlds and can't leave these
worlds. In Mahashunya, there are many magnetic
attractions. The being on reaching forgets about itself
there. In this scenario, the Satguru takes you in to his won
Surati and cross over to Amarlok. Otherwise even after
crores births in devotion, you won't be able to cross over to
Amarlok.
The System of Sant-hood became violated with time.
The Vihangam Chaal (Path Bird) began diminishing. All
that remain here was path of Meen and Papeel. Papeel
refers to an Ant and Meen refers to fish. So, it refers to a
wander in the universe with the gait of an Ant-Papeel and
to move forward with the speed of a fish-Meen. There are
five Mudras. First two Mudras are known as Papeel and the
next third Meen. But the Vihangam chaal of Bird is only
followed by the Sants.
Kahain Kabir Vihangam Chaal Hamari.
In the journey of the universes, the devotee go out of his
body; he is well aware of this fact that he is walking and
that it's not a dream. He witnesses fourteen loks. This
journey is not a simple one. However, travel ti Amarlok is
not possible with self effort. There is the feeling of a
companion with you. Kabir Sahib says-
Chala Jab Lok Ko, Shok Sab Tyagiya.
Hans Ka Roop Satguru Banai.Keet Jyon Bhring Ko,
Palat Bhringi Kare.Aap Sang Rang Le,Le Udai.


Changing the world spiritually 143
Means this being can't go on his own. Whenever this
happens, it can witness in all the ten directions.
Whenever you concentrate, it pulls you with a magnetic
attraction. He is pulled by the magnetic powers but the
devotee is unable to talk to the Guru. However, in
Vihangam, Satguru accompanies you in Meditation, and
there is full conversation between the two, explain all that
which are seen on the way. They travel with the intensity
of the desire. The intensity of desire will decide that at
which speed you will travel. This desire provides you
power. If you want to stop then you will be able to. This is
unimaginable. The devotee walks towards the ten places
and when he reaches at the end of universe then he can't
go forward with his own power. Even here can reach
there with the hard work and yog. It is said-
Rarankaar Khechari Mudra, Dasvan Dwar Thikana.
Brahma Vishnu Maheshadi Le, Rarankaar Ko Jana.
You can reach Rrankaar with your own power, not
further than that. You can go out of this body whenever
you wish to. But-
Koi Koi Pahuncha Brahma Lok Me, Dhar Maya Le Aai.
......so the devotee fly with great speed in Vihangam. When
the Niranjan lok is reached there, he forgets about his
identity. Like the form shiftes in the dream, similarly, the
state is changed. Everyone says- Beant, Beant, ...Beant.
There is so much pleasure there that there is no sudh. It is
the source of intense light, that's why it is called jyoti
swaroop. Its explanation is everywhere. Here while passing
through, the Soul of the devotee is retrained in the Satguru
himself. It is a transparent body, the devotee witnesses
everything. When the Shunya is crossed, the Satguru
release the devotee from himself. Then, the Soul asks him
that why he, Satguru has left him now? Now the Satguru
answers that the power of pull of Niranjan there is so
strong that even if you are with me even then he would pull
you towards him. That’s why you are restrained in me!


144 Sahib Bandgi
........so someone who has travelled this journey and then
someone says that he has gone by his own power, then
obviously, the person can be tested if he speaking the truth
or not, can you not? Sahib says-
Kitne Tapsi Tap Kar Dare, Kaya Dari Gara.
Grih Chhod Bhaye Sanyasi, Kou Na Pavat Para.
Means those who say that you can reach Amarlok with
own effort, it means they don't have any knowledge. Sahib
says-
Adakar Khud Khajane Se, Chhuda Le Apne Bande Ko.

Na Kuchh Kiya Na Kar Saka, Na Karne Yog Shareer.
Jo Kuchh Kiya So Sahib Kiya, Bhaya Bhaya Kabir Kabir.
..So next comes the sea of Surti, the concentration that is
working inside you, it is the main component of that sea.
This Soul is bathed there. It is the main source of light.
With this process, the Mind leaves completely and when
that Soul presents itself in front of Param Purush, then it
shines with the brilliance of 16 Suns. Then it becomes
awake...so after that he returns, after that he doesn't go
there with the same route (Surati Yog). All the middle
routes vanish (you attain Viyangam Chaal- Path of Birds).
This is the blessing of Satguru. Can this be done on your
own? Never. Hence, Sahib says-
Hari Kripa Jo Hoye To, Nahin Hoye To Nahin
Kahain Kabir Guru Kripa Bin, Sakal Budhhi Beh Jahin.

```
“Koti Janam Ka Path Tha ,
Guru Pal Mein Diya Pahunchaye”
Within a moment (Not days and Months) the Satguru enables
you to cover the path of ages together- Param Moksh.
```

Changing the world spiritually 145

## d. Satya Naam-Soundless Sound.

```
(Nishabad – Sar Shabd is beyond 52 Alphabats or
Anhad shabd-dhun)
```
The heart can't be purified without the Sajeevan Naam.
Naam Bin Hriday Shudh Na Hoi, Kotin Bhanti Kare Jo Koi.
But this is not that Naam which has been understood by
the other worldly people. Dharamdas ji asks Sahib-
Dharamdas Kahi Suno Gosai, Purush Naam Kahau Samujhai.
Sahastranaam Jo Ved Bakhana, Neti Neti Keh Bahuri.
Kaun Naam Ko Sumiran Karai, Aise Sada Purush Chit Dharai.
Kaise Avagaman Mitai, Kshar Nirakshar Keh Samujhai.
He asked whether it is those thousand Naams which are
mentioned in the Vedas or is it something else. Make me
understand this concept to stop the cycle of Birth and
Death in this world. Furthermore, Sahib says-
Sunu Dharmani Tum Hans Piyare,
Tumharo Kaj Sakal Hum Sare.
Sumiran Adi Main Tumhe Sunavo, Sakal Kamna Tor Mitavo.
Nam Ek Jo Purush Ko Ahi, Agam Apar Par Nahin Jahi.
Ved Puran Par Nahin Pave,
Brahma Vishnu Maheshwar Dhave.
Adi Kahaun To Ko Patiai, Ant Kahun To Parlai Jai.
Adi Ant Me Vasa Hoi, Nirakshar Pavai Jan Soi.
Akshar Keh Sab Jakat Bakhane, Nirakshar Ko Marm Na Jane.
Not even the Vedas and Puran know the secret of this
Naam.
This world knows about the Naam of 52 alphabets. The
Mahatmas are giving this Naam Now a day. This is the
Naam from thousands of Naams from the Scriptures but
Sahib says-
Naam Par Vedan Nahin Pava, Neti Neti Keh Sab Guhrava.
Everyone knows 15- 20 Naam. If those Naams can give
miraculously something, then there would not be any need
to glorify the Name of Satguru, even a child could have
given the Naam.
How is this Naam? Then Sahib says-


146 Sahib Bandgi
Kaha Na Jai Likha Na Jai, Bin Satguru Kou Nahin Pai.
Satguru Milai To Agam Lakhave, Hans Ami Peevat Ghar Aave.
Ankuri Jeev Kahe Nirbana, Pavat Hans Lok Pahichana.
Surtivant Pave Nij Veera, Sang Rahaun Main Das Kabira.
Jo Koi Hans Pravana Lei, Agra Naam Satguru Kahi Dei.
Bin Satguru Koi Naam Na Pave, Pura Guru Akeh Samjhave.
Akeh Naam Veh Kaha Na Jai, Akeh Kahi Kahi Guru Samjhai.
Samujhat Lok Pare Puri Chinha, Jate Lok Hoi Lavlina.
Hardum Sumire Chit Lagai, Lok Deep Me Jai Samai.
Ajar Amar Hoi Lok Sidhave, Chaurasi Bandhan Muktave.
Avagaman Tahi Nahin Bhai, Jara Maran Ka Beej Nasai.
This Naam cannot be spoken, this is not a subject of
speech. It doesn't come under writing. No one can obtain it
without Satguru... Only a complete Guru-Satguru can make
you understand. With that Naam, the being can cross the
Chaurasi (84 Lakhs of Life forms) to reach the Amar lok.
Why is there such deep relationship between the Naam
and Satguru? Because this Naam is incredible and and
come form outside this universe, it can only be obtained by
devotion, to a real Satguru. If we realise that the glory of
Satguru cannot be sung with the Naams of this world that it
becomes easy to understand Satya Naam easily. This can't
be found in Scriptures/books. Because this is beyond 52
Alphabats (Hindi), it is a thing which is alive.
Guru sajeevan naam bataye, jake bal hansa ghar jaye.
The Naam given to us by phonies does not take us to
Amar lok because they fall under the elements of sound,
they are in the limit of 52 letters. So these Naams are in the
possession of everyone. So Sahib cautions-
Koti Naam Sansar Me, Tinte Nukti Na Hoye.
Mool Naam Jo Gupt Hai, Jane Birla Koye.
There are crores of Naam in this world but you can't be
liberated by them. The Satya Naam which is hidden can
only be known by a very rare Sant.
This mool Naam can't be obtained without the help of
Sants. The Sandal doesn't spreads its smell by itself, Sea
can't provide his water to anyone by itself. However the air


Changing the world spiritually 147
carries its sweet small to a long distance and provide joy to
people and keep them in a pleasant mood under any
condition. Cloud will carry the water from the sea and it
rains water from the black clouds. Trees will become green
and pleasing, Birds will be happy and peacock will spread
his feathers and will began to dance. Without Sant Satguru
even Param Purush also will be handicapped.
Sahib Ke Darbar Me, Karta Keval Sant.
Karta Keval Sant.Hukum Me Unke Sahib.
Sants and Satguru are the ones who descend and bestow
the power of poorna Paramatma tatva of Param Purush in
to the Disciple. This is called Naam. Without this Naam no
being can cross this world in to Amarlok. This Sajeevan
Naam takes a being to the Amar lok. Furthermore,
Kaal Tihakal Ka Bhed Sunaun,
Dharamdas Main Tohi Lakhaun.
Nih Agyar Ka Bhed Nij Pave, Nih Akshar Mahin Jaye Samave.
Jo Nahin Gyan Niakshar Bheda,
Ta Mahan Kal Karat Hai Chheda.
Ni Akshar Bin Kalna Jite, Yagya Dan Sab Kal Vyohara.
Kal Gati Sansar Hai Bhai, Birla Jan Koi Lakh Pai.
It is said that yog, yagya and alms all are the forms of
activities connected with Kal Purush, Those who don't
know the secret of Ni-akshar, Kal will be with them. They
will have many short-comings, Kal can take control of
them any time. He can be consumed by the kaal anytime.
Without the Bodiless Sajeevan Naam from a real Satguru
Kal cannot be defeated. Even if one is man of charity, of
merit and Penance, he cannot escape from Kal Purush.

Jahu Veg Tum Va Sansara, Jo Samajhe So Utare Para.
Bar Bar Tum Jag Meein Jayee, Appan Kah Sab Katha Sunayee.
The Supreme Lord told Kabir Sahib, “You go to the world
at once and explain this devotion to the souls. Ones who
understand it will get salvation. You go there again and again
and tell them about Amar Lok.”


148 Sahib Bandgi

Surati Yog - 11th Door- Concentration

The eleventh door beyond the tenth
Before Kabir Sahib there was only mention of the tenth
door. Sahib gave the secret of the eleventh door. Even in
Vedas there is only mention of the ten doors. The Yogis
could go up to tenth door but the Yogeshwars could
wander in the other universes beyond the tenth door; but no
one had the knowledge of the eleventh door. If we look at
the Sants of today they have no knowledge of Satya Naam,
nor the tenth door; then how will they know about the
eleventh door.
There are nine doors in the body. Two for ears, two for
eyes, two for nose, one for mouth, urinary and anal
passage. This is the knowledge known to everyone.
However, none knows the secret of the tenth door. Now
let's understand what this is.
The Shushumana nerve is situated within Ingla and
pingla. This is the nerve which goes towards the tenth
door. Now the left swar in the left nostril is Ingla and the
right counterpart is Pingla. The nerve between them is
Shushumana, which has been closed by the cough or
disuse. This goes above the heads, this is the way to tenth
door. However, shushumana is not tenth door, it is the
medium for the tenth door. Some people who don’t have
any knowledge of the tenth door say that it is pointed on a
part of body which is incorrect. If there would have been
something like this then the doctors and scientists would
have already mentioned. They have today become more
advanced than they have ever been so, they would have
revealed that secret. Nevertheless, it is not like that because
there is no place like that. Now how one can enter in the
tenth door? How does it open?
Ida Ke Ghar Pingla Jai, Sushumana Neer Rahe Thehrai.
Method of Open shushumana is given in the verse..
Surti Ke Dandse Gher Man Pawan Ko.


Changing the world spiritually 149
Sahib has said this in layman's language. Reverse the
breath upward direction with concentration-Surati. When
asked, the people from another pants how to open the
Shushumana they reply that it is not to be replied. This is
not a thing to be veiled.
They say that this is not to be revealed as Guru has
prohibited them from doing so. This is same as when you
ask someone that what is the route to Pathankot (Punjab-
India) and the other replies that go to this station then you
can see from there. Similarly they kept quite when asked
about opening Sushmana Nadi. We have taken it as a very
miscivious response. Then how does it open? It is closed.
There are a lot of complex parts inside a body. It contains
blood, urine, semen and fecal matters. Therefore, the
Shushumana nerve is closed by cough. What is this cough?
This is the same cough that is related with asthma and cold.
Where does it form? Where Ida and pingla are
concentrated, there the cough forms. Niranjan has closed
that entrance with cough. How to open it? A single nerve
opens at any one time, either Ida or pingla. When two-swar
work in same direction then the cough will remove from
the Shunya. How to open the Shushumana?
Murshidey Kamile Se Mil, Sidak Au Saaburi Se Taki.
Wo Tuhe Dega Feham, Dilbar Pe Jane Ke Liye.
Our Soul is immersed in the breaths. These contains four
main alongside each one having four subs. breath means
air. They flow in 9 nerves and their 72 knots and activate
them. Those who are walking, speaking, listening,
working, and all activities are by this life breath. These 10
airs are doing their work while remaining in various parts
of the body. Just like electricity flows in a wire, similarly,
Soul is immersed in breaths. Where are they? There are ten
Prans like Apan, Saman, and Udan etc. Apan helps in
digestion, and it’s a great necessity, it helps in excretion of
fecal matter, if this air reaches any other part of the body it
can cause harm, if it reaches heart it can cause heart attack.


150 Sahib Bandgi
If it reaches brain, it can damage them. Nothing is extra in
the body. Wherever this air resides, this is harmful. Then
the Udan resides in the liver. The third life air Prana
resides inside the heart. The fourth one Sarvatanvyam
remains in the joints. Dhanjay resides in arms and chest.
Paralysis is an air distortion. Saman air restricts the body
from getting fat. Naag remains in the throat and it brings
sleep, if this is afflicted then insomnia results. Kirkil
remains in the front portion of the nose. This doesn't let
other airs mix with one another. So like this there are ten
different airs working inside a body. Soul is immersed in
these. Now from where does these breaths is transpiring?
Shunya Se Swansa Uthat Hai, Nabhi Dal Me Aye.
It Rises From Shunya-void space, and reaches Nabi.
Marte Marte Jag Mua, Maran Na Jana Koye.
Whenever you want, the body can be left by itself. This
art was known by King Janak, that's why he was known as
Vedehi (Out of body). Nevertheless, no one can go further
in to universe with this art.
There are electricity cuts now. Firstly, electricity is
provided in one place and after that in another one.
Similarly,
Pawan Ko Palat Kar Shunya Me Ghar Kiya.
When there was debate between Sahib and Gorakh, then
Gorakhnath asked Sahib-Kabir Kaya Madhye Sar Kya? What
is the essence of body?
Sahib said- Kaya Madhye Swansa Sar.
Subtilest essence in the body is Breath.
Gorakhnath- Kahan Se Swansa Uthat Hai, Kahan Ko Hai
Jaye. From where it come and where it ends
Sahib- Shunya Se Swansa Uthat Hai, Nabhi Dal Me Aye.
It comes from Void Space and ends in Naval-Manipura.
Gorakh- Hath Panv Iske Nahin, Kaise Pakdi Jaye.
How can we catch it when it has no hands or legs?
Sahib- Hath Panv Iske Nahin, Yeh Surati Se Pakdi Jaye.


Changing the world spiritually 151
It does not have hands or Legs, it can be caught with
concentration-Surati
It can be molded. A tyre is filled again and again. This is
a system with which the Air is collected. He is saying-
Surti Se Pakdi Jaye.
Catch it with concentration
Furthermore, Sahib Says-
Surti Ke Dand Se,Gher Man Pavan Ko.Fer Ulta Chale.
With a rod like Surti-Concentration, turn the air upwards.
....fer ulta chale, dhar au adhar vich dhyan lave.
kahain kabir so sant nirbhay hua, janam au maran ka
bhram bhane.
With reversal of breath move upward with concentration
and attain the fearless state beyond Birth and Death which
Sants attained.
This is said in Ramayana by Goswami ji-
Ulta Jaap Japa Jab Jana, Balmiki Bhaye Bhram Samana.
People believe that they had chanted 'mara' 'mara'. No,
this was the upside down version. Paltu Sahib says-
Are Haan Re Paltoo,Gyan Bhoomi Ke Beech Me Chalat Hain
Ulti Swansa.
Sahib says-
Pavan Ko Palat Kar,Shunya Me Ghar Kiya.
Dhar Me Adhar Bharpoor Dekha.
Kahain Kabir Guru Pure Ki Mehar Se,
Trikuti Madhye Seedar Dekhs.
How shushumana does opens? It is closed by cough. The
body contains cough and air. Sahib says-
Gagan Ki Gufa Ko,Pavan Se Saf Kar.
Which Is This Cave? Dum Hi Dum Me Le Ajooba.
How to clear it? How this cave is cleared by air? It is
written in books but it can't be understood without the help
of a complete Guru. Here the breath and Naam should be
made in to one. This breath is heat. Running heats your
body which melts the cough. Therefore, with the bringing
of breath-Naam, with its heat the coughs begins to come
out. The cleaning of Nasal passage will create a sound like


152 Sahib Bandgi
nails grinding against each other. It has a scraping sound
and the air will pierce through the cough.
Whenever the disciple does this process, he should
concentrate on Guru. As the pupil rises in his level, he
would need the guidance of a Satguru. The pupil will feel
that some power is pulling him upward. But mind doesn't
want you to reach there because it knows that if you reach
there, you will understand everything and the world will
lose its attraction. Hence, the Mind deludes you.
Sushuman Madhye Base Niranjan, Mundha Dasvan Dwara.
Uske Upar Makartar Hai, Chado Samhar Samhara.
Mind will confuse you cleverly so much that you won't
be able to proceed. What can the pupil do? He fears, the
Mind immediately distracts him to another proposition of
his life to divert him. It will pull you towards the sorrows.
With all this, the concentration which had reached high
comes down. It’s similar to climbing the stairs and then
falling from top. Similarly the Sadhak falls, so beware.
Slowly, pleasure also begins to penetrate you. If there is no
concentration then there is nothing left except the waves of
Mind and Maya. The Mind waves take you to another
places. Then the being feels that there is no blessing of the
Guru. Mind tries to distract you from attaining that source.
It’s puts efforts to keep you entangled in the world. It
brings all kinds of thoughts and distracts you. However, if
the disciple remains concentrated then slowly breathe
ceases and shrinks.
Marte Marte Jag Mua, Maran Na Jana Koye.
Aisi Marni Na Mua, Bahuri Na Marna Hoye.
Sahib Says-
Ja Marne Se Jag Dare, Mere Man Anand.
Kab Marhun Kab Pauhun, Puran Paramanand,
Sometimes you feel that you are on doorstep of death.
Some says that they also feel fear. If you try to close your
hand you cannot close. Some even say that they were
frightened. When all the air enters in to the Shushumana,
then it opens up. Cough gets removed. Some say that they


Changing the world spiritually 153
experienced pleasure, then again lost. However remain
thoughtless.
Mita De Apni Hasti Ko, Agar Kuchh Martaba Chahe.
Ki Dana Khak Me Milkar, Gule Guljar Banta Hai.
Paltu Sahibji says:-
Paltu Pehele Marr Raha, Pachey Mua Jagat||
This means die while living. Slowly, the breaths began
to stop. Then the mind starts to feel uncomfortable, no
need to run or swim, only needs to sit in concentration.
Disciple would feel that there is no body. They feel getting
lost, Mind will create such thoughts. You will begin to feel
that you are dying, such thoughts emerge. It’s the Mind
effort to distract you from the Concentration. As the
Concentration will increase, the body will turn frigid and
Disciple will starts to look for the body immediately.
Mritak Hoye Ke Pave Santa.
You will feel like there is nothing exists. The wishes of
life float around you. You will get promptings to return.
Koi Koi Pahuncha Brahm Lok Me, Dhar Maya Le Ayi.
If you stay steady the slowly, the breaths begin to
disappear. You will feel your leg cannot be moved, frozen.
Mind asks where breath has gone. It create illusions and
doubts. It tangles you in wishes and desires. These are the
things which have stopped you advancing onward to the
tenth door.
Gaflat Nahin Tahan Hoshiyar Dekhna.
Here, there is the need of concentration and hard work.
Jahan Khoja Tahan Paiya, Gehre Pani Paith.
Slowly, you begin to realize that you are not body. You
become astonished. This happens in a state of awakening.
It feels that some active state is disappearing. It can't be
seen, but it feels like that.
Mind will create disturbances, it will tell that legs are
frozen. He will point that you are drowning in the dark.
Sehaj Jan Jano Sai Ki Preet.
The mind tries to divert you. Sometimes it takes a full
lifetime. Tahan Silhali Gail.


154 Sahib Bandgi
To get stuck in breaths is also an illusion. Slowly, the
breath reaches 1 ¼ Hand hight above the head, Ashtam 8 th -
chakra seat of Satguru. There is the life power. It pulls up.
Surti Kamal Satguru Ko Vasa.
Slowly, it concentrates. Mind says that you are dead and
no breathing too, Mind is very clever it has confused
everyone.
Jeev Ke Sang Man Kal Rahai, Agyani Nar Janat Nahin.
A shunya- Void space is created. You feel that you are
something.
Pavan Ko Palat Kar, Shunya Me Ghar Kiya,
Dhar Me Adhar Bharpur Dekha.
Kahain Kabir Guru Pure Ki Mehar Se,
Trikuti Madhye Deedar Dekha/
Here, with in a fraction of a second one enters in to the
passage and the boundary of the realisation starts.
Sahib says-
Khaskhas Ke Dane Ke Andar, Shehar Kkhuda Ka Basta Hai.
Kast Kare Eno Ke Til Me, Vahin Se Uska Rasta Hai.
Rooh Rehkane Me Thehraye, Soi Mukur Me Dasta Hai.
Par Bin Mehar Murshid Ke, Tu Nahak Me Hi Pachta Hai.
Hence,
Shunya Mehal Ki Feri Dehi, So Vairagi Pakka Hoi.
When Void Space inverts, it enters into the
pragyawastha. There is no other window to open. If this is
so, then the scientists would have revealed it ages ago. This
is the opening of the tenth door. This is beyond
imagination, the truth.
Now the Disciple knows how to proceed further. But
sometimes even after going once the being might forget to
do it second time. Just like you forget the place you visited
once. On regular visit you remember all the intermediate
points. Mahapurush keep visiting that place. Therefore,
you get a body for all that travelling. This is a spiritual
journey. Sometimes it can also be carried out while lying.
Maha Purush have made this travel Sahib says-
Khel Brahmand Ka, Pind Me Dekhiya,


Changing the world spiritually 155
Jagat Ki Bhrahmna Door Bhagi.
Bahara Bhitra Ek Akashvat,
Shushumana Dor Tahan Palat Lagi.
After the journey through the internal worlds one comes
back into their body because even after going beyond tenth
door there remains a small part of themselves in the body
therefore they return. Now, let's head toward the eleventh
door. Where is it? How to enter it?
Nau Dware Sansar Sab, Dasve Yogi Sadh.
Ekadash Khidaki Bani, Janat Sant Sujan.
Before Kabir Sahib, no one was aware about the
eleventh door. This door is the one which relates to the true
devotion Sathya Bhakti, because one reaches the Amar lok
after crossing this door. After that it depends on our wish
whether to return in this body or not.
This eleventh door is inside our Surti-Concentration.
Now the question arises that how does it open? This opens
solely by the Guru Grace. Even after crores of years of
devotion and Sadhanas, one can't open it. This is the reason
that even the great yogis have only been able to go to the
tenth door. It doesn't open with your own power. Like a
doctor can't perform surgery on himself, similarly this can't
be done without the help of Satguru. When disciple attains
oneness with Guru, only then this is possible, and can be
completed. On this Sahibji says-
Na Kuch Kiya Na Kar Sakha, Na Karne Yog Sharer|
Jo Kuch Kiya Toh Sahib Kiya, Bhaya Kabir Kabir||

When there is convergence between Guru and his pupil,
that's when this task can be completed. That’s why Sahib
says-
Guru Shishya Aur Ishwar, Mil Kina Bhakti Vivek.
Teeno Tridhara Bani, Aage Ganga Ek.


156 Sahib Bandgi

## 9. Code of Conduct for Disciple.

Following are the rules and regulations-

1. Always Speak the Truth.
2. Don’t consume meat
3. Don’t use Intoxication, (No Alcohol and Narcotics)
4. Don’t steal
5. Have pure character, One Life Partner.
6. No gambling
7. Earn by fair means

## a. Speak the truth.

Sanch Barabar Tap Nahin, Jhooth Barabar Pap.
Jake Hriday Sanch Hai, Take Hriday Aap.
There is no greater penance than the truth. There is no
greater Sin than a lie. The heart that does not contain truth,
There the Lord will not enter. Never promise anyone that
you will come tomorrow or any other day, what if this
body leaves you in the middle of it. Then you wouldn't be
able to go to the Amar lok, you will have to take birth
again to fulfill the promise. So always, reply that if Sahib
wishes then I will come.
Follow the truth with perseverance. There are eight parts
of the truth. Lies create great losses, even more than
drinking alcohol. The memory of an alcoholic person is not
good. No matter how much a genius, we will have no faith
in a drunken Man’s ability to do a good job. He will not do
it. The nerves of our brain are affected by this. He could
never be intelligent. The power of drugs affect straight on
the thinking power of the brain. There is more effect
needed to speak lie. Speaking a lie is harmful for our Soul
and consciousness. Naturally our Brain and Heart are
accustomed to speak the truth. Children always speak truth.
Human tell lie for two reasons- one for hiding his
shortcomings and secondly, for his selfish reasons, means
for his own selfishness by hurting others.
Sometimes we see that a thing is broken by mother then
she tells her child not to report it to his father. The child


Changing the world spiritually 157
learns the power of a lie from there. He thinks that lie can
protect you. He learns it in childhood. Means, how to lie is
taught to him, it’s not in their nature to make up a lie. Lie
weakens the nerves of the brain, therefore never expect
good from it. To walk on the path of the truth is a great
penance. Sahib says-
Sanch Barabar Tap Nahin, Jhooth Barabar Pap.
Jake Hriday Sanch Hai, Take Hriday Aap.
'Satya Saman Dharm Nahin Ana..'
According to the shashtras, there is no Religion other
than the truth. No matter where is one living, the one
following this culture is a Hindu. Let’s see, truth has eight
parts- speaking truth, following truth, and thinking
truth etc. one might think illicit about the other's mother or
sister but we forbade our mind from thinking like that,
even about our own mother and sister. This means that
your thinking is in your control. Therefore, the thoughts
should be true. Not one grain should be a lie. That should
also be truth.
A King and a Mahatma were childhood friends. They
both had one Son each. The King died and also the
Mahatma followed soon after. The King's Son became
King. On the other hand the Mahatma's Son never married
and became a Mahatma. They both were friends. The
Mahatma had full access to the castle. One-day the King's
diamond got lost. He became depressed. Search on widely
carried out. However, it wasn't found. The queen said that
Mahatma might have taken it, but the King denied it and
became angry. After some time the queen once again
suspected the Mahatma arguing that he is the only person
who has access to castle apart from them. The next day
Mahatma came and gave the diamond to the king and said
that I won't come to the castle now, I have become thief.
When he turned back, the King stopped him and said that
you are not a thief. Then he asked where did you eat that
day? The Mahatma replied that, at the house of a


158 Sahib Bandgi
goldsmith. The king assured Mahatma that it was the grain
that was responsible for burglary not you. When that grain
got out of your body, you came to return it. It’s the grain
not you.
Therefore the resolve should be truth, behavior should
be truth, work should be truth, speech should be truth, and
listening should be truth. If your food are pure then the
intellect will be pure, if the intellect is pure then the
wisdom will be pure, if the wisdom is be pure then the
Dhyan-concentration will be pure and if the concentration-
Dhyan is pure then you will be entitled for Moksh.

## b. Do not eat meat.

Hindu religion is standing on truth and non-violence.
This religion is saying you stop violence, not to hurt
anyone. So the one who eats the flesh has fallen low. How
can we say they are observing Dharma, no way! Sahib
says-
Mansahari Manva, Pratayaksh Rakshas Jan.
Taki Sangat Na Karo, Hoye Bhakti Mein Hani.
People say we are Hindu. You know what am I saying? We
are Hindu because truth and non - violence are its two
norms and we are following them. According to me, the
one who consumes meat is violent. He does not remain
Hindu. In a program in Mumbai I asked those who eat
meat raise their hands. A person raised their hand. I asked
him reason for eating it. He replied that it is meant to be
eaten, everyone is consuming it. I said it is not a thing to be
eaten. His reasoning was that about 90% of the people are
consuming meat. Only 10% are those who are not
consuming it. I made him understand that in truth it is not
an eatable. To eat meat is a Godly crime apart from being
a scientific crime. To eat meat is a great crime. It is a
Godly crime because religion says that every being has a
Soul. So think how you would feel if someone eats you in
_pieces. It’s a scientific crime because every vegetarian and_


Changing the world spiritually 159
non-vegetarian have their own systems. The non-
vegetarians have eye system which is more effective at the
night time. They can see their prey. Their eyes burn in the
daylight and they take water with their tongue, their nails
are round in shape so that they could get a grip on the
prey, their teeth are also round and sharp which contain
toxins. on the hand, the eyes of the vegetarian beings does
not hurt during the day, they swallow the water, their nails
are not round but flat, and their teeth are also flat which
are toxin free. Non vegetarians being like leopard, cat,
lion, mongoose etc. follow these norms. I haven't seen any
lion who would flee with a cabbage neither I have seen a
dog eating a potato. All this is according to norms created.
I haven't seen in sixty years that a monkey is devouring on
a bird normally. Neither have I seen that a buffalo is
consuming a chicken. You also wouldn't have seen it. Then
why is human going out of their norms. His nails are flat
and are teeth toxin free. Then why is he not following these
norms. Sant Kabir Sahib Says;
Mansa Hari Manva, Pratyaksh Rakshas Jan.
This is correct.
Now it is said to be a scientific crime because the human
digestive system is like that if they consume meat then
there would be animal diseases.
When I told this to that boy he replied that he was
ignorant now he won’t consume anymore meat.
I am pure vegetarian. Even in army I stayed in my own
norms. Whenever they used to cook meat, I cooked
separately. I don't even eat on plane. When they enquire
then I reply that the hands with which you are picking the
plates full of meat are the same hands with which you are
serving everyone, along with fruits and water.
Jaisa Khao Ann, Vaisa Hoye Maan.
Jaisa Pio Pani, Taisi Hoye Vani.
I went to a shop which belongs to a follower of Sant Matt
to buy some things. The shopkeeper had there the photo of


160 Sahib Bandgi
his Guru. I saw a tray of eggs there. I asked him what this
is. You are the follower of this Mahatma yet you keep this.
He replied that when the customer comes he asks for eggs
along with the other things. If he doesn't get it then the
customer go to other shop where he is told to get eggs from
where he has taken other material. Therefore, they say that
if there is no eggs then they won't take material from my
shop. Therefore, I had to keep eggs.
See, he is compromised. In the consumption of flesh eight
people are responsible for the Sin. The first one is who
nurtures (Animal) them. That’s why I always tell you not
keep a cock or goat. Never cage a bird. You also should
not keep eggs in the shop and also not to deal with the meat
business. It comes under 'Atamvatan Sarvbhuteshu'. When
being recruited in the Army, one is asked to stand in his
underwear to check whether his knees get connected or not
and then he is asked to raise his arms so as to check
whether his stomach is flat or not. After that fitness is
checked by running. If the knees contacts then he won't be
able to run. He will fall. Similarly, there is no place for
devotion in this. Common man wants to pursue devotion
without any disturbance to his routine. The devotion which
does not have any norms, that devotion is not devotion.
Khelna Ho To Kheliye, Pakka Hokar Khel.
Kachi Sarson Per Ke, Khadi Bhaya Na Tel.

No to Intoxicants (Alcohol and Narcotics):
The most dangerous drug to my perception is alcohol.
This lowers the human below the animal’s level. Never
expect anything good from an alcoholic. We cannot depend
on an Alcoholic person.
The effect of alcohol feels like that, they think they can
overcome its effects in the morning, but in reality, it hasn't
left. If one who consume alcohol every day, if he doesn’t
have alcohol for three days will feel disoriented. If he
doesn't drink for 21 days than 50% effect of alcohol would


Changing the world spiritually 161
diminish. Means 50% still remains. If he doesn't drink for 6
months then the remaining portion is 25%. If the alcohol is
abandoned for two and a half year then the remaining
portion is 12.50%. The remaining portion of alcohol in
body remains till 14 years. The effect of alcohol doesn't
vanish that easily.
I was coming from Ambala one day; there was a huge
pile of manure on the side of highway. A person was
laying on it. See, this is the condition of alcoholics. I
stopped my car and woke him. I told him that he was
laying in the wrong place and wrong position. He was
someone's son and brother. However, he answered that we
should leave him there and do not bother him. This is the
condition of an alcoholic. He was under the effect of the
alcohol. I picked him up with my driver and placed him
away from that pile.
Avgun Kahun Sharab Ka, Gyanvant Sun Lehin.
Manush Se Pashua Kare, Dravya Ganth Ka Dehi.
There is an incidence related to alcohol, in Russia there
was a farmer, who was a very calm person. He never got
angry. The King gave the work of making him angry to a
demon.
One day the framer was working in his field. Demon fed
his food to the dogs but the farmer still didn't get angry. He
came to king and upon reporting the incident went back to
the farmer as a servant. He used to mess up things so that
the farmer gets annoyed or angry but the farmer was like
the King of serenity and calm. He didn't get angry.
........then there comes the day of wedding of the Son of
zamindar. The demon made alcohol in which he mixed up
the blood of four animals. Then he served the alcohol to
the guests of the zamindar. Under the effect of alcohol,
people began to fight. The farmer tried to stop the fight but
it was to no avail. After that the alcohol made its own
effect on the farmer and he became angry. He began to
beat up the others with a rod leaving the others stunned at


162 Sahib Bandgi
the behavior of calm farmer. The demon saw his success
and left that place.
The demon came to the king and told him the news of
his success. The king congratulated the demon and asked
the secret of his success. The demon told the king that he
made alcohol with the blood of fox, dog, lion and pig.
Under its influence the peace loving farmer got angry.
This was the story of alcohol. Every person who consumes
it becomes like this. Firstly, he talks in clever ways like
that of a fox and that is because that is the effect of the
blood of the fox. Then after some time there is the effect of
the blood of dog which results in the person to bark. Then
he began to beat people under the effect of the blood of the
lion and in the end, the person loses unconscious like a Pig
and ends up in any dirty alley.
Every drink which includes the alcohol, is a poison. This
creates a deleterious effect on the person. The sake which
consists the most amount of the poison, is the one which is
supposed to be best. So why people are consuming
alcohol? Because at the start it creates a vibrations in the
brain which produces the pleasure for an alcohol.
However, he doesn't know is that this pleasure takes him
towards his destruction. Alcohol destroys one's mind. The
one who consumes alcohol cannot be expected to work to
his full potential because the mind of an alcoholic person is
that of an idiotic person. Many diseases surround them.
Their economic condition also becomes worse. It is
because at one side the alcohol is expensive and on the
other hand in an alcoholic person will hurt his wife or
children. It will also require monetary means. Sahib says-
Avgun Kahun Sharab Ka, Gyanvant Sun Lehin.
Manush Se Pashua Kare, Dravya Ganth Ka Dehi.
Then he will also break things causing loss. Therefore, I
have to make you abandon alcohol to avoid even economic
loss. You will be richer in the means of Naam but you will


Changing the world spiritually 163
also rise in the wealth and status according to the worldly
results.
Any type of drug is not good for the body. This is a
demonic deed. It is written in Quran shareef that the devil
wants to take the human to hell by keeping him addicted to
drugs.
Bhang Tamaky, Dhura, Jan Kabir Je Khahin.
Jog Yagya Jap Kiye, Sabai Rasatal Jahin.
Therefore, cigarette is also not good for health.
However, I haven't banned it. It is also quite dangerous but
not that much so, I have given you some leeway. If you can
avoid it then it is wonderful. Drugs will disorients you and
then you will not able to sit for Meditation -Dhyan and
bhajan.

## d. Do Not Steal.

There was a thief. He loved me very much. He was Kind
hearted. He also helped the poor thieves. He used to feel
sorrows of others. Twenty years earlier, he gave me
hundred rupees and told me to use it to take fruits and food
for my trip. When he asked for the assurance that I will
spend them then I told him that I won't. He became sad by
this and asked the reason. I told him his money is not
earned by the fair means. He told me that his work is even
more dangerous than that of a soldier. It is very difficult to
sneak in to someone's house and steal things under the fear
of police, people if being caught. This is a very difficult
task. To run and to hide is very frightening. To go into an
unknown territory and to look for the key to the vaults and
if not found then to run away, this s a very complex task.
I told him that listen, a person earns for the marriage of
his son or daughter. You steal that from him. Think about
the pain that heart has to go through when you steal that
from him. He said yes. I can't live without you. I am
willing to leave this profession, but I don't know anything
about other works and my expenses are also huge. He used
to live in a rented house and his laundry was also done by


164 Sahib Bandgi
the dhobi. Then he started doing the work of wood cutter.
He was paid 10-20 rupees per quintal. Then one day he
said that he can't even pay the rent of the house along with
the fees of the children. I am under huge loan; please just
let me have a one go. I told him not to worry and I made
him a house. I told him to stay in the Ashram and took full
responsibility for his family. I sent ration to his wife and I
also used to send money for spending. I didn't want that
person to slip. He used to become sad and ready to go out
but I never allowed him. He served in Ashram for 5- 6
years. He didn't let a single pin being stolen from the
ashram. He used to stay awake at night. It is a habit of
thieves, they stay awake at night. His wife had cancer. I
told him not to worry. I gave them my full support
whenever they needed it. When he withered away I helped
his son in study. He did B.Sc. I even got him a motorcycle.
Sometimes he used to say that free me, now I want to earn.
I told him that it was his father's wish that he studies. Do
not worry, even if I have to setup a factory for you, I will
do it.
.......so stealing is a great Sin.
Pap Karmo Se Hai Rehta Jiska Man Mallin,
Usko Sapne Me Bhi Paramatam Najar Aata Nahin.
That’s why I made you abandon Sins. Even if you have
a onetime meal, stay happy in it but never abandon
righteousness. Sahib will look into it. Spiritual powers are
working alongside you.
Khelna Ho To Kheliye, Pakka Hoke Khel.

## e. Be Pure in character.

I have special affection for the persons who have clean
and pure character. Maharaja Dilip Singh was a successor
of Ram ji. He was going somewhere in a sunny day. The
heat was too much strong which irritated him. His minister
told the nature that he is a great king, and urge for wind to
quench the heat. However, there was no response to it.
Then he argued that he has great knowledge so provide


Changing the world spiritually 165
shadow but even then there was nothing. Then he said that
his ancestors are very great so shadow him even then there
was no change. Then he said that he has a pure and clean
character and then there were clouds covering the sky and
even the wind swept around them.
You can love your wife as much as you want to but
always look towards the other female with the eyes of
respect worthy of a mother or a sister. If you are celibate
from childhood then it’s a great thing but this is not a norm
for you. You just have to take care on not heading towards
other's female.
Those who don't have good character will also not have
any association with the Truth. If there is no truth then
there would be no character. Like heat and light can't be
separated from each other, similarly, truth and character
can't be separated from each other.

## c. No to Intoxicants.

The instance of the Pandavas condition due to gambling
is in front of us. That’s why I said no to gamble.
Jua Aaj Na Mua Kal Mua......
Gambling one day destroys you completely so you need
to stay out of its league.
(Sahib Ji quotes the example of eldest son of Pandav
Dhramraj who lost all in the Game of dies, he had the
weakness to gamble)

## g. Earn through fair means.

Never fall in the web of corruption and also don't beg for
the food. Always eat by earning with fair means. Even if
you get a meal for one time be happy in that. If you will eat
from unfair means then it will affect your intelligence.
Your children will also consume the same wealth so even
their intelligence will be like that.
......so it was said to worship the Param Purush in Satguru.
Devi Deval Jagat Mein,Kotik Puje Koye.
Satguru Ki Puja Kiye,Sabki Puja Hoye.


166 Sahib Bandgi
The devotion to a Satguru is equivalent to the devotion to
whole universe. So worship only the Satguru. Satguru
possesses Param Purush hence; it is the devotion of Param
Purush.

## h. What will happen in following Norms?

At the time of Naam- Dhaan, I had told you what to do
and what to avoid. It was not said afterwards. After Naam
you are able to balance between good and bad. So like that
I have taken you far away from the sinful deeds. The
human today are full of fear and stress. Why? This is
because he is cheating and deceptive. That’s why there is
fear. But then why there is tension? When he is not able to
fulfill his necessities then he goes in to corruption. Save
yourself from this. There is Sin that's why you are
drowning in sorrows.
Pap Karmo Se Rehta Hai Jiska Man Malin,
Usko Sapne Mein Bhi Paramatma Nazar Aata Nahin.
Your sins affect your consciousness. If there is no sin
then no one can hurt you.
Jag Mein Bairi Koi Nahin, Jo Man Shital Hoye.
You have no enemy. You only need to work on your
arrogance.
By following the norms, you will be able to increase the
Atam-Shakti. Your Soul will be awakened. The Soul
possesses a many powers but due to sinful deeds of human,
these powers have become veiled. Earlier if a man wishes
for rain it would rain and if he wish for Sun then the Sun
would shine. People used to be truthful and didn't commit
sinful acts then their spiritual powers were awake. You
have to become a better person before entering in to
devotion. The person who is engaged in both devotion and
the sinful deeds is not a worshipper.
Like clouds cover the sun similarly, Soul is veiled by the
sinful deeds. We are not able to sense it. The sin is the
barrier between the Soul and Lord. If this barrier goes
down then they are not away from each other.


Changing the world spiritually 167
Jahan Jana Tahan Nikat Hai.........
If the human doesn’t hurt anyone then how would
society be? Hurt is done three ways- 1). By Thought
(Mind), 2) by Words and 3) by Deeds (Action). If you hit
someone then he is hurt. Our culture says that all the
beings contain unique Soul, so don't hurt them. This is a
crime. Some people don't want to hurt anyone. Pay close
attention to this fact. The type of behavior we expect from
others should be shown to others by us. If you don't want
anyone to abuse you verbally then you also don't abuse
others. When you are angry at someone then to hurt
someone you begin to verbally abuse the other. There was
a person and in anger, he hit a dog. He used to limp. He
wasn't able to control his anger. This was anger. He
remained under its effect for the rest of his life. Never hurt
anyone. All have a same Soul.
We have a mool Surti-fundamental concentration. No
matter where or which state you are in like sleep, Sushupti
or Satlok, it is always there. If it not for this then how
would we have mentioned about the Satlok after arriving
from there and also about Param Purush. This means that
something is left. Just like the basic form of milk always
remains. No matter if you convert it into curd or cheese,
the basic form of milk doesn't diminishes, its taste remains.
It never vanishes. No matter which body is taken, the Surti
is not lost. This concentration is Soul. Now Mind has also
gripped on to it. Even if sourness is added to water, it
becomes sour but its basic taste doesn't withers away.
A Mahatma sees mool Surti inside everyone. This
resides within everyone. This is a part of Param Purush.
Everyone has six bodies inside. Those are incredible and
subtle. These all bodies have their own behavior. It is just
as if you have many suits. One is for summers, one is for
winter, and one is for extreme winter. Similarly, there are
Seven Surtis in which the Mool Surti is the main one. This
is known as the queen of Surti.


168 Sahib Bandgi
Everyone has same fundamental Surati. Even in an Ant,
it is present. Don't get confused with its small form. There
are beings on earth that have the life span of about three
hours and in that time they take birth, grow, marry and
have offspring and then they die. Even they have the Mool
Surati.
I was eating sweets in the garden. I always preferred my
own company over the other children in my childhood. I
used to stay away from them as I always found their
reactions to be idiotic. I was a very serious person. There
was a hill; I used to find solace there. So I was eating
sweets and a piece fell on the ground. An ant came there
and tried to lift it but wasn't able to. I knew that an ant is
one of the hardworking creatures. I followed it; she went in
to a hole which was at a distance of 1-2 minutes. It came
out of that hole with a huge army of ants after it in 20- 25
seconds. They all picked the chunk of sweet. The timing to
pick it was perfect. How was their conscious? That piece
wasn't less than a mountain for them. Some of their legs
bend but they changed their positions and dragged the
piece to their destination. This took about half an hour.
They weren't able to drag it into the hole so they made its
smaller chunks and then dragged it into the hole.
This means that the first ant went to the others and told
them of the festive meal. Then the commander selected the
powerful ants that were able to pick much heavy and
ordered them to go. It’s just like I choose people for
selective works. So it was just like that. Then they were so
much intelligent. The hole was not bigger so they made
smaller chunks. Means they had Mool Surti. This is present
in everyone.
In Satyug, everyone knew the language of animals. This
was the truth. Mool Surati is similar in everyone. Children
cry. Why do they cry? This crying is a language. The one
who understands it knows it. The one who understands it
doesn't know that he knows the language. A mother


Changing the world spiritually 169
understands it but she not sure that she knows it or not. A
child can't speak but he is able to convey himself. This is
Mool Surti. When he cries then he calls you to come to his
aid. Everyone has same language. A number of languages
are spoken which are distinct on earth but the main aim is
to convey your thoughts.
Why does he cry? He is calling his mother. Why Woes
he cries loudly? If he is in more discomfort then he calls.
Why is he crying? It’s because he can’t utter words. He
talks in the language of crying that this is the problem. He
knows that when he cries his mother arrives. He has
knowledge. He knows that his mother understands. This is
a known fact even by the Animals. A Buffalo was
screaming very loudly when I was doing Satsang in
Araniya, Jammu. Nobody paid attention to it. Actually she
was getting irritated due to the excessive heat at her place.
She was saying that I am bound; I want to go into shade
but I can't, release me. She was screaming while looking
towards his owner. I listened but no one else paid any heed
to her. I told one person to stand in the sunlight. After ten
minutes I asked him how he was feeling. He said that heat
was inconvenient. Then I sent him to shift the buffalo to a
shadier place. I observed that she was also thirsty. So I sent
someone with a bucket of water to her. I understood her
language.
Once I was doing Satsang in Chorachaki when many
crows sat on the tree. They were all screeching but no one
shooed them. I listened to them they were telling others
that there is the festive meal here. After much time when
no one shooed them away I asked one person to shoo them
away. I didn't tell them to do that before so as to not create
disturbance in the Satsang.
We have a very clever cow. Two more cows are bound
alongside her. When I feed the three of them she eats the
feed of the other two cows first. Her eating speed is
incredibly fast. She eats the portion of others first because


170 Sahib Bandgi
she knows that the one in front of her is her own share.
One day a cow got free from her bounds and began to eat
the feed. After seeing her other cow began to scream. She
was calling. The one who used to look after them went to
see about the commotion. Means the other cow was
watching that the feed also contained her own share and
the other cow was eating it.
So never be unfair to anyone. Goswami ji says-
Hit Anhit Pashu Pakshin Jana.
The buffalos call to me. When the heat becomes
unbearable then they ask for the fan. When the time of feed
is pushed then they ask to feed them on time as they are
hungry. Means everyone has a Mool surati-fundamental
concentration. Shashtras say-
Atamvatan Sarvbhuteshu.
Observe a small mosquito, when you try to hit it, it flies
away. He knows that it’s an attack. Means the feeling of
protection is possessed in everyone. That’s why the
Religion says not to cause trouble for anyone. That is
because they are experiencing the fruits of their own deed.
In which ever body the Soul takes, the same is bearing
children and experiencing the sorrows and pleasures of life.
Therefore,
Mat Satta Kisi Ko Jalim, Mat Kisi Ki Aah Le.
Whenever you go there is Mool Surati. From where did
it come from? These are the rays which extracted from
Param Purush. These need to be free. It has mistaken itself
for body. It is in deep sorrow. You shouldn't hurt it. It is a
form of lord. Hurting it means hurting the lord.
Have faith. A Soul has the power of speaking every
language. It’s the truth; I have talked to every being of this
world.
I was building a house. In one room, the floor wasn't
laid out due to economic hindrance. It took two years. My
mother told me complete the floor of that room, for using
the room. One day when I began to put stones there lots of


Changing the world spiritually 171
huge ants came out from the floor. They were quite
different red ants. They asked me that why I am causing
trouble for them. They argued that they live there along
with their children. I told them to come out of there.
However, they didn't. Next day I told them to come out in
one day. Nevertheless, they didn't pay any heed to my
warning. I began to lay stones on the floor. A constructor
came and told me that he would do it. But I denied, it was
my personal work and was not at all related to Ashram. I
laid out the stones on the floor quickly. 50-60 ants came
out and said we are inside. I reminded them I had warned
them and now I have to lay the floor so I did. After 48
hours I laid out the floor. At 12 o'clock at night, those ants
came in front of me and told me to break the floor as their
children were there. They were speaking as humans. I told
them that I would not break it after all this hard work; you
can make your other way by digging through the soil.
My words will astonish you. Whenever I go to a Place of
pilgrimage I talk to the deity that is present there. When I
go near Ganga then I talk to Ganga. When I go to the place
of shiv ji then there I talk to him. Where there are places,
the deities are also present there. However, you come back
just like that.
When I was made J.C.O., then I had to give a party.
They asked for party. The main menu of their party are
Alcohol and Chicken. I asked them about the expense.
They said five thousand. I told them that I will give them
Rs, 7000 but there would be no Chicken and Alcohol. If
you want to eat dry fruits like almond then I will give them
to you. If you are under any trouble then you become
weak. Be strong. They even eat like devils. I did not give
the party of meat and alcohol. Some people cause
disturbance even in a rare moment of peace and some have
a knack for finding peace even in a lot of disturbance. I
told them that I will feed them whatever they want but not
that. They didn't budge. Then even I didn't push it. The


172 Sahib Bandgi
time period for these types of parties is 10-15 days. They
told me about instances were higher officials giving such
party, even if some of them didn't consume meat and
alcohol but they still gave the party. I even forcefully told
them that I will not do all this. To pump up they said that I
just don't want to spent money. I reminded them that I am
willing to spend 7000 rupees. They didn't agree. Time flew
away. Even after 6 months there was no party. I said that at
the particular day for meat you can have it. But still they
didn't agree. They were saying about some other day. In
the end I told them that they can drink alcohol, I thought
they will only be in alcoholic state, at least there wouldn't
be killing of any being. In the end, it was decided that the
money would be given and they will do whatever they
want to do. In the evening, at 6 o'clock a boy brought 5- 7
cocks that were held upside down. They were screaming.
At 12 o'clock in the night when I laid down all the cocks
came in front of me and demanded for justice in human
language. What I am saying is truth. They said that I am
responsible. They demanded that either I provide them
with human body or free them. I had to accept one of their
conditions.
I even forbid the killing of snakes. I have evacuated 100-
150 snakes from Ranjhadi Ashram. In that area there is a
large number of snakes. One evening a snake was lying in
a side tunnel. His half body was in it and half of his body
was outside. Just like you feel heat and cold similarly, a
snake also feels it. In case of heat, you take refuge under
fan. So he sat in side that tunnel. Someone noticed it. I
cleared that area and told one boy to bring a long bamboo.
I hit the ground with it 5-6 times and then the snake stirred.
I didn't hurt it and told the others to put it in a bag to throw
it far away from there. Only from Ranjhadi, the ones taken
out are 100-150. All of those who have a body love that
form. Never kill a being. Due to the taste, human kills the


Changing the world spiritually 173
ignorant beings. The world in which you are residing is the
only one, which has karma and nowhere else.
Never hurt anybody's heart. If you find someone's
heartbroken then console them. Don’t think about what
will be the effect of it.
Beshak Mandir Masjid Todo, Aur Bhi Girjaghar Hai.
Lekin Kisi Ka Dil Mat Todo, Khas Khuda Ka Ghar Hai.
I will tell you about trees; even they have Mool Surti.
They also talk. There is a tree in Ranjhadi Ashram. One
day its branch began to swing viciously. I thought that
maybe a big bird must have sat on the branch. I looked
towards that, and then a human neck appeared and greeted
me. In Hindu religion, the trees are worshipped; there is
depth in this concept. So it told me that its branches have
fallen ill. Everyone serves you; we also want to serve you.
I told him to go ahead. He told me to sprinkle the medicine
on him two times- once in December and other in March.
Next day I called the gardener and told him to sprinkle the
medicine at two times. I didn't tell him that the tree
requested me. Then that tree bore many fruits and they
began to fall. I asked that we sprinkled the medicine but
still the fruits are falling. He replied that the medicine was
sprinkled only once. That gardener had forgotten after the
first time. That was an awakened tree. He shed the first
fruit when I was brushing my teeth. It was marvelous, he
told me to eat it. I gave the fruit to Turna and told her to
serve it to me at mealtime. When I ate the fruit, he said that
he is blessed now, that's what I always wanted.
The beings that die at the feet of Mahapurush, they take
rebirth in the human form. The tree whose fruit is
consumed is also set free. The house where I partake meals
mean they have fed the whole universe. To feed 100 yogis
is equivalent to feeding one sadhu. Sadhu is the one who
has stripped him of lust and anger not the one in which the
person has worn that clothing and to feed Sant is
equivalent to feeding whole universe.


174 Sahib Bandgi
So that tree was awakening. He shed his fruit when I am
nearby or the girl Turna because he knows that the girl
doesn't eat it. Others eat it. He even keeps his fruits in
shadow so that no one can find him. Therefore, watch for
Soul in everyone, don't hurt anyone.
Jeev Na Maro Bapura, Sabke Eka Pran.
Hatya Kabhun Na Chhutati, Koti Suno Puran.
We also say-
Dharmraye Jab Lekha Mange, Kya Mukh Lekar Jayega.
He makes your account by this Mool Surti only. Every
being will be accounted for. He never provides injustice to
anyone. There is Chitragupt who announces the
punishment for the deeds. When something complex arises
then he calls for a team from heaven. A meeting takes
place and they along with Vedvyas ji decide the
punishment.
Whenever we venture in universe, there is Mool Surti.
This can't be expressed in words. Suppose someone said
something to Gupta ji and he retaliated by slapping the
person. We all agree that it was right course of action but
your conscience will say that what you did was wrong. A
thing resides within us. Never do anything wrong. Even if
you have spiritual powers don't use them for wrong doings.
Some hurt others with the knowledge of Tratak
(Tantra). If someone binds someone with its power then
you can't even stir. Tratak is done with Surti. If you hold
your breath and concentrates on someone then his breath
will also will be held. If you are crying by concentrating
then that person will also cry. If you want to make
someone run or call someone, it will be accomplished.
Sometimes we say that someone has done something to
him. It is a correct thing. This is known as black magic.
This can only be used to hurt someone. No one can obtain
benefit from this. Mahapurush never hurt anyone in any
way straight or any other way.


Changing the world spiritually 175
A person came to me and said that he loves a girl who is
a doctor. The girl also used to love him but now she
doesn't. I want to marry her, so help me. I thought in the
name of help he means to send someone to her to talk
about him. I asked him what type of help? He said he
wanted me to use hypnosis on that girl. I told him I
wouldn't do it. This is the way to hurt someone. Anyone
can be detached. His heart will become sour. If you heed
these ways then the other person will come running to you.
There was Mahatma in a village skilled in the art of
control. He never let anyone stay in his ashram at night. He
never told anyone to leave, he just use to desist them. The
person sets outside before the sunset, he is not able to stay.
My Gurudev also went to that Ashram. The person fed him
and used his art on him. But my Gurudev caught hold of it
and told him that whatever you do but I will spend the
night here because I am a Sanyasi. I will go in the morning
and then even if you want me to stay I will not. So in the
morning, when Gurudev came out from the house, whole
of the village was standing there will garland. They
remarked that he was first person to stay in that house in 40
years. So the art of desisted is very dangerous.
Lord distributes his powers after a great mulling over it.
A gun is issued to only that person who has a clean record,
the one who is not a criminal. Lord also sees the records.
He sees that after the abstinence of powers will he create
havoc, using them for his own means. He watches if he is
patient or not, then he provides that. When he starts giving,
he keeps doing it.
Sahib knows that you have become pure, so he keeps on
giving Bhali Buri Sabki Sun Lije, Kar Gujran Garibi Me.
Therefore, everyone has Mool Surti. To use the spiritual
powers in wrong and indecent way is also a crime. Never
hurt anyone by thought, words or deed. Be merciful.
Powers will keep coming to you. You only need to follow
the norms accordingly and with perseverance.


176 Sahib Bandgi

## i. What happens when you don’t follow the Norm?

Norms?
Some people say that our norms, principles are very
strict. If I find out that my pupil has done something wrong
then I scold him. What is our pant giving to the society?
We have seven rules. Not to consume meat and alcohol,
not to commit sins, these are not created afterwards alas
they are told beforehand. If you see all around yourself
then you will see that the others are doing these things. If
someone does that here then I take immediate action. If we
are asking you to speak truth then we want you to become
truthful persons. We want to clear your heart. When your
heart is clear only then you will be able to understand Soul.
If you want to do devotion then do it precisely, otherwise it
is of no use.
You are not committing any wrong deed after Naam
Dhaan. At the time of Naam Dhaan you have been told that
the effects of your old deeds-Karmas have been cut down,
cancelled. But don't commit mistakes from now on because
now there would be no forgiveness for your actions. For
speed breakers, at a distance of 100 feet, a board has been
put up cautioning you about the breaker. Why? So that you
could slow down. If you ignore it then it can result in
accident. Similarly, when you will head towards a mistake
then you will be pulled from inside. There would be an
internal sound that will indicate to you not to do that work.
The power of Naam will warn you, caution you. Even then
if you commit the wrong after all this then you will not get
forgiveness. In that scenario, be ready for the punishment.
We have not provided you with the license of bane and
boon. A lady asked me to forgive her husband as he had
consumed alcohol. I asked her that why should I forgive
him? Your husband is not a child that someone forced the
alcohol in his mouth. If I will forgive him then people will
think that we can commit anything and afterwards we will
ask for forgiveness. Then some will arrive that my brother-


Changing the world spiritually 177
in-law was getting married so I had to take 2-3 sips. I said
watch the consequences now. Even others will shiver.
They will become better by themselves. You haven't gotten
better by yourself, I have made you. I am not a dictator, I
state things clearly. Sahib points-
Kabir Ka Ghar Door Hai, Jaise Lambi Khajoor.
Chade To Amrit Pavasi, Gire To Chaknachoor.
The things which have been forbid by me never do them.
It will cause trouble for life time. Be safe from this. Sahib
says- Guru Bachna Tope, Ta Upar Yamraja Kope.
Some are running around as mental disturbed. They are not
like that. They have broken shabad. Sahib says that even
Niranjan gets angry at them and does as he wishes.
Therefore, remain in the services and orders of Guru.
According to me, your mistake shouldn't be forgiven.
There are messages which you are getting from inside.
Then why are you committing mistakes. The other people
of the world are in darkness. There mistakes could be
forgiven. If a blind person steps up in dirt then it’s alright
but what do you do when a person with clear eyesight steps
on the dirt. You will comment on his idiocy. Just like even
after Naam if you commit mistakes then you should be
punished. The only thing is that if you are to be slapped 50
times then it won't be taking place consecutively. It will be
like one here and one somewhere else. It can be shifted to
one slap once and sometimes two. Only this much
concession is allowed for you. However, all of those would
be accounted for 50 slaps. This is definite and decided.
Even this punishment is for your own wellbeing.
What would be the nature of the punishment, let me tell
you. You must have seen a swing. The more it elevates, the
person is left hanging upside down. Sometimes the person
might even urinate. Then no matter how much the person
screams his lungs out to stop the swing the controller
doesn't stop with any reference to person dishevels state.
He has to complete his rounds. Similar is the case with the


178 Sahib Bandgi
punishments of Sahib, he will complete his punishments all
according to earlier setup. He won't stop at any cost. From
the next turn you would fear committing the forbidden
things.
I have punished two beings on Very severely. One of
them was punished more severely. I cut down the
connection of Surti with me. It was the same fate that has
befallen on Niranjan and it was done by Param Purush. It
was his punishment for his numerous crimes. He said that
Niranjan wouldn't be able to concentrate on him now. If he
was to do it, then it would have been real troublesome for
you because concentration provides a great power.
Therefore, Param Purush disconnected Nirakar Niranjan
from himself. The person whom I punished severely had
committed a big mistake. I asked him to leave and never to
come back. He asked that if he sees me on the way then
can he take my blessing. I denied even that. When he went
he said a sweet thing, he said that I know you can't forgive
me for this mistake as it will create discomfort in the
comunity. However, know this even in the flames of hell,
my Soul will only call for you. I will not worship anyone
else. I had mercy for him in my heart but still I punished
him. Why commit mistake.Keep the Love alive.
Rahiman Dhaga Prem Ka, Mat Todo Chatkaye.
Tute Te Phir Na Jude, Jude Ganth Pad Jaye.
You have been blessed with such a great power then
why commit mistake? Even great people don't have this
much knowledge of Merit and Sin as compared to you.
Hence, there is no forgiveness for forgetfulness.

Manahi Ahe Kal Karala, Jeev Nachaye Kare Behala.
Jeeva Ke Sang Maan Kal Rahayee, Agyani Nar Janat Nahin.
Kabir sahib says here that Our Mind is the God of death and it
is he who resides in all of us and makes us dance to its tunes


Changing the world spiritually 179

## J. Whom should we meditate upon?

Sometime people say that in devotion they gain strength,
never, it is not so. If Soul is in need of anything then it will
attain higher value then the Soul, however it cannot be,
because there is nothing higher than the Soul. Soul is an
essence-part of Parameshwar, it need no external things.
If it is being so, where is the need for devotion and
meditation? Let's see, Soul gains nothing out of devotion
and Meditation. However they can remove the veil and dirt
which has been put on the Soul, and help it experience
itself.
We need to enquire as to on whom we should Meditate.
Meditation is a special thing. On whom so ever we
meditate, we will imbibe their nature and qualities in us.
Just as a seed has potential to manifest as a plant and it
needs to be watered, to germinate. On the other hand if the
seed is kept inside a closed room it cannot spurt even if it is
given plenty of water, since it does not get sunlight.
Everything is in the concentration-Surti. It is enough if it
is activated. There is veil of Mind and Maya on it, because
of that it has become ineffective. It gets awakened with the
concentration (Paras Surti) of Satguru. Therefore, even in
the Sastras they ask one to meditate on Guru (Dhyan
Moolam Guru Roopam), not on Paramatma.
We can meditate on one whom we have seen at some point
in time. The one whom we have not seen, we cannot
meditate on him. Therefore meditation on Paramatma is
not possible, since we have not seen him. Giving up the
confusion we should only meditate on Guru.
Devi Deval Jagat Mey, Kotin Pujat Khoy|
Satguru Ki Puja Kiye, Sabki Puja Hoye||
When we worship a Satguru, we worship the entire
Brahmand. In reality Guru is a messenger of Paramatma.
The scriptures say it beautifully;
Dhyan Moolam Guru Roopam, Pooja Moolam Guru Padhukam.


180 Sahib Bandgi
Mantra Moolam Guru Vakyam, Moksh moolam Guru krupa.
It is not asking you to meditate on Paramatma. It tells
you to meditate on Guru. It says that there is no meditation
greater than the meditation on Guru. It says there no
worship greater then worship of Guru. It says that there is
no mantra greater than words of Guru. It is only the grace
of Guru which can grant Moksh-Salvation. Our scriptures
give such an elevation message. It is not talking about the
grace of Paramatma but grace of guru is given importance.
However the Sayings of Sants are even unique;
Hari Krupa Jo Hoy Toh, Nahi Hoy Toh Naahi|
Kahe Kabir Guru Krupa Bina, Sakal Buddi Bah Jaahi||
It is essential to have the grace of Guru, why so?
Like the ocean, its water is salty. Its water is not
potable. However, if the same water when vaporizes and
rains from the clouds, it becomes useful to all, it becomes
sweet. This water is useful for irrigation. The water is from
the same ocean but the difference is that when it rains from
the clouds it becomes very useful. The water of ocean is
any way not useful, further it incapable of reaching the
needy. Similarly is the Sandalwood tree, it has nice
fragrance, but it is incapable of reaching others on its own.
However the breeze carries that fragrance to father places.
In the same way there is a distinction between the
Supreme Purush and the Guru. Like the water from the rain
is purified water from the ocean, Satguru is the purified
form of Supreme Purusha. In simple words, it is not
possible for the Param Purush to free the beings on his own
(Due to boon of ruler ship given to Niranjan by him).
Therefore he is like the Sandalwood tree, but Satguru is
like the breeze, he takes the light and fragrance of Param
Purus to every place, therefore the Sants did not equate the
Satguru with God but raised his level. Therefore the
importance of meditation on Satguru prescribed.
Guru Ke Sumiran Matra Se, Vinshat Vighna Anant|
Taatey Sarva Rambh Mey, Dhyavat Hey Sab Sant||


Changing the world spiritually 181

Meditation on Sant Satguru grants Adyatmic powers.
Remember not with any tapas or yog one can attain
that. With yog one can attain Divine powers but not
Adyatmic powers. In truth whenever we go to a
Mahapurush or to a sant satguru, we receive Adyatmic
powers in three ways. First we receive through Talk-
Sambhasan. When attending Satsang of a Mahatma and
listen with concentration we receive his power. Just like
the electric current reaches the home from a Pole to the
house through the cable wire, similarly the power of sant
reaches us through his words. Second by sight- Dharshan,
the Adyatmic rays can reach us. When we take salutation-
Bandgi of Sant Satguru we make eye contact with him, this
practice is based on the transmission of Adyatmic power
only. Whenever we go to see a mahatma we try to have his
eye contact, and pray for his auspicious sight on us. If we
fail to make eye contact it means we did not get Dharshan.
Third, through the touch-Sparshan also we can get the
Adyatmic power. Touch any where we will receive it.
However for expressing humility touching of the feet as a
rule is prescribed.
Just the nearness of Mahapurush, we receive all these
powers. Similarly Meditation on Satguru, we receive
Adyatmic powers. If we are unable to take dharsan due to
circumstance, then we should meditate upon him. If
possible one should directly take Dharsan and receive the
adyatmic rays. If it is not possible the alternate is
Meditation.
Meditation is exceptional thing. Longer we meditate
longer we become that. If our concentration is with anger,
we will be in anger for that much time, if it is towards bliss
we will become blissful. Similarly when we meditate on
Satguru, then we also will become like Him. When we
meditate of Satguru, we receive that wonderful power of


182 Sahib Bandgi
Param Purush. Therefore, leaving all confusions we shall
meditate on Satguru.
Dharmdas asked Sahib, How we receive the power of
Param Purush. Sahib told in a sentence all the secret, He
asked to keep the concentration-surti on Satguru, and said
then all will be done by him.

Meditation-Procedure
Atma has Knowledge of desires and Wisdom of that
which is beyond. Knowledge is accrued by observing the
actions and the Societies, it is understood with intellect.
However that innate wisdom present in us is the true
wisdom. Some time there is a surge of wisdom from
within. What is it, that wisdom is present in you? Soul is
the source of that wisdom, it is because Soul is a part of
Param Purush. Some time we like to listen to somebody.
Some reach the very Soul. That which he wanted to know,
no one explained, however such thoughts arise.
'Subki Gatari Laal Hey, Koi Nahi Kangaal|'
That wisdom arises on its own. Some time it arises and
some time remain hidden. This remains complete in
educated, illiterate, Rich and poor, it is only need to be
awakened.
Guru's rays illumine the Heart. Satguru gives his Surti-
Concentration at the time of Naam initiation. However the


Changing the world spiritually 183
disciple need to co-operate Rahani says- 'Naam Satya Guru
Satya, Aap Satya Jo Hoye|' You should also be truthful.
'Vaanpati Jaagsi, Kah Karey Taskara|' If the hose owner is
alert, then what can a robber do! 'Usko Kaal Kya Karey, Jo
Aat Pahar Hoshiyaar|' always be in Surati, alert and watch
quietly; what the Mind is doing. Mind is like a state of
absence of alertness-Ignorance. It will trouble, and give a
sense of weakness. Mind gets irritated. Whenever you sit
for Meditation observes these five things; I am describing
the method.

1. Keep your back straight; Back bone has connection
   with the Brain. When it is straight it helps to open
   Sushmana Nadi. If this remain straight it can open the 10 th
   door (To Heavens).
2. Let the Bhajan (Sumiran-remembrance of Naam)
   continue in the breath; it is just like a bull tied to a pole
   with rope, it cannot run helter scatter. Therefore to bind the
   Mind one should carry on remembrance of Naam,
   Concentrated on Breath. If this sumiran is absent, then
   know that Mind has trapped. This Sumiran-Remembrance
   is to tie the Mind.
   Sumiran Mann Ki Reet Hey, Bhavey Jaha Lagay|
   Bhavey Guru Ki Bhakti Kar, Bhavey Vishay Kamay||
   It cannot be free, just as we open our eye we observe
   something or other. Similarly Mind keeps roaming on
   something or other. Therefore,
   Chinta Toh Guru Naam Ki, Aurr Na Chitavey Daas|
   Jo Kachu Chitavey Naam Binu, Soyi Kaal Ko Phaas||
3. Remain Physically Stable while in Meditation
4. Keep your Watch on Mind; Mind will try to divert
   your concentration on sundry. It knows that if we allowed
   to get concentrated than Soul will realize itself and
   thereafter it will not follow the Mind. Mind is not a sheep
   or Goat to keep a watch on. Mind has four forms. When
   desire arises it is referred to as a Thought. If any desires
   arise know that it is Mind in Thought form. Mind will


184 Sahib Bandgi
indulge us in such thoughts. When desire arises in Mind,
then our concentration will revolve around that. It does it
very cleverly. Take it that Mind creates a desire to build a
House, then the thoughts will be around that, will raise
thoughts on Builder, Bricks and Cement etc. Now what is
the benefit in sitting in meditation? This work is
accomplished by Mind. If you are able to control the desire
then Mind takes other form of thoughts, it will remained
you on some earlier issues. Someone insulted you, it will
take you to that scene. 10 years back some- body said
something enough, it will remain you, and your thought s
will linger.
Manav Toh Daas Dis Phirey, Yah Toh Sumiran Naahi||
Therefore keep a strong watch on Mind; with this you
will understand and benefit on, as to how Mind deludes
you.
Mann Ke Haarey Haar Hey, Mann Ke Jeetey Jeet|
Kahe Kabir Guru Pahiye, Mann Hi Ki Partit||
Always be careful with your Mind, If Chitt-
Consciousness is stopped, then Buddhi-Intellect will start
making resolutions, it is the third form of Mind. Mind
desires that on any way you should not be allowed to go
towards the Soul. If we realize our Soul, then the strength
of mind will be lost because there no other to bind the
Soul. Mind has used the power of the Soul to bind the Soul
itself.
Aapa Ko Aapa Hi Bhandiyo||
Sahib says this Atma has bound itself with its own
power.
Jaise Swaan Kaanch Mandil Mey, Bharmat Bhukh Paryo|
Just as a Dog inside a glass house gives up its life
barking at its own image as another in the mirror. It put up
its own strength on himself. Similarly Atma out of delusion
is destructive.
This way Mind will try to distract through the Body. In
this war the fourth form appears. Some time it will indicate


Changing the world spiritually 185
that the legs have become numb or hands are tired. This
way it will put has in to discomforts. Some time dag will
bark or a mosquito will bite, you will be driven behind that.
Therefore;
Samaj Padey Jab Dhyaan Dharey||
Whatever efforts made for the betterment of the soul are
useless. It is only to realize the self this life is given.
However, we are only focused on bodily needs because we
understand it. There is no opportunity given for realisation
of the Soul. Many have not understood the goodness of the
Soul.
Those who love to travel will keep wandering
aimlessly. One should strive for the betterment of the soul.
Whenever we find time we should engage in Naan Bhajan.
A man asked me, as to when he should do Naam
Bhajan? I told him that he can do it at any time. He
enquired as to the way to do it. I told him that you do not
get the time, even while walking or while lying. However,
you should not do like that of the village accountant's son.
One day a village accountant told me that I have given his
son a license to sleep all the time. He told me that his son
use to sleep a lot since his childhood. Earlier we use to
wake him up, but from the time of Naam dhan we are
unable to wake him up. I asked him for the reason. He told
that whenever he tried to wake him up, his son tell that he
is in meditation.
Earlier I told that Dhyan and bhajan can be done while
laying down, however now I do not say so. I told this only
for those who cannot sit. However young should meditate
while seated. You should do it eagerly. There are no
particular restrictions on sitting posture.
When you sit for meditation, there should be no
movements. If it happens then it is not Dhyan. Sahib has
said very clearly-Mann Ki Tarang Maar Lo, Ho Gaya
_Bhajan....||_ Therefore, one-pointedness of Mind- Ekagrath
is another important aspect of Meditation. You may think,


186 Sahib Bandgi
as to how you will accomplish this. Mind has four forms,
Thought, Intellect, Memory-Consciousness, and Ego.
Elimination of these four is Meditation because what
remains after that is the Soul.
_Mann Ki Tarang Maar Lo, Ho Gaya Bhajan......_
Resolve not to have desires, desire is a form of Mind,
that’s why have no desire. Mind like to delve in to the
desires, but do not follow that. It will ask you to take the
kids to school. Some time it will ask you to go see a
person. It will prompt you to eat something. Sometimes it
will prompt you to do some work. Do not think about
desires when in meditation. Third do not make any
resolutions. When thought arise, you tend to make some
resolution on that, do not do that. Do not take resolutions,
no matter how hard Mind prompts. Surrendering to Guru
means the same. The Fourth do not develop thoughts, here
mind will remind you a lot, and this is work of Chitt-
consciousness. Hold down this Chitt. Do not recollect
anything, meditate only on Satguru. With this your
surrender to Satguru begins. See whether it is the face of
Guru of somebody else. The Fifth, do not engage in any
action, do not move. Sometimes legs will feel tired and
body will ask you to take rest, do not agree.

If you control the thought, then intellect interferes, if you
control Buddhi then Memory- Consciousness intervenes,
some ones face will appear. Their form becomes visible, he
has accused you two months back thought will come and
incite anger, and intellect will start to plan a strategy on
revenge. Just see somany things come from this. You are
disturbed, and the Dhyan is reached somewhere else.
Maanat Nahi Mann Mora Sadho, _Maanat Nahi Mann Morra..._
Mind flows, sometimes on desires and sometime on
imagination. Even for the desires it wants the Soul.
Without the Soul nothing can happen. Chitt also cannot
recollect anything without the Soul. There it is possible to


Changing the world spiritually 187
arrest the Mind without much problem. Activities of mind
are not natural. Without soul nothing can be done.
Breathing does not happen on its own, you do it with your
action, and someone does it. Seated behind the eyes some
being does this work. It is enough if you take care of this
five, your Mind will be under control and your surrender to
Guru happens. Then your Meditation will succeed. While
in meditation, do not resolve to witness something or fly or
Moon or Sun etc. Mind must be caught and finished. This
means destroying the individuality, "I am." When "I am"
dies understand that Mind has died. It is only by ending
this Mind one can enter that world-Amarlok. When the
four aspects of Mind vs. thought, Intellect, Memory and
Ego are not allowed to act then that moment in Mediation
will arrive, for which you meditate.

Surti bandhi asthir karo, guru mein deyi samaye.
Kahein Kabir Dharam Dass se, agam panth lakhaye.
When Dharam Dassji prayed to Sahibji as to how could a
devotee reach there, the latter said that a devotee should fix his
Surti (concentration) at his Satguru.
Satguru will take the devotee to that country by seating him
within himself. Just think! How much wealthy and resourceful a
Satguru is.
Satguru ke lachhan kahoon, achal vihangam chal.
Hum Amrapur le geya, geyan shabad ke nal.
Garib Dassji says that his Satguru has a bird like gait and
that he took him to Amarlok with the power of Naam.


188 Sahib Bandgi

## 10 Devotion to Satguru, How?

## a. Why worship a Satguru.

Why should we worship Guru? What is the need for
serving a Guru? Why can’t we directly worship Param
Purush? Then why is there mention of worship of Satguru?
Shishya Ko Aisa Chahiye, Guru Rijhaye Aapa Khoi.
Understand. That Param Purush is non dual, beyond
Maya and delusion. You cannot perceive his waves. He
can’t make you understand. You too cannot understand
him. Guru is in the limits of Maya, with Mind and has
Senses therefore, he is able to make you understand and
you are able to understand him. He is free of Maya even
while residing within the limits of the Maya. He is residing
in it, thus, he can make you understand correctly but Param
Purush is unable to do that (Being eternal unchanging
Truth). You are not equipped to learn about the devotion
of Param Purush. Therefore, to worship Param Purush is
like throwing stone on the moon. Sahib has even said to
Dharamdas that there is no meaning in the devotion of
Param Purush; you don’t gain anything by it.
Just like you cannot watch Sun with open eyes, darkness
will surround you. However, you can see moon, it’s like
that. The light which moon possesses is that of Sun but it is
more comfortable. Satguru is adequate. That waves are
awakened and aware in Satguru. (Pooja moolam Guru
Padukam).
Satya Purush Ki Aarsi, Santan Keri Deh.
Lakha Jo Chahe Alakh Ko, Inhi Me Lakh Leh.
Therefore, worship of Satguru.

## b. How to worship a Satguru? 4 Sahib Bandgi

The things prohibited by Guru should not be committed.
That is, you should be obedient. Only do those things
which have been approved by your Guru. This is devotion
to Guru, Guru Bhakti.
Gurmukh Laha Le Chale, Manmukh Mool Gavanye.


Changing the world spiritually 189
‘Laha’ refers to rate of interest.
Manmukh Chale Mool Gavanye.
He even loses the principle teachings. It means the
things provided to you by your Guru are lost. Therefore,
practice this in devotion to Guru.

## c. Beware of mind.

You don’t need to go to other places of worship and
persons beside your Satguru. Otherwise, your devotion
would become contaminated (lack of Faith). Only do those
things, which are approved by Satguru. The things
prohibited to you should not be done. Those things which
are forbidden for you are a sign of being controlled by
Mind, therefore understand the direction.

## d. Don’t approach Sayanas-Tantriks.

No matter what the circumstances are, you are never to
approach a sayanas, tantric. No ghost can control you.
They will try only to confuse you. I ask every Sayana in
detail about what do they do? There was a Sayana in
Akhnoor who had connection till Rajauri. Initially, he used
to oppose me, after some time he become devotee. I asked
him what you do. How do you call on dead? He said don’t
ask me this. I said no, I want to know. He replied we have
a team which consists of four people. In that everyone has
the different commission from the total earning. Someone
has 20% share, someone has 30% and some have a share of
40%. In this profession, we have to find customers first
who are not very clever and are innocent to boot. Now we
proceed like this, firstly one of us goes to his house at night
and throws stones at his house from a tree and call for the
said person in ghostly voices. Then when the person comes
out to investigate, he is not able to find anything as he
won’t check on the tree; this will instill some fear in that
person’s heart. Then second day the other one will go and
consume all the milk, now in the morning when the
person’s wife will go for milk to buffalo, the buffalo will
react violently. Now the doubt will increase. Then the third


190 Sahib Bandgi
person will reach that house with some vague manner.
Then he sits there with some excuse. He will say that there
is something wrong with that house. That person’s wife
will reply in affirmative. Now he tells her about a Sayana
who is very compitent, he will give her the address
completely in a very clever way but according to him it
would be vague. That evening when the person comes
home, his wife informs him of the Sayana. Then I the forth
person will act as Sayana and initially he telll them “I don’
have any time” on their enquiry. Then they will says that
their condition is very worse, someone can even die. Then
I go with them. I say that it is the death of Grandmother if
his mother is alive otherwise mother is mentioned. This
thing is dangerous; to solve this expenses are too much.
The person replies he can’t spend so much. Then I make
concession. I note it in a diary. For works like beating the
drum and providing the enchanted threads, I give him the
late night timing. I tell him that nothing can be done for
three to four months. He becomes happy that nothing bad
will happen to him. After that the first person again starts
throwing stones after few months. He said that they never
leave them in the lifetime. He said that sometimes we also
get beaten. Once, one partner of ours didn’t get his
complete share then he told about our plan to the family.
He told them the truth. When next time we went to that
village then the villagers beat us really bad which led to us
running.
Nonetheless, changes are taking place. Now the
Shashtris are changing. Sayanas have converted into the
Shashtris. Roles are changing. Why? It’s because the secret
of Sayanas is in front of people. When I came here, Jagrate
took place frequently. The people have failed them. Then
they changed into Sayanas. Now those Sayanas changed
into Shashtris. Those who consume this type of money
can’t have another one. The lion who consumes the human
flesh would not eat another meat because the human flesh


Changing the world spiritually 191
is delicious. Just like that those Sayanas can’t earn from it.
Therefore, the people who did jagarata became Sayanas.
Then the similar team got converted into Sayanas. The
Shashtris are also involved in the work of spirits and
ghosts.
The Naam given to you will chase away all the ghosts.
This Naam even takes care of 14 messengers of Yama who
are residing within you, therefore even the outer ghosts
don’t stand a chance.
Adhut Naam Sada Rakhvala.
People are not observing these things. If a lady doesn’t
have grandchild in two years then she takes her daughter in
law to Sayanas. Their limit of ignorance is such that a lady
went to a Sayana after she cut her hand with knife while
cutting vegetables, she said that her neighbor has done
something to her who is a Dayan. Someone should tell that
lady to go to the doctor for the treatment for the bleeding
hand.
Someone said that his buffalo has gone sick. It is an
external problem. I asked him whether he has taken Naam.
He replied yes. I asked him then why are you having
doubt? He said that Sayana says you have taken Naam not
the buffalo. I replied of course he would say that. Then
once a lady’s child became ill and the other people began
talking that it is due to an external cause. I asked, have you
taken Naam. She replied yes. She further said that they say
that you have taken Naam not your child. Spirit is on the
child. They do this so that you will fail in pure devotion.
That’s why they confuse you with their play. Therefore,
when I saw these people in these webs, I thought why I
don’t start from here. The deep and stringed devotion can
be tackled later. I made them understand that ghosts can’t
take them. When you take Naam then Sahib also protects
you.
Sahib says-
Bhoot Pishach Hoye Sab Niyara, Adbhut Naam Sada Rakhrava.


192 Sahib Bandgi
Someone said, that you are asking not to believe in ghosts
and spirits. Then what about our ancestors? What will
happen to them? Where will they go? They ask for things,
if we don’t give them then where would they go? I told
them there is medication for that also.
Tarun Tas Ikhatar Bansha.
Your 71 generations will qualify for Salvation-Mukti. Just
as you get the power of Naam, your ancestors are being
librated from world of life and death_. .........._ therefore
Naam protects.
Sahib says-
Satguru Shabd Sahai.
Nikat Gaye Tan Rog Na Vyape, Pap Tap Mit Jai.
Jadu Yantra Jukti Na Lage, Shabd Ke Ban Dahai.
Ojha Dayan Ur Dar Darpe, Jehar Jud Ho Jai.
Kahain Kabir Katun Yyam Phansa, Sukrit Lakh Duhai.
So you get a great power after Naam Dhaan. Initially
when people came to me they didn’t came with enlightened
knowledge. The ghost was pulling some and others had
some other problem. When he began to get better, I started
telling him about the spirituality. They began to have faith
that there is something. Slowly, I began to teach them the
lesson of spirituality. I didn’t change anybody’s Religion.
We are not against any Religion. We are saying that with
the worship of Satguru, it amounts to the worshipping of
whole universe.
Devi dewal jagat mein, kotik poojey koye.
Satguru ki pooja kiye, sabb ki pooja hoye.
We are saying that if spirits disturbs it won’t happen
after Naam Dhaan. We are not denying the fact of pittar.
They even have demands. However, all these are in the
limits of the three loks. We are saying that there is a forth
lok. That is the world of Souls, Amar lok.
When the human being spins in the ghosts then three
loks are a big thing, so are the inner worlds. If Anthill
grows in the house then they say that this is a deity.
Everyone bows down to that Anthill. They say that you


Changing the world spiritually 193
will be prosperous with his blessing. It’s not you who
become prosperous, it’s the person who makes an idiot of
other people and takes away all their wealth.
I saw a girl. She used to say that deity comes in to her. I
told her to sit. I told one person to get hold of her. She was
being clever. About 99% of these types of people are the
clever ones. She used to go back while shivering. When we
go deeper into these types of things then it comes out be an
act most of the time. Then while backing off herself, she
used to see back cleverly that assures she wouldn’t get hit
on the wall or something else which could result in her
getting hurt. Then she fell forward with a very dramatic
style. One fall is dramatic while the other one is sudden
which can even cause some serious damage to the head. I
warned her about falling once again. There is no ghost or
spirit here. No ghost can enter the threshold of Ashram.
Initially, when I used to do Satsang then 5-6 ladies used to
go onto their death stance. There are three measures which
are taken by them. Firstly, they shout and then they make
horrifying faces. Lastly, they began to shake their heads. I
tolerated this in the starting. I thought it was a growing
disease. I selected 2- 3 strong girls and told them to hold
them tightly by their hairs of those who do these types of
things. After that no one tried to act like that anymore.
Therefore, we are saying that with the Naam Dhaan you
will get rid of ghosts and also the ancestors will transcend
this Bhavasagar. We are not in conflict with Shiv ji or
Hanuman ji. We are not Kansh who is at war with Krishna
ji and I am also not Ravan who is at war with Ram ji.
These are the tales made by people.
There was a lady who had faith in me but she had not
taken Naam Dhaan. She was a devotee. Just like the men
are awakened, ladies are also awakened. Just like males are
trouble, females are good at causing trouble. So that lady
said whenever any work comes to a final stage there would
arise some trouble and the work couldn’t complete. These


194 Sahib Bandgi
types of powers were also behind our ancestors. Similar
thing happened with my grandfather, I saw this with my
father, and now this is happening to me. Every work
disrupts at the final stage. She asked me to investigate into
this matter. When I went into depth I saw that there was a
person. In olden times when something fell into the well
then a cat was led to descend into the well with the help of
a rope to find the thing. The rope is tied with the help of
certain rings and it is rotated so that the fallen item can get
trapped inside it. I did the same thing and caught the
culprit. There was a man in no form. I caught him and
asked him what did you do? He said that I sit in their mind
and disrupts whole work. Therefore, the others didn’t even
know what the reason was.
The lady used to say that even when there is not a
conflicting environment there used to be fights in the
house. I asked that person why was he disturbing their
works. Why are you causing them losses? He replied that I
am after this family for 400 years. I am in ghost form.
Ghosts meet us in three ways. The first one come
directly in front of you, the second one comes in thoughts
and the third one pressure one in their sleep. Those who
come in thoughts will feel like there is someone. He said
that I am destroying them in this form. I asked him what
the reason was. He replied that their ancestors killed me.
My family got wiped out.
In the old times no one wanted to have their families
wiped out from the face of earth. Suppose there are two
sons of Mohanlal. Even if the one of them has a child, the
family will carry on. However, if none of them have a child
then the family name does not carried forward. He wanted
to have his family name going. The last shradh is done for
those who are forgotten. It’s just like we have to send a
card, and caught up with someone then card is provided to
him also. This is how it works out.


Changing the world spiritually 195
He said that I could not get release; I want to wipe out
their clan. I was almost successful in completing my task.
Now there is a hindrance. From the time they have come
into your shelter I am unable to do anything.
I made that lady understand that those who are
connected to me by Surti won’t get affected by this.
This is the truth, after Naam I have secured you. Despite
being misguided and troubled people kept on joining our
panth increasing day by day. Means there is power in
Naam. Because the Naami realizes that there is some
internal power residing within him.
Therefore, he said that now there is hindrance. I was so
close to my goal but now I can’t even reach, it because
those who are connected to you are unreachable to me.
You witness that after Naam Dhaan you are much
secured. There is armor for you. You feel that you are
secure and there is an internal power providing protection
to you, even ghosts are not able to reach you.
There is a basis for your faith. You are finding yourself
safe. When you wear bulletproof shield no bullet can harm
you. Just like that no mantra, magic or planets, stars can
hurt you. Hence, you become fierce in your faith. By
witnessing your rigidness, the others think that you have
changed your religion. We are talking about pure religion.
We are walking on the path of truth and non- violence. We
have cleared our doubts, we do not believe in voodoo and
Stars-planets. These things are very less but the phonies’
take their help to carry out their own needs. If an animal
falls sick then they say that it is due to a ghost. When the
lady replies that she has taken Naam then they say that the
buffalo has not taken Naam. Means they make idiot of you.
I never told anyone to do this thing or that. Whenever some
victim arrive, I made them understand that it is not because
ghosts or voodoo. I told them they don’t have any chance
in front of Naam. We do not make people leave their
religion, we have only make people leave their doubts.


196 Sahib Bandgi
However, the phonies are entangling people in this. Sahib
says- Ye Keval Bhram Ke Utpati.
They earn money by confusing you. This community is
very dangerous. They entangle you for money.
Therefore, from the time you have taken Naam they cannot
affect you. You must have tested it. You must have
experienced at many points.
He was after them for 400 years. He said he cannot
finish his work now. Those who are connected to you are
not within my limits. At the time of my death I decided on
my revenge. My aim was to finish their family name due to
which I wasn’t able to cross over from spirit.
That lady’s doubt was true. Soul is present in
everybody. It has the sense of right and wrong. All this are
the act of Surti. Mind is playing with this Surti. He is
heading it towards the wrong direction. However, it is
unable to do so after Naam. Naam Hoye To Math Namave.
......so it can only be protected with the power of Naam.

## e. No to Astrologers.

Never approach any astrologer at the time of birth,
marriage or for any other reason. You don’t need all that.
Stars and planets have no effect on you now. Because-
Nav Grah Ke Bas Chalai, Sabhi Vighn Sada Tal Jai.
After Naam not even the nine planets would be able to
harm you.
We are telling you not to believe in planets and stars.
This is 99% fraud. In 200 3 , Mr. Vajpayee was the prime
minister of India and the elections were around the corner.
Around 200 astrologers foretold that he would be re-
elected as the Prime Minister but the one who got the post
was Mr. Manmohan Singh. No one had seen that. Those
were highly educated Astrologers but even their reading
was not correct. If their condition is like this then what
level are the other minor ones are. They are just scaring
people in the name of stars. Our principles are finishing


Changing the world spiritually 197
them. We don’t want anything from Sani dev. We are just
telling you to keep the faith and be strong in devotion.

## f. Don’t bow at other places.

Why is this? This is not a bad thing but this is a Sagun
bhakti and I have given you the Naam of Satya- bhakti
which is beyond even Nirgun bhakti. Before marriage, girls
plays with the dolls but after marriage they don’t play, do
they? Temples are there to instill the devotion inside you. It
is all right still you haven’t got complete Guru but when
you have get complete Guru then you should leave it. Now
you have to raise yourself on the higher steps of devotion
to Satguru. Then by the worship of Satguru, prayer to the
universe is complete.
Devi Deval Jagat Me, Kotin Puje Koye.
Satguru Ki Puja Kiye, Sabki Puja Hoye.
And-
Kotin Teerth Bhram Bhram Aave,
So Fal Guru Ke Charanan Pave.
Otherwise with this deed the devotion will get
contaminated. If someone takes you with force even then
don’t worry, just keep Satguru in your heart but don’t offer
any money or offerings there.

## g. Don’t make Contribution.

Never contribute or provide money to the beggars.
Except at the feet of Guru you don’t have to pay money or
offerings elsewhere. This was prohibited because if the
money provided by you is used in wrong and unfair deeds
then the one at fault are also you. Hence, be careful. You
should avoid these two.

Other Things

1. Never take leftover food, remains of tether’s food.
   Because with Naam you are now a Mahatma. You are
   celestial Swan, Hansa. A Hansa never approach a dirty
   place and never consume any orts. Those who don’t have
   Naam can’t be Pure.
   Unch Vahi Jo Naam Hai Jana, Bina Naam Sab Nich Bakhana.


198 Sahib Bandgi
Whom so ever ort you will consume, his character will
come into you. So beware.

2. At a house where meat is cooked never eat food. If you
   can help it, don’t even drink water there. The remnants still
   remain in the utensils after washing (Patra Suddhi).
3. Do not take Prasad from any one or places
4. With Naam even your Ancestors cross life and death so
   don’t worry about them. There is no need for Shraddh. One
   year of this world is equal to their one day. Those who get
   Naam, their 71 past generations are released from Birth
   and Death, attain param Moksh. Therefore nothing needs
   to be done. You should also pay attention to the fact that
   Pitrus are not worshipped. Vasudev Krishna taught Arjun
   that you need not worship Deities, Ancestors or Spirits;
   you only need to keep faith in me. It was because he was
   Guru for Arjun. Therefore, no matter where your ancestor
   are gone, heaven or are wandering as ghosts don’t worry
   about them. Then those who have gone after taking Naam
   Dhaan those are in the Amar lok. In that place they don’t
   feel any hunger or thirst so don’t worry about their Meal
   time. Otherwise it will become the devotion of Ancestors.
   So concentrate on your Satguru.
5. The deeds like fasting and other festivals which are
   related to Kal Niranjan or outer devotions, you need not
   observe such things. Poornima vrat of Satguru can be done.
6. Do not do or participate in any rituals, pooja or yagya
   etc. Otherwise your Concentration will suffer. Now don’t
   have to indulge your mind in anything else other than
   Satguru Bhakti. You should not concentrate on any other
   place. You should not commit such a deed which would
   result in your devotion being contaminated and which
   makes your Satguru sad.
7. No need to perform rituals for peace in the home. You
   need not pray for fulfillment of wishes at other places. If
   you have made a wish before Naam Dhaan then you need
   not to complete it now (Virat, Yagya, Recitations etc), as


Changing the world spiritually 199
all the previous consequences of deeds are cut down with
Naam. We are not in conflict with any deity, we are just
saying so that your faith and concentration should be on
one only, it should not be scattered which can unsettle you.
Only then you will have deep concentration and devotion
to Satguru, then you can easily attain Satlok.
I have gone to many pilgrimages centers. Wherever I
have gone I have talked to them. What is happening there
and what are their customs that’s why I visit those religious
places. I have complete knowledge of Shashtras. I have
studied them all. You wouldn’t have read them. So keep in
mind that we are not at conflict with anyone but these
things can’t liberate your Soul and your concentration
would wander distract worship hence, I am moving you
around me. This is a single mind so it should be focused on
one thing.

8. It summarizes that don’t worship anything else other
   than your Satguru. Never commit a deed which includes
   other forms of devotion or which contaminates your
   devotion. Otherwise your mind will drag in two directions
   and you will remain entangle in the world of Kal Purush.
   Have complete faith on Satguru. If you are indulge in other
   Bhakti then that means you don’t have faith in your Guru.
   Therefore, for this remain in devotion and be honest
   towards the Guru, we have to be cautious of these things
   otherwise we do not deserve his grace. All of these are Ok
   at other places. You have to reach the high pedestal of
   Satguru Bhakti. This is a new life and you don’t have any
   other support other than Satguru. All that you did before
   you have to forget. No one will cause trouble for you.
   Whatever you did before, forget about it. No one can harm
   you. The Disciple should never go the other places but to
   Satguru no matter how bad the conditions become.
   Sukh Me Tujhe Na Bhulun, Dukh Me Na Har Manu.
   Aisa Prabhav Bhar De, Mere Adhir Man Me.
   This is for you own benefit.


200 Sahib Bandgi

Becoming a Gurumukh (Guru Centric)
Now how to become a Gurumukh? Dharamdas ji asked
Sahib, how a Gurumukh could be identified. Sahib said-
Jab Lag Tan Me Hans Rahai, Nirkhe Shabd Antai Nahin Jai.
Means for the time you have got breathe in your body,
never disobey your Guru’s words.
Guru Agya Nirkhat Rahe, Jaise Manihin Bhujang.
Pay close attention to words of Guru. ‘Bhujang’ refers to
snake. His all concentration is always on that Mani-Gem.
Whenever it heads out to in search of food and it has to
keep Mani outside, even then his whole attention is on the
Mani. It never wavers.
Kahain Kabir Dharamdas Se, Yeh Gurumukh Ko Ang.
This is being Gurumukh. This lightens the heart and
destroys the ills of intellects. Guru Nanak dev ji says-
Shabdhi Seve So Gurumukh Hoi.
The first thing is that which I told you? Whatever words
were spoken, not for my benefit? Whom do they benefit? It
is for you only.
If someone is lying 50 times in a day and saying he is a
devotee then that is making fun of devotion. He will not be
worthy in your eyes also. Secondly, the one who consume
alcohols and uses drugs, his value will also decrease in
your eyes. The one who is leaving his wife for another
woman, you can’t have a better opinion about him. The
one who gamble will appear idle in your eyes every time.
Those who are cheating or commit treachery, they will also
don’t have any value in your eyes. The one who is killing
other beings can’t have a place in your heart.
All these are the shortcomings. To get rid of them, you
have been told to not commit those things. These are not
correct. Why because then you will worth nothing. Right
now as a Naami, you are very worthy.
Sometime circumstances arise when you feel like
whatever Guru is saying is not correct and what my mind is
telling me is correct. No, don’t do it. Whenever you will


Changing the world spiritually 201
use mind, it will only bounce you back in to the world. So,
bow down to Guru, don’t use your own intellect before
him.
Naam Satya Guru Satya Ho, Aap Satya Jo Hoye.
Teen Satya Jab Ek Ho, Vish Se Amrit Hoye.
What is this third type of truth? Whatever your Guru
says, follow him. Never use your own intelligence and
don’t follow your mind. Always follow Guru.
Khaki Ho Guru Key Charan Me, To Tujhe Manjil Mil.
Don’t think that whatever you are doing is correct.
Mujhe Hai Kam Satguru Se, Duniya Ruthe To Ruthan De.
Sometimes situation arises when the whole world seems
to work fine but Guru doesn’t, even then, follow Guru. A
Mahapurush doesn’t flow with the stream of world. He is
outside that flow. He is outside limits of Maya and Mind.
So follow him. Then Victory is in your hand.
If the world tells you to bow at a place, then don’t. Even
if someone gets angry with you for that then let them be.
(Tell them that you’r following the words of your Guru, do
not argue)
Guru Agya Le Aavhi, Guru Agya Le Jaye.
Kahain Kabir Va Das Fir, Bahu Vidhi Amrit Paye.
There is nothing greater than the command of Guru.
Those who are following it are Gurumukh.
Guru Agya Le Aavhi, Guru Agya Le Jaye.
This is devotion to Guru.
Guru Bhakti Atal Aman Adol Dharman, Yeh Saras Duja Nahin.
Jap Yog Vrat Tap Dan Puja, Trin Sdrish Yeh Jag Kahi.
Pilgrims are like straws in front of Devotion of Satguru.
Then, you have to serve him with body, mind and wealth.
This is the importance of the Satguru Bhakti. Sahib says-
Guru Seva Jo Kare Subhaga, Janm Janm Ka Patak Bhaja.
Your all sins will be erased. Furthermore,
Guru Seva Se Hriday Prakashe.
The heart will illumin.
Durmati Bhaje Patak Nashe.


202 Sahib Bandgi
Sins will be erased. ‘Subhaga’ refers to ones who are
blessed. Service to the Satguru means success. This would
be done by three ways.
At one place, Sahib mentions four religion of the pupil. A
follower should have four Dharma.
First- Tan Man Dhan Se Guru Ki Seva.
It is because service to Guru helps one reach the Param
Tatva- reality (Serve the organization). Therefore, it is
mentioned in the Shashtras, the service of Guru.
If you want to make a place for yourself in the heart of
your Guru then do it by serving him, otherwise you
wouldn’t be able to. Nanak dev ji says-
Suseva Bas Sahiba.
Sahib says-
Namvant Bahute Mile, Dhyanvant Anek.
Kahain Kabir Dharamdas Se, Guruvanta Koi Ek.
There are many who are in remembersence of Naam, many who
meditate. However the rare one is in sevice of his Guru, tells
Sahib to Dharmdas.
Secondly, Seva Me Vishay Ko Tyage.
It means sacrifise all tendences in seva. It is not proper if
one play mischief whole day in bad deeds and then he
claims that he is a devotee. His lifestyle and conduct
should be simple and good.
Thirdly, Man Me Ahankar Na Aane.
There shouldn’t be proud in service.
Fourthly, Guru Ke Shabd Pratiti.
Sahib says-
Guru Agya Le Aavhi, Guru Agya Le Jahin.
Kahain Kabir Ta Das Ko, Teen Lok Dar Nahin.
Guru Samrath Jehi Sam Hade, Kami Kahu Ko Das.
Ridhi Sidhi Seva Kare, Mukti Na Chhade Sathe.
That’s where faith comes in action. These four Dharma
should be in a pupil. From four of them, two are of great
importance.
Guru Seva Baki Nischay Kar.
Serving the Guru and then faith in the words of Guru.


Changing the world spiritually 203
Jo Koi Gahe Chale Yam Jeeti.
Those who win over these two will be able to cross
Sansar Sagar and reach their destination, Amarlok.
Guru Shishya Aur Ishvar, Mil Kina Bhakti Vivek.
Teeno Trichara Bani, Aage Ganga Ek.
Guru Samana Shishya Me, Shishya Liya Kar Neh.
Bilgaye Bilge Nahin, Ek Roop Do Deh.
Sahib even said-
Guru Ka Kathan Man Sab Lije, Satya Asatys Vichar Na Kije.
He is saying, follow every instruction of Guru. Don’t use
your own intelligence to judge whether it is right or wrong.
Just as for the farming, the soil should be best and farmer
should have the proper knowledge. Similarly, after Naam
Dhan pupil should be at his best.
Khelna Ho To Kheliye, Pakka Hokar Khel.
Kachi Sarson Per Ke, Khadi Bhaya Na Tel.

Attend Satsang
The time, for which you sit in Satsang, it comes under
devotion to Guru. This is even greater than Dhyan-
concentration and Bhajan. Devotion can’t be obtained
without Satsang. Goswami ji says-
Bhakti Swantar Sakal Gun Khani,
Binu Satsang Na Pavat Prani.
Bhakti Nirupan Vividh Vidhana,
Kshma Sat Sheel Nidhana.
Devotion is that which bears the fruit of virtue. Now
what is Satsang? We think that listening to stories is
Satsang. Stories are events that have passed. Sahib says-
Mala Lakkad Puja Pathar, Tirth Hai Sab Pani.
Kahain Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Charo Ved Kahani.
Satsang is related to heart. A tale is with Mind. A Story
telling can be done by anyone. It is memorised and then
told to others. However, Satsang provides you the
Devotion.
Firstly, let’s understand the meaning of the word
Devotion. It means the erasing of your senses. Sahib says
no one is able to do that.


204 Sahib Bandgi
Chaudah Lok Base Bhag Mahi, Bhag Se Kou Nyara Nahin.
No one is beyond them.
Gyan Chadriya Jisne Lini, Maili Kar Dhar Dini.
Ek Kabira Jatan Se Lini, Jyon Ki Tyon Dhar Dini.
Chadriya Jhini Re Jhini.
You must have witnessed that people while giving
Satsang become emotional, they began to cry but a
Mahapurush doesn’t do that. Because
_Man Hi Rove, Man Hi Gave...._
Sahib says- Bahar Na Dikhlaye, Andar Kijiye Het.
This all is the work of mind. This is not devotion. To
ring bells is not devotion. This is the act of Kal. Those who
act outwardly and do things like that to show their
devotions are not true devotees. Sahib says this is not
devotion.
So the one who is guiding you should be tested whether
they have attained God or they are just telling you from the
Books they have read. Otherwise he is not a complete
Guru, a Satguru. A complete Guru keeps himself far away
from sex and married life, on attaining complete awareness
of truth, he will give up all that (If not a Celibate). Being in
the company of such Guru and developing devotion is
known as Satsang. A moment with such a Sant in devotion
is called Satsang, it is said-
Sat Swag Au Apvarg, Dharaun Tula Ik Ang.
Tahi Sakal Mil Nahin Tule, Je Kshan Lau Satsang.
Satsang provides you with three things. Its three
advantages are-
Satsang Resolves The Doubts.
Firstly, Satsang provides you the solution to the doubts.
Whenever we listen to a Mahapurush, we receive
Adyatmic Wisdom from their pure Intellect. You will get
your answers. There is difference between Satsang and
Storytelling. In a tale, the stories of Vedas and Shashtras
are told. These are the explanations. We are not denying
their place. Mahapurush talk about Atam- tatva. Hence,


Changing the world spiritually 205
Satsang solves all the doubts. It removes the darkness from
the heart.
Satsang Helps to Concentrate
In the presence of Mahapurush, the whole environment
becomes concentrated. He neither grows his hair long nor
does he wear colored clothes (No physical symbolism).
Maan Na Rangaye Yogi, Kapda Rangaye Liya.
A worldly man’s Surti is wandering in this world. By
visiting a Mahapurush, the Surti- Concentration becomes
focused (One Pointed) and he is awakened.
Satsang Charges you with Spiritual powers
Thirdly, a spiritual rays emanates from Satguru’s Body,
which is receive. When we listen to them, we receive their
rays which increases the Adyatmic powers in us.
The energy which is emitted from Mahapurush fills the
environment. Even science affirms that rays emit from
humans.
If someone arrives in your home, then his rays remains
and reflects in the house for many days. You have intuition
that let you know who is going to arrive.
Sometimes you are thinking about someone and then
the person you thought arrives. Those rays reach you
before that person arrives. You can experience it. When
these Spiritual rays of Mahapurush reach the bodies they
help you understand your own identity, your own base.
Kabir Sangat Sadhu Ki, Jyon Gandi Ki Bas.
Jo Gandi Kuchh Det Nahin, To Bhi Bas Suvas.
The power provided by these Mahapurush is more than
the power that you get from deep devotion. When the
Naam Diksha is given then we receive the power of Naam.
After that one experience elevating life.
.......these rays from the Mahapurush blesses with calmness
and peace.
Scientists say that there is power in the flower of rose, it
rejuvenates you, provide you the power. Nehru ji used to
keep rose with him. Whenever he entered a garden he


206 Sahib Bandgi
experienced a calmness. Similarly, these Spiritual powers
provide you peace and calmness. Hence, there is profit
from the auspicious sight of Mahapurush.
Kabira Man Panchhi Bhaya, Ud Ke Chala Akash.
Swarg Lok Khali Pada, Sahib Santan Pas.
Ramayana says-
Nahin Dridra Sam Dukh Jam Aana
Sant Milan Sam Sukh Nahin Jana.
Hence, faith and self-esteem will increase in the Satsang
of Mahapurush, the Soul in us becomes receptive. Hence,
Mahapurush wants you to listen to Satsang. Therefore,
Guru must be selected by taking few things into
consideration, Satsang. But he shouldn't be tested after that.
Initially, you are independent, solve your doubts. That’s
why Satsang is a way to solve your doubts.
Auspicious Sight-Dhahran of Satguru Always

Guru Ka Darshan Kijiye, Din Me Kai Kai Bar.
Asuya Ka Meh Jyon, Bahut Kare Upkar.
What is in the pure cloud? When a drop of Swati falls in
the stomach of the shell, it turns into a pearl. When that
same drop falls into a bamboo Then it is called
'banslochan', when the drop fell onto a stone, it becomes
'Paras', when it falls in the ear of an elephant then it
becomes 'Gajmukta' and when it fell into a Banana it
becomes 'karpur'. So it has many profits. Therefore, the
sight of a complete Guru is incredible.
To have Dharsan of your Guru is the Guru Bhakti. It has
its importance. Hence, you are asked to have Dharsan of
Satguru once or twice in a day or many more times if you
can. So why is there so much importance Dharsan? What
do we get from it? Let’s see.
A human has three types of powers Bhowtik - Elements,
Divik- Divine and Adyatmik- Spiritual Powers. From the
materialistic perception, human is a very efficient being.
The earth has been decorated with these powers only. It has


Changing the world spiritually 207
been used to create incredible things. Our children
complete our incomplete works, similarly, God has created
the earth moon, sun, stars, water, mountains etc., but it has
been then rejuvenated and decorated by the humen only.
He made Roads by cutting through the Mountains, Houses
were constructed and in some places tall Buildings too. All
of these were not created by the God. Then there is
Telephone, Airplanes and what not. These were created by
the human not by the God in the sky. Behind all this there
is a power of elements with man. However, this power of
elements has limits. If someone thinks that he can will
some things to fly, he cannot, he has so such powers, and it
will do the work for which it is made. Our eyes have vision
till a certain limit. After that distance we are unable to see
clearly. Our ears also have a limit, one kilometer distance,
even if someone is shouts no one can hear it. Therefore,
these physical powers have a limit. Still it carries out big
deeds.
Then above them there are Divine powers. These are
also within the humans, but humans are unaware of them.
They are situated on five places in our body. Common man
is unaware of these powers and doesn't use them. If we do
not use a thing for a long period of time, it ceases to work
properly. If we don't use a vehicle for some time then its
machinery begins to stop working properly, it can't
function properly after that. Similarly, the humans have not
used these powers and now these are in hibernation, they
are not awakened.
Yogis awaken these powers with the help of yoga,
therefore they are powerful than ordinary human. Some
yogis awaken their powers by concentrating in the middle
of the eye and they become powerful than others. An
ordinary human cannot look at such yogi in to his eyes
because that part of the brain illuminates. Then some
obtain these powers by concentrating on the Agyachkra.


208 Sahib Bandgi
Others stabilize their concentration in the Banknaal, where
they listen to the various sounds and obtain Sidhi powers.
Then, there comes the spiritual powers. These also reside
within a human but he can't accessed them by themselves.
Bin Satguru Pave Nahin, Koi Kotin Kare Upaye.
Thus, the treasure of these spiritual powers are manifested
only in the Sants and Satguru. So without the grace of Sant
Satguru you can't obtain these spiritual powers.
An infant's energy source is, breast feeding. Just like that
Guru is a source. His concentration is source of energy.
This is the easy way. Even if you don't do any deep
devotion, you will be transformed.
A person came from army and said I was a very bad human
before, I used to start beating anyone anytime, but now I
have changed and I am not even aware of this
transformation. I told him this thing.
Me: this is the power of concentration/meditation.
He: I have never meditated.
Me: this is the power of Naam.
He: I haven't done it.
Me: this is the deed of Satsang.
He: I don't listen to Satsang.
Me: this is the power of Dharsan.
He: yes, I have Dharsan of you a lot.
This was the truth, I didn't want to say it beforehand, but in
the end I had to say it. Auspicious Sighting of Satguru
provides a great deal of energy. Meditation is done as an
option for Dharsan.
When we go to Sants, this spiritual energy is obtained by
three methods:-
By Auspicious Sight: Dharsan; firstly, when the Guru
looks at us then it sends energy in to us. That’s why when
we go to Guru we pray them to keep auspicious sight on
us. Gadhari had made the Duryodhan's body frigid with her
power of sight only. Means sight can play with the Divine
powers then why not with the Spiritual powers.


Changing the world spiritually 209
By Touch of his Holy feet: Parshan ; this energy could
also be possessed by the touch. This can be done by
touching anywhere but touching feet has somehow become
a rule.
By Sound: Sambhasan; then the other method to reach
these rays towards us is sound. Hence, the Satsang has a lot
of importance. Dhanya Ghadi Jab Ho Satsanga.
You must have listened that a rishi urged someone and
incinerated him. Means sound controlled the Divine
powers. Similar is the case with the Spiritual powers.
Due to these reasons, Guru’s Dharsan hold so much
importance. Whenever Guru is nearby, you should have
Dharsan of him again and again. So Sahib says-
Kai Bar Na Hoi Sake, Doye Waqt Kar Lei.
Satguru Darshan Kekiye, Kaal Daga Nahi Dei.
He says that you should sight Guru Minimum two times a
day. But even that it is not possible then Sahib says-
Doye Waqt Na Ho Sake,Din Me Karai Ik Bar.
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye,Utre Bhavjal Par.
He is saying that then do it once in a day.it will cross
you over this world. If we don't eat in a day then we feel
weakness, similarly, if we eat the next day then the
weakness vanishes away. The food is a source of energy.
So, Sahib says-
Ek Dina Na Kari Sake, Duje Din Kari Lehi.
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Pave Uttam Dehi.
But if Guru is far away then there is an option for that too-
Duje Din Na Kar Sake, Chauthe Din Kar Jaye
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Moksh Mukti Phal Paye.
He is saying then do it in four days, you will be worthy
of moksh. If you don't feed yourself for three days then
there would be weakness but even if you eat at the fourth
day then your energy will be sufficed. So similarly, the
mind will broaden but after that with energy it will reduce
to its original size. The veil that has fallen on the mind and
maya needs energy to unveil itself. So we should obtain


210 Sahib Bandgi
this energy from the auspicious sight of Guru from time to
time. But even if that is not even possible, Guru is very far
away then what. Sahib has also given the solution to this-
Chauthe Din Nahin Kar Sakae, Ar Bar Karu Jaye.
Yame Vilamb Na Kijiye, Kahai Kabir Samujhaye.
Now here Sahib is cautioning you.it is said that if
possible then Have Dharsan of your Guru, at least one
week. Don’t put it away otherwise, the Soul will rust and
the power of Mind will increase and the control of the
mind over the Soul will increase. Spiritual power is
responsible for the un-veiling of control of mind over the
Soul so the Dharsan of Guru should be taken again and
again. As many times you can. There could be many
hindrances in this task but you have to overpower them all.
Sahib says-
Mata Pita Sut Istri, Bandhu Kutamb Ko Jan.
Guru Darshan Ko Jab Chale, Ye Atkave Aan.
Unka Atka Na Rahe, Guru Darshan Ko Jaye.
Kahai Kabir So Sant Jan, Moksh Mukti Phal Jaye.
These will create hindrances in your path, but don't let
them stop, because you need to recharge that energy.
A tree obtain energy from the soil but still it needs the
energy of the Sun for proper nutrition and to grow
properly. Similarly, a human with the powers can't
transcend this world without the Spiritual powers which
can only be obtained by the Satguru. So that's why the
Dharsan of the Guru is necessary always. Sahib says-
Abhin Nahin Guru Kai Bacha, Abhin Kachha Re Kacha.
Kahin Gupt Kahin Pargat Hove, Gokul Mathura Kashi.
Pavan Chadave Sidh Kahave, Hoye Surya Lok A Vasi.
Tabhun Nahin Guru Kai Bacha, Abhin Kachha Re Kacha.
Sahib is saying that even if you obtain so much powers
that you can teleport to anywhere, like from Jammu to
Kashi or from Mathura to Kailash, even then you have not
obtained the Adyatmic powers. You have not received that
source of strength, therefore,
Abhin Kachha Re Kacha.


Changing the world spiritually 211
Untill he has not received the fundamental Spiritual
energy (Mool Urja) from the Satguru, he is incomplete.
Furthermore,
Kari Asnan Bhahut Chadave, Brahm Agni Udgare Ga.
Jal Ke Upar Asan Mare, Jo Bolai So Hovega.
Tabhun Nahin Guru Kai Bacha, Abhin Kachha Re Kacha.
Even if one obtain such power that your words becomes
true, even than he is not complete. He is still incomplete.
Jo Koi Kahe Avinashi, Jyoti Swaroop Lakhavega.
Ved Vividh Ke Marg Chhane, Tan Lakkad Kari Darega.
Tabhun Nahin Guru Kai Bacha, Abhin Kacha Re Kacha.
Even if one has the knowledge of the four Vedas, and by
devotion make his body like wood even then Sahib says
that he is not complete. Even then ' kacha re kacha'. Then,
he says-
Jogi Hoyake Jog Kamavae, Rom Rom Kari Chhanega.
Teen Lok Me Kachhu Na Chhode, Pura Jog Kamavega.
Tabhun Nahin Guru Ai Bacha, Abhin Kacha Re Kacha.
It does not matter how much Yog one can do. Even if he
attains the Siddhi power so strong that he can reach
anywhere in three loks. Still he is unripe.
Tabhun Nahin Guru Kai Bacha, Abhinkacha Re Kacha.
Furthermore,
Ek Shunya Ko Kaun Kahave, Sat Shunya Le Javega.
Mahashunya Par Asan Mare, Saham Ka Ghar Pavega.
Tabhun Nahin Guru Kai Bacha, Abhin Kacha Re Kacha.
Even if someone reach Mahashunya which is above
Shunya, obtain Soham, still he is incomplete. So even
after all this he is still incomplete. Why? Because you have
not obtained the fundamental Spiritual energy from the
Satguru. That’s why-
Jog Bhog Se Nayara Hove, Nih Akshar Nahin Bhavega.
Had Behad Ajpa Se Bhage, Nij Swaroop Ko Pavega.
Ab Bhaya Re Guru Kai Bacha, Ab Pakka Re Pakka.
Kahain Kabir Thehar Pad Ane, Jo Teen Kaal Nahin Nasat.
Naam Roop Yash Joda Bahutai, Parkhat Chhute Sansat.
Ab Bhaya Re Guru Ke Bacha, Ab Pakka Re Pakka.


212 Sahib Bandgi
When the person getting beyond the yog and others
practices obtains the Naam from the Satguru, only then he
will become the child of the Guru. That will make him
complete, otherwise he will remain unripe. This means that
the Naam given by the Satguru was basic spiritual energy.
Without it an Individual can't cross this worldly ocean of
Life and Death. With the Dharsan of Satguru this power
increases. This energy could be obtained by the meditation
but it can be obtained in abundance by the Dharsan of
Guru. Meditation or concentration is just an option for this
Dharsan. In concentration we visualise the Satguru face
and try to obtain the energy from it. However if the
Satguru is in front then the energy is obtained directly.
Hence, according to the Shashtras, if Guru is in front of
you then you shouldn't close your eyes because at that time
you obtain energy directly, you don't have to concentration
for that. So to make you understand the importance of
Dharsan of Guru, Sahib says-
Bar Bar Na Kari Sake, Pakse Paksh Kare Soye.
Kahai Kabir Ta Das Ka, Janam Sufal Hi Hoye.
He is saying that if you are unable to have Dharsan of
your Guru frequently, then you should do it in fifteen days,
your life would be blessed. But sometimes even that can't
be done. Humen are sometimes tangled up in worldly
worries. So for them, Sahib says-
Pakshe Paksh Na Kari Sake, Mas Maas Karu Jaye.
Yame Der Na Laiye, Kahain Kabir Samujhaye.
He is saying then it should be done once in a month.
Sahib urges that the Dharsan of Guru is very important,
once in a month. You will feel weak and Mind will have
stronger hold and control over you. However if you take
Dharsan of your Guru once in a month then that lack of
energy will vanish. In circumstances where we can't have
Dharsan of our Guru, then in that case we should meditate
on him. It should be a top priority to have Dharsan of your
Satguru but if it is not possible then the option is


Changing the world spiritually 213
concentration. But even than Dharsan is importent. If there
is some financial problem to travel to take Dharsan, then
for them Sahib says-
Mas Mas Na Kari Sae, Chhathe Mas Albat.
Ya Me Dheel Na Kijiye, Kahai Kabir Avigat.
He is saying that those followers who can't even have
Dharsan of his Guru within six months, they must have
Dharsan at least once a year. Even they can challenge
Yama, The lord of Death.
However, if one is unable to have Dharsan even once a
year, then there is no option for people like them.
Baras Baras Na Kari Sake, Tako Lage Dosh.
Kahai Kabir Va Jeev So, Kabhun Na Pave Moksh.

There are many lovers in the world. All talk about love and
its glory. But none knows as to what true love is.
Preet Bahut Sansar Mein, Nana Vidhi Ki Hoye.
Uttam Preeti So Janiye, Satguru Se Jo Hoye.
There are many kinds of love in the world but the true love
is that which one has for the Satguru. All other kinds of love are
polluted as well as mortal but the love for a Satguru is the best
of all.
It is not limited to this world alone. It extends beyond the
limits of the world and is related to the 4th Loka. Thus it is
unending and is the only medium for realising Param Purush
Yeh To Ghar Hai Prem Ka, Khala Ka Ghar Nahin.
Shish Utarey Bhuyi Dharai, Tabb Paithe Ghar Mahin.
Sahibji says that it is not easy to love. In order to love the
Satguru one has to shun one’s ego. He says to Dharam Dass that
he can come to him (Sahibji) if he is prepared to do so.
Guru Sahib To Ek Hain, Dooja Sabb Akar.Aapa Tajj Ke Prabhu
Bhajai, Tabb Pavey Deedar.
In fact, a Satguru and Sahibji are the two faces of the same
coin. There is only the difference of form. If a devotee remains
absorbed in his satguru with true devotion, he can surely realise
Paramatma. This can be possible only if he is ego free


214 Sahib Bandgi

## 11 What is Sahaj Marg -Simple Path?

(Path of surrender and Grace)
To obtain the Paramatma tatva, there are three lines-
threads-

1. Yog Marg
2. Gyan Marg
3. Bhakti Marg
   Some mentioning Yog Marg, someone is going for Gyan
   Marg and the others look up to Bhakti Marg. Three paths
   could be seen. If we abserve it carefully, we will find that
   all the people in the world are following one of these paths.
   These three paths are visible. These three threads need to
   be analyzed. Where would we reach via these paths?

What is Yog Marg?
To enter the inner worlds there are three threads/
methods: Meen-Fish, Papeel-Ant and Vihangam-Bird.
Many people are talking about Yog and attainments. We
notice that in the Yog or Meditation there are five
Mudras.Yog (Subtle) is done with five Mudras. All the
great panths or Schools of Yoga in India are following this
direction.
Can the Param Moksh be obtained by the chachari
mudra? Sahib disagrees with it. We can accumulate some
Siddhi powers by this meditation but we can not reach the
Paramatma tatva. We can't overcome the internal inimical
powers with this Sadhana. Even Rishi Parashar was un able
to win over Kamdev-lord of sex by his long years of
penance. The sadhana of Kapil Muni was disrupted by
anger. So it can be concluded that we can't control those
who have their Soul on mercy of six enemies (Desire,
Anger, Lust, Pride and Hatered) with the help of Yog.
Because the people who did devotions at great length of
time were influenced by this internal enemies.
As long as human are under the control of Mind and
Maya, till then enlightenment is impossible.


Changing the world spiritually 215
He Hansa Tu Amar Lok Ka, Pada Kaal Bas Aai.
Panch Pachis Teen Ka Pinjda, Jamein Tohi Rakha Bharmai.
Your enemy is only your Mind, no one else. Hence,
Mind can't be won over with Yog. Whenever one take to
any known path he should enquire as to what he will find
and what is the appropriate thread/method to attain that.
In the five mudras, some chant the onkaar. Onkaar is the
name of Niranjan (Formless God). However the true Naam
is hidden. Therefore with the help of onkaar you can’t get
the Param-tatva. Further Param-tatva can't be obtain by the
Soham. Sahib says-
Jo Jan Hoihain Jauhari, Shabd Lehu Bilagaye.
Saham Soham Jap Mua, Mithya Janm Ganvaye.
Shukdev Muni was the specialist of Soham shabad of
Agochri Mudra, nevertheless, to cross the next stage, he
had to go in for Unmuni Mudra. He took King Janak as his
Guru. King Janak was the specialist in Unmuni Mudra but
even for him to cross the next stage he had to take
Ashtavakra as his Guru. Then there is RRankaar word
which leads to the tenth door. Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh
were experts in this.
However Kabir Sahib says-
Brahma Vishnu Maheshadi Le, Rrankaar Ko Jana.
Uske Aage Purush Puratan, Uski Khabar Na Jana.
Even after the opening of tenth door, Soul is unable to
come out of the web of Kal.
Sidh Sadh Tridevadi Le, Panch Shabd Me Atke.
Mudra Sadh Rahe Ghat Bheetar, Phir Aundhe Muh Latke.
This cycle brings one in to this world again and again.
Hence, any Mudra which was done by our Munis, Yogis,
Yogeshwar etc were unable to take them to Amarlok or
Mahanirvana.
With the help of these Mudras we can never reach Amar
lok. Sahib and Sants have not given any instances of Peer-
Paigambar or munis succeeding with such Mudras.
They have not given explanation on the character of any


216 Sahib Bandgi
deity. Sahib says that all could only reache up to the three
worlds, no one could travel further.
You can't reach mars with a helicopter; it’s beyond the
capability of a helicopter. Similarly, that country is also out
of the reach for the five Mudras. That’s why Sahib doesn't
give any instances of munis. Therefore he was protested in
large scale. Because the path which we have taken for so
long, we are afraid to let it go. We are afraid that, it is like
committing sin, if we give it up.
.........so the Sants Said that Param-tatva can't be obtained
by Yog. In a debate with Gorakhnath ji,
Sahib says-
Ida Vinshe Pingla Vinshe, Vinshe Sushumra Nadi.
Kahain Kabir Suno Ho Gorakh, Kahan Lagao Tadi.
When breath enters Bhanknal, breath can be controled
Sahib has said, “At the time of death every thing (Ida,
Pingle and Shushumna nadis) will be destroyed. Then
where will you concentrate? Your foundation itself is
weak.” Concentration (Dhyan) as per Sant Matt means it
is not same with Yog of Yog Matt. Sahib says that with
these you can't get rid of the subtle web of Mind. Notice, at
times the Yogis are afflicted with lust as well as anger.
Yog is not a bad thing. These will get you many powers
but that wouldn’t be of any other use because all these are
the playthings of Maya. They are the things which are used
by mind to stop the being from going towards the Atma
gyan. Those Siddhi make the beings get lost in them and
doesn't let them free. Thgey do not try to go farther up.
Sahib says-
Koi Koi Pahuncha Brahm Lok Mein, Dhar Maya Le Aai.
Attracted to these miraculous powers the being gets
sidetracked from his main goal. You hear that with these
powers the Munis have only conducted violently and
brutally. By these powers you are only hurting others. But
a real Mahatma doesn't hurt anyone. We are not decrying
them because they were not at fault here; they were within


Changing the world spiritually 217
the limits of Niranjan.when Kapil muni incinerated 60000
sons of King Sagar then what it was. Means they were not
able to win over the internal enemies. Durvasa ji cursed
56 0 millions Yadavs, what was that. If they are not able to
control anger after years of worshipping then how you can
obtain Atam gyan with this. There the mind needs to be
destroyed completely, the lust and anger are simply the
hands of Mind.
Take for instance Parashar, what he did with machhodari
was not morally correct for an Atam gyani. Then what was
the achivement of all that long years of worshipping. The
Girl tried to save herself. She said that the Sun is watching,
and then Parashar covered the Sun with Clouds. When the
Girl argued that the Water is watching, with the power of
his penance he covered the water with sand. The Girl still
wanted to defend herself. She argued that she is the
daughter of a fisherman and her flesh reeks of fish. At that
Parashar with his powers fragranced her body whose scent
spread to a large area 12Km radius. He was able to do all
of this with those powers. However in the end when lust
came over him, he wasn't able to resist it and ended in
engaging sexual intercourse with the young Girl. The Girl
wanted to save herself but the man proved to be too much
powerful. Will you call him Atam gyani?
An atam gyani is the one who sees Soul in everyone. He
doesn't get attracted towards the body. Is this an insult no,
this is to make clear to you that what you would get from
such worship. Also, with the worshipping of deities one
can't reach Amar lok. Kabir Sahib says that we are not
decrying anyone; we are just mentioning that is what you
will obtain from such devotion and where would you reach
through it. But the world protests.
....so this means that we can't get out of the girp of Mind
and Maya with the help of Yog. Mind is very powerful and
there are proofs that even after the Yog Sadhna humen are
unable to control the Mind.


218 Sahib Bandgi
What is Gyan Marg?
Gyan marg implies to grasping Param-tatva with the
help of knowledge. Are we the opposed to knowledge? No.
Ravan was a genius, but under the influence of lust he
abducted the other's wife. He had the knowledge of four
Vedas. He was efficient in Adminstration. When he was
dying, Ram ji sent Lakshman to learn the Art of
adminstration from him. Means he was such a genius but
he remained within the limits of Mind and Maya. He was
unable to get out of the network of lust.
What is Bhakti-Yog?
Bhakti implies banishment of the internal deformities. A
true Bhakta is one who doesn't involve in sensual
pleasures. You should stay away from this. But the people
are moved far away from real Bhakti in this Kalyug. But
the Sants say that don't worry, Satguru will help you cross
this worldly ocean of life, attain Param Moksh. There is no
glory for Guru in Yog. So you will say that the devotion is
diminished. No.
Bhakti Swatantra Sakal Gun Khani,
Binu Satsang Na Pave Prani.
But being in devotion is not an easy task.
So there are these three paths. The path of Sants is
different from these. Let’s understand the concept of Path
of Sant (Sant- matt).
The Simple Path of Sants
The Sant Matt follows Sahaj-marg, the elegant and
simple path of Bringa. This is the path sharanagati,
Complete Surrender. Sahib says you don't have to do
anything, Satguru will grant you Param Moksh with
Krupa-Grace. (Moksh moolam Guru Krupa)
In Yog-Marg, there is importance of Yoga-Action, not
the Guru. In Gyan-Marg, the importance is for knowledge
not Guru; and in Bhakti-Marg the importance is for
devotion not Guru. But in the Sahaj Marg of Sant Matt
there is only the importance of Satguru. The student only


Changing the world spiritually 219
needs to stay in the shadow of his Satguru. All the other
work would be done by Satguru. Sahib says-
Teen Lok Nav Khand Mein, Guru Se Bada Na Hoye.
Karta Kare Na Kar Sake, Guru Kare So Hoye.
Guru does everything. The sayings of Kabir Sahib are
establishing the importance of a Satguru.
Kabir Hari Ke Ruthte, Guru Ki Sharani Jaye.
Kahain Kabir Guru Ruthte, Prabhu Nahin Hot Sahaye.
Kabir Te Nar Andh Hain, Guru Ko Kehte Aur.
Hari Ruthe Guru Thaur Hai, Guru Ruthe Nahin Thaur.
Can you find it somewhere else? No, this much
importence of a Guru can't be found anywhere else. If we
go to Yog-kal we will witness that there have been feuds
between a Guru and his student but the Sant Matt says-
Guru Gunge Guru Banvare, Guru Ke Rahiye Das.
Jo Guru Bheje Narak Mein, To Swarg Ki Rakhiye Aas.
.....so there comes the concept of sharanagati. This is a very
big change. Those who take shelter are protected by the
one who shelter them...this is a sure thing. See, Vibhishan
had gone to Ram ji. When in the battle Ravan attacked
him, the attack was taken upon by Ram ji. If you are in the
shelter provided by the Satguru then the powers of Satguru
will protect you. Then you need not to make extra efforts
for your progress.
Jo Satguru Ki Sharan Ho Taki,
Tehi Kuchh Yatan Rahai Nahin Baki.
Tate Sharanagat Sab Parhai,
Sharan Gahai Te Jivan Ubarhai.
If after in the being with the Guru you still need to look
after your well being then that means there has been no
Sharanagati-surrender. In reality, Sharanagati is a great
power in itself. In this, knowledge and power come by
itself and all the sins are flushed away. Sharanagati is a
great goodness.
Sharanagat Keh Sab Gun Aave,
Gyan Bhakti Tehi Mahin Samave.
Sharan Ho Jab Yeh Nischey Aai,


220 Sahib Bandgi
Prabhu Mohi Dono Sakal Sahai.
Sakal Paap Tako Jari Jaave,
Jo Satguru Ki Sharan Mein Aave.
Those who are in the shelter of Guru, all his works are
completed by Guru. The similar words were being said by
a Mahatma in a Satsang. There was a man sitting there. He
asked him if we don't eat then will the Lord feed us. The
mahatma replied in affirmative. That man left eating food
from that day; he wanted to see how Lord would feed him.
He didn't eat for full day. His wife asked him to take food.
Lord tried to feed him through his wife with affection. But
man didn't eat it. The hunger increased the next day; the
house was also flooding with smell of food, so the man
went to forest and sat there. There was a marriage
ceremony taking place there nearby. When the time came
for feast, people brought some food to the man under the
tree thinking he would be hungry but he still refused. The
people left the food there and left. The smell of food
overwhelmed him so he sat under another tree. When night
fell two thieves came there, seeing food they began to
partake that food but Lord entered one thief and told the
other that there could be poison in this. The second One
replied yes and they began to search for the person. They
saw that man sitting under the tree. They caught him and
said you are very clever. You want to poison and take
away our possessions. The man replied that I don't know
anything. I haven't poisoned anything. One of them asked
man to eat the sweet. The man replied “I won't eat it”. The
other thief said there is something. They beat the man up
and put the sweet in his mouth forcefully. Then the same
way all the other things were fed forcefully. If he refused
then he was beaten up.
On the next day, the man fell at the feet of Mahatma and
said it is true; Lord can make us eat even when we don't
want to.


Changing the world spiritually 221
This is the truth, firstly he will try with affection and
care and after that he will try force. But this can only
happen if we have faith. If we are full of treachery and
cheating then it won’t happen. So the Sharanagati is
important.....with pure heart. Let me tell you about
Sharanagati.
Sharanagat Ho Patgun Mahiye,
Aise Tako Vyora Kahiye.
Vishi Nishedh Nijguru Ki Teva,
Dutiye Satguru Preet Aru Seva.
Tritiye Yeh Nishchey Ur Dhare,
Mo Adh Bisari Nath Mohi Tare.
Chathe Yeh Nischey Man Mahi,
Prabhu Taji Mor Sahayak Nahin.
Kaise Hu Dukh Sankare Gdha,
Prabhu Taji Aur Sahaye Na Dhundha.
Pancham Satguru Murti Ko Dhyana,
Take Sanmukh Vinti Thana.
Prabhu Taji Mor Thikana Nahin,
Pavan Patit Naam Prabhu Aahin.
Mo Sam Patit Na Katahu Nihara,
Prabhu Sam Aur Na Taranhara.
Chhatye Apko Prabhuhin Samarpe,
Toko Kabhun Kal Nahin Darpe.
Yeh Shatgn Jo Koi Dhara,
Sharanagat Pall Mein Kar Para.
He is saying that there are six characteristics of
Sharanagati. Those who will possess these six will be able
to cross over in a moment.
Following the rules set by the Guru
Means the rules set by the Guru should not be broken.
Like you were told about the seven rules at the time of
Naam Dhan, those rules should not be broken. If you are
told to not eat meat, then you shouldn't. If gambling is not
allowed then you should not do it. If you will disrupt any
rule, then the effect will be on your memory. What is need
for stealing, cheating or treachery? If you can get food for


222 Sahib Bandgi
only one time then be happy with that but never steal. This
is the real devotion. This is the base of Sharanagati, the
first step.

Loving Service to Satguru
Means serve your Satguru with body, mind and
possessions. When you took Naam Dan then I told you to
offer your body, mind and wealth.
But not just like that; by closing your eyes and with pure
heart. You gave it to me. The people whom Gorakhnath
gave Naam, he didn't gave their body back, they would
have to roam and remain with him. But we are not doing
that. We returned your body to you, I told you to protect it
by thinking of it as yours. You shouldn't do any wrong
deed with this body. It was returned to you because there
are elders in your house and also for the fact that you have
to serve your parents. But whenever I need you, I will call
you. A Disciple should serve in the Ashram in time
according to their caliber. If you serve physically then no
physical harm ill ever befall you. Then your mind was also
returned to you. I said that you will need it for care of your
family, hence it was returned to you. But you were not
allowed to use it for wrong purposes. A Disciple needs to
give one tenth part of his earning (As per scriptures) but I
didn't ask you, because in case if you unable to, then the
words of Guru broken. Then the third thing is Mind. This
was not returned to you, I kept it with me.
Why was Mind not returned to you? Because this Mind
is associated with all worldly attachments, that's why the
Soul is saying that this is mine. When the Mind is given to
the Guru then why are you considering it as yours? So
don't ever expect respect from your Guru and also break
his words.
Guru Ki Baat Man Sab Lije, Satya Asatya Vichar Na Kije.
Don’t use your logic to judge whether what the Guru is
saying is true or not. Whatever he says just have faith in


Changing the world spiritually 223
him; don't use your own logic for his words. Never disobey
any order from your Guru. You shouldn't disobey him by
thinking about your own benefits. The only success is the
service of Guru.
If this body gets the chance of serving Guru, then do it.
Because-
Akhir Yeh Tan Khak Milega....
All the other deeds will not add into your account. If you
are busy in doing your own work like farming business
etc., those will not help you. Only Guru's service is of
utmost importance. If a Disciple doesn't serve his Guru
then it’s a crime. Therefore it is a necessary.
Nanak Jo Guru Seve Apna, Haun Tis Balihari Jaun.
The service of Guru is a great thing. Sahib says-
Guru Seve Kate Dukh Papa,
Janam Janam Ko Mite Santapa.
Guru Ki Seva Sada Chit Dije,
Jivan Janam Sufal Kari Lije.
Chaubis Roop Hari Apuhi Dhariya,
Guru Seva Kari Sabhi Biriya.
Shiv Biranchi Guru Seva Kinha,
Narad Diksha Druv Ko Dinha.
Sakal Muni Guru Seva Chahi,
Guru Seva Kari Panth Avgahi.
Guru Ki Seva Mukti Nij Pave,
Bahuri Na Hansa Bhavjal Aave.
Service of Guru brings glory. Even great Munis have
served the Gurus. Even Hari incarnated he put his Mind
into service of Guru. Those who have attained the human
body and don’t have a Guru are unlucky but those who
have a Guru but still don’t serve him is an idiot.
Yog Dan Jap Tirth Nahana,
Guru Seva Binu Nishfal Jana.
Guru Seva Binu Bahu Pachhtave,
Phiri Phiri Yam Ke Dware Jave.
Guru Seva Binu Kaun Jo Tare,
Bhav Sagar Se Bahar Dare.
Guru Seva Binu Kachhu Na Sari Hai,


224 Sahib Bandgi
Mahaandh Kupai Mahan Pari Hai.
Guru Seva Binu Ghat Andhiyara,
Kaise Prakate Gyan Ujiyara.
Guru Seva Bnu Dwandva Andhera,
Guru Seva Binu Kaal Ko Chera.
Guru Seva Binu Prem Bihuna,
Din Din Moh Hoye Bhram Duna.
Sahib says without Guru's service, Yog, Jap, Tap and all
the Pilgrimages are waste. If you won't serve your Guru
you will have to face the consequences later. Without his
service there can't be light of knowledge. Those who don't
possess the attitude of service to his Guru, they neglected
Love of Guru.
The Disciple should never bear arrogance in his heart
while in the service of Guru. If arrogance is within you
then the service of Guru will not be of any value to you.
You need to live leaning from your Guru to receive his
grace.
Guru Aage Rakhe Math,
Karai Vinay Dukh Meto Nath.
Ahaun Adhin Tumhare Dasa,
Dehu Apne Charanan Vasa.

Hohu Dyal Daya Ab Kije,
Dubat Bhav Mein Banh Gahije.
By watching that devotion in his disciple, the Guru
becomes happy. When the Guru becomes happy, then the
student can ask anything. The glory of service to ones
Satguru is much more than anything. Sahib says-
Namvant Bahute Mile, Gyanvant Anek.
Kahain Kabir Dharamdas Se, Guruvanta Koi Ek.
Service to the Guru will provide you wonderful results;
you will obtain all the pleasantries. Sahib says-
Ganga Yamuna Badrish Samete,
Jaganathadi Dham Hain Tete.
Seve Phal Prapat Hoye Na Teto,
Guru Seva Mein Pave Phal Teto.
He is saying that you will get that fruit from Service to
the Guru which you can't get from visiting Ganga,
Yamuna, Badrinath or Jaganath.
Faith in Satguru under all Conditions
Yeh Nischey Ur Dhare, Mo Agh Bisari Nath Mohi Tare.
Means you need to have faith that even if I do something
or not, my Guru will give Param moksh. This faith is a
great thing. Body is not given to everyone. But you gave.
There was a faith. At the time of Naam Dhan I didn't ask
for anything from you, only asked for your faith. What is
faith? Faith is that my Guru never lies. Faith that-
Guru Ko Akhand Brahm Kar Jane,
Guru Ko Nahin Manush Kar Mane.
Trust your Satguru, no other
Yeh Nischey Man Mahin, Guru Taji Mor Sahayak Nahin.
Never look for a support other than from your Satguru.
Have belief that no one but my Guru is with me. When you


226 Sahib Bandgi
have found a true Satguru then you don't need to bow to
others. Don’t do this. If you have Satguru then the power
of Satguru is at a highest level, you will be able to get
anything. Even if you are unable to get it, stay in his
shadow. No matter what the problem, think-
Duniya Ke Lakhan Sahare, Mera Sahara Tu Hai.
Don’t go to an astrologer or a sayana at the time of
crisis. This shouldn't happen.
Guru Sharanagati Chhadi Kari,
Karai Bharosa Aur.
Sukh Sampati Ki Keh Chali,
Nahin Narak Mein Thaur.
So The Sharanagati Should Be Fierce.
Ek Aas Vishvas Tumhari,
Pada Dwar Sab Vidhi Main Hari.
Understand the concept of faith. An unripe being would
be worried. I just remembered an instance. A lady arrived
and said-
Lady- I have headache.
Me- do bhajan.
Lady- I do bhajan, I do Aarti, and I also pay respects to the
goddess.
What was this? Means she had not understood the
meaning of devotion. A couple brought their mentally
disturbed son to me and said that after Naam Dhan he
remains alright for few days and then there was disruption.
I asked the boy then he replied I am alright. They take me
to Sayanas (Tantrik) and don't listen to me. I have complete
faith in you but they don't listen to me.
This, you shouldn't do this. This is not faith.
Concentrate on Satguru, and be humble in his presence
Satguru Murti Ko Dhyana, Take Sanmukh Vinti Thana.
Means keep concentration on Guru. Your thinking
should be-
Mo Sam Patit Na Kathun Nihara,
Prabhu Sam Aur Na Taranhara.


Changing the world spiritually 227
Never exaggerate yourselves in front of your Guru,
always tell him about your shortcomings so that he can get
them out of you.
Main Kami Main Kutlu, Main Avgn Ki Khan.
Mo Par Kripa Na Chhadiye, Das Aapno Jaan.
Avgun Kiye To Bahu Kiye, Karat Na Man Haar.
Bhave Banda Baksh Do, Bhave Gardan Maar.
Satguru Deen Dayal Ji, Tum Lag Meri Daud.
Jaise Kag Jahaj Par, Sujhat Kathu Na Thaur.
If you will exaggerate yourself, there will be nothing
left. Sahib says-
Satguru Ki Maryad Na Dharai,
Lakh Churasi Kund Mein Parai.
Guru Ko Shabd Na Sune Agyani,
Bhavsagar Dube Abhimani.
Sahib warns you to stay in the orbs of Guru. Those who
would defy it will have to face the Chaurasi.
Guru Ko Dekhi Dharat Abhimana,
Vyas Bachan Pad Naraknodhana.
Those who show anger in front of his Guru will burn in
hell.
Guru Ko Gyan Meti Mat Thapi,
Teen Lok Mein Bado Te Papi.
Guru Ko Meti Bakhanat Aapa,
Dharti Bhar Marat Tehi Papa.
Guru Se Uncha Chadhi Baithe,

Those who show their knowledge in order to undermine
the Guru's knowledge are most sinful person. The weight
of such person is not even supported by this earth. He is
trying to sit higher than the Guru. This type of person will
rot in seven hells.
Guru Se Ulta Bachan Sunave, Sat Janam Kodhi Ko Pave.
Guru Ko Ulat Sunave Baina, Sat Janam Andha Hoye So Naina.
Those who debate with Guru or backtalk suffer with
physical deformations or become blind in seven lives.

Tum Bandichhor Atihi Anatha,
Bhavjal Budat Pakdo Hatha.
Yo Adhin Hoye Shish Jabhin,
Shish Par Kripa Karai Guru Tabhin.
Sahib says that when the Disciple depends completely
on Guru, only then he can have the blessings of his Guru.
Leave all your burden of Sahib in submission.
Chhathye Apko Prabhuhin Samarpe,
Tako Kabhun Kal Nahi Darpe.
It means surrender yourself, Leave all the burden of this
world on Sahib and see. Keep such feelings in your Heart-
Jivan ka sab saup diya ab, bhaar tumharey hatho mey|
Hai jeet tumharey hatho mey, hai haar tumharey hatho mey||
Submission is greater than Dhyan and Bhajan, if faith is
present then it gives greater benefits. I will narrate you an
instance. There was a very innocent Man. After Naam
Dhan he came to me and said Guru Ji from the time I have
lived a very pleasurable life. He said Guru Ji at the time of
Naam Dhan, you asked for our Body, Mind and Possesions
by closing your eyes with sankalp fron the Heart. I thought
that it is a real exchange then I gave it to you. I thought of
my wife, my children and my house as yours because I
have given it to you. I have a small shop. Whenever I open
it, I do it by thinking it as yours shop. You stand their 24
hours and do all the work. Whenever there is loss to
happen, you stand forward to spare us from it. Nothing is
mine. Everything is as you wish to. I am thinking
everything that belongs to me is yours; I am just a servant
who has been given the task of serving the family instead
staying and serving in the Ashram. All my attachments
have vanished. He said a lot of things. He was very
innocent, he was saying Guru Ji, you come at night and
takes me to places; see there was no ounce of cleverness in


Changing the world spiritually 229
him. See he had devoted himself completely, that's why
Sahib had to complete his all work.
Can we be partner in the abstinence of a tatva? What do
we have to do? Sahib said something. It has merit. The
instance of Brunga was given. He converts any other insect
by his sound in another Brunga. But there is one
proposition here.
Bhringi Shabd Keet Jo Mana, Varan Pher Aapan Kar Jana.
Koi Koi Keet Param Sukhdai, Pratham Avaz Gahe Chitlai.
Koi Duje Koi Tije Mane, Tan Man Rahit Shabd Hit Jane.
Bhringi Shabd Keet Na Gahai, Tau Puni Keet Asre Rahai.
Some get converted into Brunga in the first attempt.
Some take two to three attempts. They hear the sound but
they fear make them anxious. Like when women bring
their children for blessing they cry because they think that
he is a doctor and will give us an injection shot. Because he
had visited the doctor formerly. Similarly, the insect thinks
that the Brunga will devour me.
Gurushabd Nischey Satya Mane, Bhringi Mat Tab Pavai.
Taji Sakal Aasa Shabd Basa, Kaga Hans Kahavai.
The word of Guru is pleasurable. In the process of
development of Brunga there is a pulsating sound boo!
boo!. Some are not transformed in the first try. Why?
Because they are not devoted. Those who are not listening
devotedly can't get transformed. If it didn't happen by third
try then the Brunga leaves the larve and goes in search of
another.
To Puni Keet Asre Rahai.
Unable to become Brunga.......he remains in his former
form. Swami Paramanand ji explains-
Bhringi Jo Aan Keet Ko Khud Rang Lagave,
Avajj Apni Aansikh Kan Sikhave.
Veh Roop Pehla Raha Ek Na Baki,
Guru Shabd Se Filfaur Rang Palat So Jave.
Koi Aur Kism Karm Ko Jindar Na Dekhe,
Bhringi Jo Apme Dhang Keet Dhundh Ke Lave.

230 Sahib Bandgi
Dil De Ke Usko Tabhi Aone Roop Banave.
Dil Usko Dena Chahiye Dildar Koi Ho,

Hain Keet Lakh Sadme Koi Ek Hi Mera,
Jahan Jake Bar Bar Bhring Karta Hwi Fera.
Vahi Keet Jehal Apne Se Gurubat Na Mane,
Tab Jake Pas Uske Bhring Karta Hai Dera.
Kehta Hai Keet Tumko Lagi Aan Kharabi,
Nahin Akl Thikane Rahi Nahin Ilm Hai Tera.
Tu Baat Meri Man Abki Bar Kan Dhar,

Dil Usko Dena Chahiye Dildar Koi Ho,
Hindu Ya Musalman Kharidar Koi Ho.
Out of 27 lakh of larvae of insects, one may come in the
sight of Bringa it makes several rounds in search. Then
after giving him his heart he makes it similar to himself.
Therefore, it is said that the heart should be given to one,
who is worthy of it. He will experience the Truth.
Devotion should be like this. This is surrender. Thoughts
come to mind that what is the need of this? In actually
these are bound. Soul believes that money is important so it
carries out many deeds to attain it. Why there is a need for
body, mind and wealth? Why is it being taken away from
us? Soul believed that body is mine. Therefore when Soul
enters the body it begins to work for it. We can observe
this whenever body faces a problem.
Jabte Jeev Bhayo Sansari,
Chhute Na Granthi Na Hoye Sukhari.
Then it happens to think of wealth as its own. Now it
makes efforts to attain it. Whether they are right or wrong
it doesn't matter. So this whole universe is with the Mind.
(Mano Moolam Idam jagatu- Mind pervades the entire
Universe) This Mind binds.
These three (Taan, maan and Dhan) are taken. What is
the meaning of this? When you gave body, it ends the
confusion that I am body. When wealth is given away then
cupidity vanishes. What is giving up mentality? It means


Changing the world spiritually 231
don't use arrogance or memory overtake. Why? Whatever
you will do with this mind, it would be treachery.
Whatever deeds were being done by memory, intelligence
or arrogance is all destructive. These four confuses
everyone. Therefore, you must surrender yourself to Guru.
Whatever he says, accept it.
....so those who will attain these six features will attain
Moksha in a moment. He need not to do anything else.
When a child is small then the mother takes care of child at
every whim. She feeds him, make him drink, make him
sleep and does all kinds of works. But as the child grows,
then the mother doesn't take care of him that much. Sure,
she put the food in front of him but doesn't feed him with
her own hands. Just like that for the time the being stays in
the shadow of Guru, till then the Guru take care of him.
Guru doesn't get worried over an intelligent follower.
Hence, always remain humble in front of Satguru, remain
in Sharanagati so that we are in orbs of Satguru and attain
our goals easily.
Kabir Sahib says-
Na Kuch Kiya Na Kari Sakha, Na Karney Yog Sharir|
Jo Kuch Kiya Sahib Kiya, Bhaya Kabir Kabir||
The one who directs you towards meritorious actions
for Spiritual advancement; he would have persued the
same path. This means that he has never seen the Amarlok
and Param Purush. His Guru also would not have been a
Sant Satguru. Otherwise he will not be directing to Sadhna
and Kamaai and his mission is not of a Sant Matt. Satguru
like a security guard will stand by you always. You cannot
overcome Maya Shakti (power of Illusion) on your own
effort. The Satya Naam of Satguru will accomplish this for
you. This is Sahaj marg.

You need not do any Sadhna. This is Brunga matha.

## 12 Keep Safe from Hypocrites.

In the three worlds all are worshipping Kal Purush.
Gan Gandharv Rishi Muni Aru Deva,
Sab Mil Lag Niranjan Seva.
Why are people worshipping him? There must be a
reason for that.
If we take a look around we could see that everyone is
worshipping the wrong things. Some are worshipping trees,
others rivers, even stones are being worshipped. Now why
is that? This is not the fault of humans. They have been
directed on the wrong path of devotion. This has been done
by some selfish people to get benefit from these practices.
If someone establishes a statue on a mountain and says
that this mountain has the statue from other eon then whole
of the world will huddle there to pay their respects. They
say that if you bow to the statue then all your wishes will
be fulfilled. Same is the case with the making holy
river/ponds and spreading rumors like those who take bath
in the holy water will get rid of all the physical problems.
All these are dramas set on worldly stage. Nowadays
humans are afflicted with a number of diseases so
naturally, a great number of people reach there. Then that
water becomes so dirty that even a healthy person could
become ill from bathing in there. But the world doesn't
listen. They bath there, offer money in that place and
comes home. No one pay any thought on it. No one tries
to understand this drama. This is the wrong devotion.
Phony people earn by these methods. They have confused
the whole society with these methods.
Khare Syane Sabhi Bhatke, Teen Lok Mein Sabhi Atke.
Their promotion is at a very large scale. People are
innocent, they are easy pray to play, they manipulate and
confuse.
Then some village people even collect money on the
name of 'Chanda' subscriptions, during festivals seasons.
They are collected by force, even the ones who don't want


Changing the world spiritually 233
to give must also to give. Every household is asked to give
50 - 100 rupees. Poor people forced to give by taking loans.
The reason given is that it is for feast and the ritual
ceremony to pay heed to Deities. Wow...what devotion.
Then what are the slogans. This money is to set, Animal
scarifies in the name of the Deity. They are needed to pay
tribute to the Deities and that would grant their desires.
Sahib makes you understand that these people are only
confusing and entangling you. Sahib says-
Ye Keval Bhram Ke Utpati.
The opposition to me from the phonies is greater than
anyone out there. Treachery and cheating is increasing day
by day. Someone is becoming priest, astrologer etc. to
hoard wealth. I am not having feud with any caste or
deities. My aim is just to point to you that to be warned
from phonies and to learn that Lord reside within you not
outside.
Even educated people are caught in this confusing web.
For small problems people are going to these phonies.
They call, come to me. I will make everything better. Then
they makes the whole family dance on their toes.
Once drum was beating in Ranjhadi and a lady began to
dance to the music. I understood that she has been dancing
enough for the phonies before. Now it has become a habit.
In the web of phonies, there are not only the uneducated
people but educated one too. In an engineer's house, there
formed ant hill on the wall. He called me. Then he took me
to that room which had ant hill. There was a cloth there. I
thought that there were some luxurious tings and I told him
to pick the cloth off. Just as he picked the cloth I
remembered army. When we went to fight in army, then
there we create raised the land somewhat as to create small
hills. The same scenario was here. I asked what it is. He
replied it is due to my grandfather’s death. I replied that
this is Ant hill. But he replied that no it is not, it is due to


234 Sahib Bandgi
grandfather's death, it comes back again even after its
removal.
Ant hill is harmful. When it is removed first and when it
comes back again then it is much stronger than the last one.
But a phony used to beat drum for the spirits there and
collect money. They were drowned too deep in
superstitions by influence of those phonies. So I thought
that if I told him simply to remove it then he would not be
able to understand. Therefore I told him to remove it on
Thursday from 5 to 6 by taking Sahib's name...
....just like that phonies have destroyed the different
communities. The people from other communities are
doing this, they are superstitious. They are even asking me
to do these things like giving money and things like that.
They promise not to oppose me, if I encourage these
things.
Phonies can go to any lengths to distract you from the
path of true devotion (Satya Bhakti), be cautious of them.
They will measure you on a balance. They will even
oppose you. You just need to be fierce.
You will be put on test
This world is very cruel. I had to go through many
hardships to bring the being in to True devotion of the
Param Purush because this world belongs to Kal Purush
and the being doesn't understand easily. Then the people
who come into this path are disrupted by the world. If our
Naami has suffered loss somewhere then they taunt that
you always speak highly of Sahib Bandgi but now you are
in loss.
See, in this world of happiness and sadness the norms
are so difficult. No attention is paid to Aatmdev-Soul, the
path of devotion and also to the inner peace. If attention is
paid then it is to the sorrows of this destructible world. It is
due to the norm observed, that's why the great people had
to face sorrows. Guru Nanak dev ji had to go to prison,
Guru Arjun dev ji had to sit on the burning metal and


Changing the world spiritually 235
Paltoo Sahib Ji was burnt alive. There was so much pain.
Mirabai also was treated with so much pain. If the
Mahapurush who gave the lessons of true devotion to the
society had to go through so much pain then the people
who are worshipping Param Purush will also face sorrows.
If you will try to leave the world of Kal Purush then
obviously the Kal Purush will try his best to stop you from
leaving his worlds.
This is only one side of the coin. Now the second side is
like this. The security you get from the worshipping of true
devotion (satya Bhakti) can't be imagined even from the
devotion of Kal Purush. The sustenance provided by the
Kal Purush is insignificant to the sustenance provided by
the true Naam. The people devoted to the Kal Purush face
many sorrows then after that they have to come again on
this earth, but even here also they have face sorrows.
Firstly, he will not have the inner peace but they are not
protected even in times of crisis. This work can only be
done by the Satguru as there is no Satguru in the devotion
of the Kal Purush, there is only a guide who shows you the
path to devotion with the help certain books and scriptures.
Therefore in second aspect we see that lots of big events
are happening in this world. Many people are dying but no
one is saying anything regarding it. I just want o enquire
that if this world belongs to God-Paramatma then why is
that Paramatma not protecting them. Means he approves
this. During religious pilgrimage many types of accidents
are encountered which often results in the death of people.
Those people who used to laugh at us that Sahib Bandgi
didn't save you, comment that you have been punished by
God. Even if someone's leg is broken, someone's arm is
broken, some lose their eyes and some even go into coma,
even then they say that they have been saved by God.
Some of them may die they won't even talk about them but
if asked they will reply that they are now free. They have
been set free by god. Wow. This is world.


236 Sahib Bandgi
On 12th October 2007, I read in a newspaper that few
people who were going to a Deity’s place met with an
accident. 40 people died in that accident. Some were
injured, they were taken to hospital. Now give it a thought.
We have no feud with anyone. We sympathize with them
that so many people died. However, I want to just ask them
at times you tell us that even Sahib Bandgi didn't protect,
now your own are hurt and you have suffered a great loss.
So give it some thought.
On the route to Badrinath, whenever an accident
happens there are usually no survivors. These types of
accidents have happened many times, many have died and
many have been injured but no one would ever say that we
were visiting a pilgrimage place and we were not protected
by anyone. But even if a single child falls ill from Sahib
Bandgi then they say that it’s because they have left the
deities (Worshiping Forms). The lots of people who have
died are not commented upon. When nothing will come in
their thoughts then they will say that God has set them free.
Arjun didn't wanted to battle because to kill peers is
considered a Sin but in the end he had to. After that
Pandavas had to do penance. Initially they started with the
yagya. However even when that didn’t work they have to
seek redemption in the Himalaya. This was setting free,
People are calling this Mukti. Sahib says-
Bahu Gunjan Jeevan Kahan Deenha,
Tako Kahe Mukti Hari Deenha.
Furthermore-
Bali Se To Chhal Keenah Bahuta,
Punya Nasaye Keenah Ajgoota.
Chhal Budhhi Deenhe Tahin Patala,
Koi Na Lakhai Prapanchi Kala.
Laghu Saroop Hoye Pratham Dekhye,
Prithivi Leenah Swasti Karaye.
Swasti Karai Tabai Pragtana,
Deergh Roop Dekhi Bali Na Bhaye Mana.
Teeni Pag Teenau Pur Bhayau,


Changing the world spiritually 237
Adha Panv Nrip Dan Na Diyau.
Dehu Puraye Nrip Patalahin Deenha,
Andha Jeev Chhal Pragat Na Cheenha.
Tab Lai Peeth Napaye Tehi Teenha,
Hari Le Tahi Patalai Keenha.
Yahi Char Jeev Dekhi Nahin Cheenha,
Kahai Mukti Hari Humako Deenha.
King Bali couldn't provide half foot space therefore he
was sent to underground. Humans can't see what is in front
of their face and they say that they have been set free by
Hari.
.....so our Naamis are being judged on norms. The truth is
that Kal Purush can't harm you. If you face any sorrow
then think of it as something from Param Purush. The truth
is that Kal Purush can't give you sorrows. He is not able to
do it because you have Satguru's power along with you, he
will protect you. If you feel pain then considers it as a
punishment for the wrong deed. Neverthless even this
punishment would be a tolerable one. If you get distracted
from the path of devotion to Satguru, and began ignoring
the Guru's words and walk opposite to the principles of
your Guru then the Kal Purush will drag you away, you
will lose the protection of that power.
Guru Seedi Se Utre, Shabd Bihuna Hoye.
Tako Kaal Ghaseethi, Rakh Sakai Na Koye.
Then no one can save you. However if you remain
steady on your path of devotion to the Guru then there
would be no control of Kal Purush over you.
On the other hand, the punishments given by the Kal
Purush are very much painful as compared to this, those
are intolerable and even then there is no justice, you are
often punished even if you are not at fault, because there
you also get the punishments for the Karma of previous
births but with Satguru your deeds of the previous births
are terminated. If there is no result of previous deeds then
how could you be punished? Therefore the peace which
can be obtained at the feet of Satguru can't be found


238 Sahib Bandgi
anywhere else. But Kal Purush will punish even without
any mistake (So called in the common good of all). Sahib
says-
Niranjan Dhan Tumro Darbar, Jahan Tanik Na Nyaye Vichar.
Rangmahal Mein Base Maskhare, Pas Tere Sardar.
Dhoor-Dhoop Mein Sadhu Virajain, Bhaye Jo Bhavnidhi Paar.
Veshya Odhe Khasa Malmal, Gal Motiyan Ko Haar.
Pativrata Ko Mile Na Khadi, Sookha Niras Ahar.
Pakhandi Ko Jag Mein Adar, Sant Ko Kahain Labar.
Agyani Ko Param Viveki, Gyani Ko Moodh Ganvar.
Kehhin Kabir Fakir Pukari, Ulta Sab Vyavhar.
Sanch Kahe Jag Maran Dhaye, Joothan Ko Aitbaar.
Sahib says Niranjan; there is no justice at your doorstep.
The Sants who where liberated while living –Jeevan
muktas, this world had burnt them in the burning sun. But
the prostitutes had the best clothes to wear in the whole
world and they had pearl necklace around their necks. The
ones who are devoted to their husband had to wear khadi,
also their food was lower than ordinary. The phonies had
respect in your reign but the true Sants are labeled fake in
your world. The ignorant people who talk by learning from
books are labeled geniuses in your world. On the other
hand, those who speak from experience are insulted and
called stupid and illiterate. The mechanism of the world of
Niranjan is opposite. Those who talk about the true
Paramatma-Lord get beaten by this world but the ones who
talk about fake Paramatma or Niranjan are believed easily.
.....so, you will be judged on the norms-Practices. Do not
worry. You just need to fierce.

You will face opposition
The people of the world cannot see the brilliance of the
devotion. Devotion has vanished, the thing that has
remains is the pretense. Look around you, people are
committing Sins but they are also calling themselves the
devotees. They are saying they are the worshippers, we are
saying that this is not devotion. People are consuming meat


Changing the world spiritually 239
and alcohol, they are into cheating and treachery but they
are still calling themselves devotee. We are denying this. If
you give it a thought you will see that the people who are
protesting against you are not at all good, they will not be
good character and also their eating habits would be
deteriorated. This is my assurance. They will also be into
cheating and treachery. However your living style is the
best. You are not consuming alcohol and meat, you are not
stealing and also you are not committing any evil deeds.
Then why are you being protested?
In this era, People are confusing others in a concerted
manner. How is Kaliyug, I will tell you, there was a
person from Birpur who accepted Christianity. No one
protested, his whole family and villagers accepted him
with open arms. Even his whole family accepted the
Christianity. He used to go to church and also consume
meat. Then he came in contact with one of my Naamis.
He came, listened to Satsang and after some time he even
took Naam Dhan. He left the consumption of alcohol and
meat. Then this time the villagers protested. The relatives
didn't even visit him anymore. Everyone left him.
Now give it a thought. When he accepted Christianity he
was not at all protested but when he took Naam from Sahib
Bandgi he was protested in a large scale and the contacts
with him were severed. He was decried. Now why was he
decried? Didn’t the villagers saw that he was not
consuming alcohol and meat, he was not stealing anymore,
he was not lying, nor was he committing any evil deeds,
wasn't it good? Everyone saw that. But why did they turn
their back to him? This is a very weird thing to do. When
he was Christian everyone was with him. The Christian
even eat the flesh of cow. However when he joined Sahib
Bandgi why did the others protested against him. Why did
it happen? This is not a bad community. It has two
principles -Truth and Non-violence. Then where are we
wrong. Then there came this opposition. This was surely


240 Sahib Bandgi
not a wrong path isn’t it? The thing was that phonies
thought that he has now joined Sahib Bandgi, he will take
the others also there and it would create hindrance in their
methods and earnings that's why he was protested.
You will be definitely opposed because people don't
want you to follow the right path. I can assure you that
after receiving Naam Dhaan from me the economic
condition of a person also improves. This is due to fact that
I will make you abandon the reasons which puts you in
poverty, they are meat and alcohol.
Now people can't stop themselves from chewing bones.
Now you do not like this. Therefore relatives are turning
away from you. You don't want to visit relatives who
consume meat .they say that they have left you .but it not
them who have left you, it is you who have left them
.hence, they are protesting you.
For 100-200 bottles of alcohols there are huge queues
but the healthy milk is sold in every street but no one gives
any attention to it.
So we are being decried by the alcoholics and meat
consuming peoples. Never expect from an alcoholic that he
will do the right thing. You have left committing sins.
They want you to keep committing them. Till the time the
world has Sinners there will be your opposition and it will
keep on happening as the sinners will never diminish. Till
the time this earth remains there will be good people as
well as the opposition in the form of bad people.
There is a small Ashram in Ramgarh. There are many
followers there. There is no place left even for parking.
Someone said that when we park on the road then the
people abuse. They say that I have made them rich. Now
everyone has a car. I just want to state that after Naam the
state of poverty starts diminishing. The most important
thing is that you are contended.
I visit all Ashrams. They are well equipped. Some are
managed by poor devotees they cannot even offer 100


Changing the world spiritually 241
paisa, even they those Ashrams run well. All wonders as to
how these ashrams are being run and feel sad.
............so the world is wondering that in Sahib Bandgi the
number of ill and poor persons is so much and how did
they made 225 Ashrams in such a short time span. Just
because of the flow of little money they are getting
agitated. Now this change is the main reason for
protestation. They are those people who out of jealousy
opposing us.
You have stopped being spendthrift and your diseases
have decrement. We have told you the ways to keep
yourself healthy which have resulted in less illness. You
don't wander without any reason. Your economic condition
has improved. Then why is this protest? You are not
creating trouble for anyone by any means. Every Naami is
living the life of a Mahatma. You are not cheating anyone.
Then what is the reason?
I gave an instance. People don't want you to follow the
path of truth and you do not do good work Then what type
of people are they. This is an eon of jealousy. No one is
bothered by this that why they themselves don't have these
good qualities, why other should have such goodness, this
is bothering them. They are drowning in sorrows while
watching others happiness. Therefore the people will try to
discomfort you.
There is a person whose name is Kamal Singh. Initially,
he was a very dangerous person. He was a brutal hunter.
He used to eat anything. He contained all the evil habits.
He bought a piece of land and then built houses, and three
shops, he became good. He also opened a hotel in which
his wife used to prepare food and he himself used to serve
because he was of opinion that the cooks are not pure they
consumes things like alcohol and meat.
If the devil like him was converted into good, then a
thanks is in order or a condemnation. It means these type
of people doesn't want you out of this evil deeds. Now you


242 Sahib Bandgi
are unable to commit sins even if you want to. You have
become a better person. If you take a look at your former
life you will see that there has come a great difference
between your doing and living. You are transformed, you
have become a Mahatma.
There is a priest in Kashi. He teaches Brahmins. Kashi is
the capital of Hindu religion. There are very intelligent
persons in Kashi. One day they came to me. They had been
brought by an illiterate Naami. The priest bowed to me and
said maharaja, this student of yours when I saw him I came
to you. He is even above a Mahatma. He never lies. We are
gyanis but even then we sometimes lie. His character is
also very pure. He doesn't talk unnecessarily. He earns by
fair means and is calm and satisfied. He has 2-3 children
but he is so much satisfied that even a Paramgyani can't be
that much contended. We are gyanis but even we
sometimes kill beings but he doesn’t. I saw him and then I
thought about who have transformed him. So even gyanis
is talking like that about our Naamis. I have told you
before that no good person is decrying us. Only the bad
people are opposed. They can't see the power of Naam.
Ask my any Naami whether there is any change in him
after Naam Dhaan or not. Your deeds change, your heart
iluminates and you won't be hurting any being. You are not
doing any sinful deeds and your memory is upgraded.
Thirdly, you will get a protector; there is no worry because
you know that Sahib wills everything as he is the one
doing.
Teri Kripa Se Hi Mera, Sab Kaam Ho Raha Hai.
Karte Ho Tum Hi Sahiba, Mera Naam Ho Raha Hai.
You have seen things at many events. Now you are not
wandering or lost. Although others try to confuse and force
you to believe in planets, spirits but you are firm on your
belief.
I got a call from Astha channel from Mumbai. They told
me that some people don't want your show to go on air as


Changing the world spiritually 243
their show was losing its limelight in front our show.
Because in front of your words the value of their words is
decreasing. Anand Joshi stated it clearly that Mahatma says
that if he does air our programs then they will not be
allowing their programs on air. No one is watching their
programs.
We haven't made efforts to cut any one's show on TV,
and others are demanding to cancel ours. What type of
people are they? This needs a thought, I am worrying
myself over them. My whole program is live. One said to
me that he wants to read my literature. I told him that you
wouldn't be able to. He thought that it must be an
enormous literature. He enquired how much is it? I replied
my whole Sangat is my literature, read them. My every
Naami is a page of my literature. Study Mohanlal that how
he was before and after Naam Dhaan. Study Lehar Singh
that how he was before and after Naam Dhaan. Study the
youngsters, how their character turned out to become good.
........so lots many occupations got affected by me. On
Ranjhadi turn there was a poultry farm. He used to decry at
me a lot. I asked my people that he is not even a sayana
than what does he has to do with me? They replied that you
have destroyed him. He made two kothis from the earnings
from his poultry farm. Now his business has diminished. A
lot of alcoholics and meat lovers used to go to him. Every
day he used to earn minimum 2000 rupees. But now his
earnings become less. So he was letting out his frustration.
Some are not able to reach me so they let out their
frustration. Sometimes they say that I am a Muslim,
sometimes they associate me with Schedule caste and
sometimes they say that I have changed religion. If you
focus on him then you will see that he will not be good at
personal level. They have accepted the fact that we are not
eating chicken and also we are not calling anyone for
festival.


244 Sahib Bandgi
With the deep enquiry, faith, and seriousness our
Naamis are associated with us; there is no other community
which has such deep relation with its followers. You
remain firm and do not worry about the protest. Just keep
going with Naam.
Tu Naam Sumar Jag Ladne De....
They are a strong and dangerous team. They also have
fear. Hence, we also have people after our life. But we are
not getting scared. Jab Aukhali Mein Sir Diya| To Moosalo Se
Kya Darna. and _‘_ Nachan Nikli To Ghunghat Kaisa| _’_ If the
occupation is that of dancer then you have to show face.
Getting in to the devotion of Sahib is not an easy affair; it’s
to be done with a bang. Everything is clear. Therefore they
will go to any extent. How do they plan? If Kamal Singh’s
wife had a headache. Firstly he was an alcoholic and a
meat lover. After Naam he transformed and opened a
Dhaba. Then the phonies arrived and told him to believe in
spirits and things like that. They play around with you.
Mujhe Hai Kaam Satguru Se, Duniya Ruthee To Ruthan De.
They say that your mother who has passed away has
come back. There is tug of war between the mother and
daughter in law. That’s why she has headache. Then they
say that when you four brothers will sit only then it will
pass away. They know that Kamal Singh will not come by
himself. So the brother told him to come. Kamal Singh told
them to come to Sahib. They replied that he is a Muslim.
Kamal Singh said that we are Hindus, we are not
consuming alcohol and meat. Then they said that he
belongs to schedule caste. My Gurudev always told me
never to mention my caste because a Sanyasi doesn't have
any caste. Then his brother said you don't even care about
your own mother, if you can't be of her then you wouldn't
be of anyone else. Do it for the happiness of mother. We
have to sacrifice a goat and contribute a thousand rupees
on each side.
No, this was a plan. No deity eats goat. Sahib says-


Changing the world spiritually 245
Mansahari Manva Pratyaksh Rakshash Jaan.
Uski Sangat Na Kro, Hoye Bhakti Mein Hani.
Therefore that tanrik divided his own community, so that
we can not bring others. I said that who are they to tear us
apart, we have already teared them from us. They are a
clever bunch of people. I know them, they will create
troubles for you and also in your devotion. Niranjan is
attacking you from both sides internally and externally.
There is a priestess who was able to get a clean bill from
anywhere. After Naam when she became alright then
phony began to say that she is a witch and was eating a
heart of a child under a tree. She came to me crying and
said that when I go to fetch water then women stay away
from me. I replied that isn't it a good things then. Further,
when my children go to school, the other children don’t sit
near them. I am in trouble here and you are enjoying it. I
asked her that, is there people around you who are troubled
by the spirits. She replied yes. I asked her to bring those
who suffer from evil effects to me.
........Therefore they can go to any limit. If there is a boy
then they say that he has born in gandmool-bad time. If the
answer is that we have taken Naam then they reply that you
are a Naami your child is not, the boy has born in
gandmool so the restrictions are on it. Means they will turn
you to their view. Therefore, I prohibit all this after Naam
Dhaan.
...... The world will try to cut you off (from sahib bandgi).
A lady brought her daughter with her and told me that she
has a fault. I asked her whether she taken Naam. She
replied yes. For people like this there is only one word -
phony. Actually that girl had some disease. Here the
phonies spread their web and told them other reason to
confuse them. Even for headache they say that spirits have
taken over them. They are doing their work like this. The
girl said that her mother took her to a sayana. He beat me. I
told the lady that at the time of Naam Dhaan I mentioned


246 Sahib Bandgi
not to do such work. She replied I didn't want to. The
neighbors, uncles and relatives took her to him by force.
They had been wandering about 6 months.
Then she came to me. Will Sahib help them? No. pay
attention to the reason.
Naam Peev Ka Chhadi Ke, Kare Aan Ki Aas.
Veshya Tera Pootra, Kahe Kaun Ko Baap.
If wife leaves after being angry then it’s okay. She had
gone to her paternal home. If she doesn't come for 1 month,
two months or 6 months then it’s not a problem to worry.
However, if she takes another husband then how is it. Then
even her husband will leave her, he will not associate
himself with her. This comes under the category of
sharanagati or submission.
Sukh Mein Tujhe Na Bhulun, Dukh Mein Na Har Manu.
Aisa Prabhav Bhar De, Mere Adhir Man Mein.
No matter what the sorrows and happiness is, but never
worry.
A lady acted as a mediator for Naam Dhaan to 100- 150
persons in Chinnaur. She has her own school. She is very
much consistent in connecting people to the devotion of
Sahib. One day she came to me in a very troubled state.
We share your troubles. She said that there is a Peepal tree.
Someone spread the rumor that there lives a Dayan under
that tree who was eating a heart of a child. Second day
there weren't even 50 students in the school. The reason is
clear. The old ladies are very religious, they pay great
attention to the pilgrimages, and they believe anyone. They
are innocent and not much intelligent. They haven't been to
school ever. So they didn't let their grandchildren come to
school, they said that beat drum by a sayana and get rid of
it. Now that lady has two sons, one of them is a Naami and
other is not. She was saying that her son says that we
should do as suggested. I said that if we do that then I have
connected so many people to devotion of Sahib; if I will do
that then whole work will fail. People will say that she


Changing the world spiritually 247
herself believes in them. So I told her to bring her son to
me. I told him to make people understand by going to their
houses. He said you are right but people don't believe. So
he went to each house but still the school lacked 50- 60
students.
How is world? If one of ours becomes ill then they say
that Sahib has not treated them better. And if someone dies
then what to say. King Dashrath when he sent his son on
exile he drowned so much in sorrow that he lost his eyes
by crying. No one can save them from kaal. Even if a
person goes down with fever the people say that he joined
Sahib Bandgi that's why they became ill.
We have made you focus on a point, not to leave Sahib.
There will be lot of problems but don't leave Sahib, keep a
strong hold on him.
Rahimana Dhaga Prem Ka, Mat Todo Chatkaye.
Tute Te Phir Na Jude, Jude Ganth Pad Jaye.
The world will turn away from you but you need to hold
onto Sahib.
Khelna Ho To Kheliye, Pakka Hokar Khel.
Kachi Sarson Per Ke, Khadi Bhaya Na Tel.
One said that he is afraid of me. We don't need to tell
you anything. The things that come out of your mouth are
the similar ones.
We have another type of computer. We are not talking
about the earnings; we are just saying that you to take care
of what we have given you.
The attack could be from anywhere from your own
house or from the neighbors.
They want you to follow the old path so that they can
have control over you. They won't say that you have
become good; they will say that you have left deities. The
offence is very great. They themselves are thieves and
consume meat and alcohol. They are not devotees. They
are the majority, alcoholics. There used to be only one
alcoholic in a village whom villagers didn’t like too much.


248 Sahib Bandgi
There was only one thief who used to earn of abuse of
others. Now even the number of thieves has increased. The
era now is roller coaster, downward; you need not to be
disheartened.
I went to the house of one Rooplal. There 3-4 people spit
on the vehicle. It happened approximately for half an hour
but they didn't have the guts to come outside. A good
person does not act that way. I asked Rooplal who are
they? He replied they are the sayana on whom I have
wasted lakh of rupees but they weren't able to treat, but
from the moment I come to you I am fine.
I have opposed these phonies. The sayana fear this thing.
No evil spirit can stand in front of Naam of Sahib. They
only talk in group so that the glory of Sahib diminishes.
We have never cheated anyone, but still this world is cruel
and critical. The hindrance on the path has many bumps,
and the phonies disposed by me have also grown in
number. In the future, they will hide. Right now they are
prompting people to not join Sahib Bandgi. We have made
people human, made them live. Don’t worry there is a lot
of power in the devotion of Sahib. This power is
incredible; therefore keep this in mind-
Mujhe Hai Kaam Satguru Se, Duniya Ruthe To Ruthan De.

Surati Samhale Kaaj Hai, Tu Mat Bharam Bhulaye.
Maan Sayyad Manasa Lahar Mein, Bahat Katahun Na Jaye.
Kabir sahib is saying that we need to be vigilant of our
mind because it keeps distracting us from the correct path.
Also we need to keep our concentration from wandering
away in order to move in the direction of salvation.
Bhut Pishach Hoy Sab Niyaara| Adbhut Naam Sada Rakhvara||
If you have taken a Naam from Satguru then, Naam will

## 13 People make many weighted queries.

*Some question that, Didn't Param Purush knew that
Niranjan would hurt the beings. Then why did he grant him
Souls?
My reply is that the Souls has been provided in strong
protection that Niranjan would not be able to hurt them.
*Some say that, isn’t giving a curse to swallow one lakh
beings is a punishment for the Soul?
No, this is only a punishment for Mind. Soul is not hurt in
any way. It is safe.
*Some say that, Can't Param Purush set Souls free?
It could be done in a moment but then won't his word will
nullify the boon to Niranjan, the reign of 17 chaukdi
infinite yugas.
*Some ask that what was the fault of the Soul.
That's why you will get a chance to go to that country.
*Which beings wanderers’ lust?
Whoever will get Naam Dhaan from us will eventually
come on his straight intended path. But your main aim
should be not to take birth again. If you are not on right
track then you will get signals. You are being protected
then why wander? A Mother gives proper care to her child,
feeding him, bathing him, milk feeding and also provide
protection. But even then she could commit a mistake but
this protective power accompanying you would never
commit a mistake. You could pin point the changes in
yourself. If you commit a mistake and Sahib abandons you
then know that Niranjan has won. Sahib won't leave you,
he will leave you only after improvising you. He will not
tell you to go die. You will commit less mistakes as long as
you are in the shadow of Niranjan.
*Can Param Purush hear us?
Someone asked me when we are in pain and we cry out for
God then can he hear us or are we in the darkness?
I replied that the cries of these worldly people only goes till
Niranjan. These cries are to get rid of physical worries.


250 Sahib Bandgi
These are related to Niranjan. Soul has no relation in
context to mind. All these things are provided by Niranjan
so that you think that your wish has been heard by God
himself. But he won't give you the knowledge of Soul only
the materialistic things. Instance of Nachiketa must have
heard by you. His father was a king. He was giving old
cows as alms. Nachiketa didn't approved of this. He had
the idea that good things should be given in alms. He asked
his father that when his father would will give him as
alms? His Father ignored him. But when he began to repeat
the question again and again his father replied agitatedly
go! I give you to death. He then reached Chitragupta.
Yamraj said you are full of justice, you have come the
wrong way, I am happy with you, ask anything you want.
He replied that he wants the knowledge of Soul. Yamraj
replied that he can't give him that he can give him anything
other than that. Means that even the king of three loks can't
give the knowledge of the Soul. What we want is not given
by Satguru and what Satguru is giving us we are not
willing to take. The worldly people only wish for
materialistic things. People are working for their money
and dynasty. Identify them. Brahmnand says-
Koi Hamse Poochhe Yun Akar, Uniya Mein Tumne Kya Dekha.
Hum Batla Denge Yun Usko, Sab Matlab Ka Mela Dekha.
Hum Matlab Ke Tum Matlab Ke, Ye Matlab Ke Wo Matlab Ke.
Gulistan Mein Phool Khila Tha, Humne Dekha Matlab Ka.
Yogi Dekhe Jangam Dekhe, Peele Kapde Wale Dekhe.
Pa Gale Mein Unke Haar Pada Tha, Humne Dekha Matlab Ka.
*Some query whether won't he (Niranjan) hurt us whom
we were worshipping before?
When someone queried this, I replied in negative. A goat
got lost in a forest. There are many hunters out there. She
straight went to Lion and asked for his protection which
was promised to her by the Lion. He then made an
announcement in the forest, not to hurt the goat. After that
the goat wandered the forest in harmony. So this is the


Changing the world spiritually 251
same fundamental. Nobody ever mentioned that I used to
worship Hanuman ji and now he is hurting me. We are not
against the Shashtras. So have faith. We are saying-
Devi Deval Jagat Mein, Kotik Pooje Koye.
Satguru Ki Pooja Kiye, Sabki Pooja Koye.
Some people say that you are worshipping a human rather
than deities. Firstly, watch where Shashtras are pointing.
We are not decrying anyone. We are just saying that these
are the messengers of the Niranjan. Vedas mention-
Dhyan Moolam Guru Roopam, Pooja Moolam Guru Padkam.
Mantra Moolam Guru Vakyam, Moksh Moolam Guru Kripa.
*A man asked, the Naam given by you cannot spoken nor
it is a subject of sound but it can be uttered by us.
I replied that you have misunderstood. Now electricity
flows through the wire. This is the similar mechanism.
*Some people say that a Women's Guru is her husband.
Then why does she need to have a Guru?
A women complained to me that her husband doesn't let
her come to Satsang. He consumes alcohol and meat.
When I come here he says that a women's Guru is her
husband. I told her to bring him to me. She replied that he
doesn't come. I told her to do bhajan for which she replied
that her husband doesn't let her do it. What type of
explanation is that surely he is not creating a barrier in her
breaths that is creating disturbance in bhajan? They came
to Ranjadi for some relative's marriage. That lady
somehow brought her husband to me after his numerous
protests. When he arrived I was discussing the necessity of
Guru. I said that Shashtras mention that you can't crossover
without the guidance of a Guru. For that he replied there is
no Guru for a women. I asked him that where had he read
this? Where is it mentioned that a women's husband is her
Guru. He was just echoing same thing again and again. I
understood that I am facing a perverse. I asked him-have
you heard of Lord Shiva? He replied-yes. Do you know his
wife's name? He replied-Parvati. I further asked who Guru


252 Sahib Bandgi
of Parvati is. He replied in negative. I told him that
Parvati's Guru is Narad ji. If the wife of lord Shiva had to
have a Guru then what is a mere human thinking. I then
asked him-have you heard of Ram ji? He said-yes. What is
the name of his wife? He replied-Sita ji. When I enquired
about Sita's Guru he didn't had any answer. Then I told him
that it was Vashisht muni. Ram ji never said to her that I
am your Guru. In the end the person is again saying that a
women has no Guru. I told him that there was an
unemployed person in Delhi. His wife had a cow and she
fed her family by selling milk. One day the man announced
that I will give the cow to that person who would make me
understand the 18th chapter of Gita. The lady protested by
saying that, what will we eat then? He replied that don't
worry, no one would be able to do the task. The lady said
that majority people are coming from Kashi and pleaded
with him not to do this. He said you need not to be worried.
When somebody will explain it to me I will just reply that I
didn't understand. So I told to that person that same
situation is with you. Shashtra say- Dhyan Moolam Guru
Roopam. Therefore the people who are saying this doesn't
know anything about Shashtra. Even if you worship for a
major time period you can't reach Paramatma without
Guru. Ramayana has also mentioned the importance and
necessity of the Guru.
Guru Bin Bhav Nidhi Tarai Na Koi,
Hari Viranchi Shankarsam Hoi.
Brihaspati was the Guru of Lord Shiva. Similarly, Agni
was the Guru of Lord Brahma.
Ram Krishna Se Kau Bada, Tin Bhi To Guru Keen.
Teen Lok Ke Nayaka, Guru Aage Adhin.
After reading the Shashtras one can understand the
importance of the Guru. But imposters won't let you go
toward the Gurus.
Guru Ko Taje Bhaje Jo Aana, Ta Manush Ko Photak Gyana.

## 14 You have Become Different in this world.

We are witnessing a complete transformation of
devotion. Several communities (Caste, Class, Countries
linguistic, and Religion) got blended in to our path. But
society never blended the followers of Sahib Bandagi in
itself with a welcome heart. Sometimes the question must
arise-Why such aversion? This thought must have come to
your mind.
Your ideals are not matching with anyone. All the other
communities present there have been accepted by the
society but your community has not. It is same as giving
affiliation. Someone said about us, we are not Muslim nor
Christians, Neither are they Arya Samaji nor Sanatani.
What are we? To understand this community it is difficult,
he said.
The difference is only that you are stronger with the
inner vision. The question then arises whether that is why
the society unable to assimilate us? Others have
compromised their ideals with the society which we have
not. The communities which have compromised with the
society have weakened because they have followed in to
the footsteps of vicious deeds of the society. Therefore
they decline.
The question that arises is where are you at fault?
Listen, firstly, we hear “what is the method of devotion?”
only this. What are the reason for their protests? We are
telling you to be truthful, not to consume meat and alcohol,
to earn by fair means, not to steal, no gambling and have a
pure character (one Life Partner). Which of these principles
are going against the society? There is nothing inimical to
be protested. There is no divergent principle which is being
followed by us. We have simplified the methodology of
devotion to the supreme Lord, Param Purush. All the
communities have certain rules and regulations. All the
religions have two Divisions (Some in hundreds) which are
constantly at each other throat. Among Muslims there are


254 Sahib Bandgi
two Divisions Shiya and Suni, they have huge wedge
between them. What is the reason for this? Shiya looks
upto two prophets out of six which is the main reason for
this feud. Secondly Suni believes that Shiya before giving
anyone food or water they firstly spit into it. By doing this
they believe it to be a sign of brotherhood.
Accusations made on me are by the great Masterminds.
The people who are protesting are doing under the power
of their Master Minds. This idea is not theirs own. Hence,
there is this protests. The feud between the two is very
deep. Similarly among Hindus also, Arya Samaji and
Sanatani have great conflicts. In Jainism also there is
raging conflict between Shwetamber and Peetamber. Just
like that we have communities parallel to us which are
vegetarians and are talking about Param Purush.
The question arises, is it why they have not been
protested? It happened in the beginning. After that they got
assimilated in the society. You have not been assimilated
in it. We are able to assimilate the society into us. Those
who protest know the fundamentals behind it better than
you do. They thought that if we succeed in our path then
their own shops will shut down. I have faced. Protest is
far worse than that for Dayanand Saraswati. I have faced it
even in much more greater scale. Where ever there is my
disciple, I have been opposed. Why society assimilate
these communities that were parallel to us? They were
weak, and they have compromised values and accepted the
propositions of the society. They accepted the
fundamentals of voodoos, spirits, stars, planets and
enchantments. In time, their own color faded and they were
colored with the colors of society. Now there is only a
stamp. I have stopped this viciousness from spreading by
my own power.
I have created awakening by reaching every corner. I
have not compromised. The ones who didn't accepted the
viciousness present in the society, were outcastes from the


Changing the world spiritually 255
society. I was worried that we don't end up like them
because if that happened then our ship will sink. That
section of the society that confuses others and entangles
them in the web. I was aware of all this. Secondly, you
have this spiritual power. If you look around yourself, you
will see that all the others are doing things like giving
sacrifices, voodoos, spirits and other things.
Whatever I say is right. I am cautious towards lies. By
eating meat, health deteriorates and by lying intelligence
diminishes. They are not synchronized. The restrictions
placed on you are hardships. To follow the path of Sahib is
not at all an easy task. It is not a Child’s play. The person
with my Naam will hesitate and taste fear to do wrong. The
things I am saying to you have been first invoked on
myself.
Our parallel communities are talking on the same
lineage as ours. But they are not being opposed. Arya
Samaji are not following the deities (Sagun). They are not
being opposed. Then why are we being protested? We are
not following stars, planets, spirits, voodoos or
enchantments.
Tantra Mantra Sab Jhoot Hai, Mat Bharmo Koye.
Sar Naam Paye Bina, Kaga Hans Na Hoye.
We asked not to believe in these things. This is the main
reason, they are angry. They believe that those things are
strong. I am saying this after a deep investigation. I have
no desire to increase the number of Disciple by giving then
Naam Diksha. I do not compel you to focus on meditation,
nor even to serve me. I do not consider these as important.
Those who wish can do that, no compulsion. If with one
pointed resolve the norms are followed it will strengthen
your devotion.
Khelna Ho To Kheliye, Pakka Hokar Khel.
Kachi Sarson Per Ke, Khadi Bhaya Na Tel.
This section is worried their philosophy is deep rooted
and they force the society. They have a grip over the


256 Sahib Bandgi
society. Their people are at higher positions of authority
and carry out this work. They have established strong
channel and forces themselves on others by these powers.
Therefore I have to exercise caution. When doubt arise you
can make enquiry by contacting on phone. My followers
are cautious about ritualists and they should, otherwise
they will be deceived. They will try to take you towards
their beliefs and practices but you should ignore them.
There will always be opposition for you, if you refuse their
advice, but you be fearless and firm. Till the time there are
cheats in the world there will be opponents. Somehow they
want to take you back to the devotion of Niranjan. I have
given you an excellent devotion. You are being attacked by
Niranjan both internally and externally therefore you must
be cautious.
Followers of other religions will try to confuse, this
section will try to create fear of plants, spirits or voodoos
etc. They will quote some selected verses of Sadus in their
favour and try to confuse you and take you in to their
confidence, you should be careful. They will invite you to
take your part in wrong worship ask you to believe in
effects of Planets. If you refuse and move away they may
even become shamelessly violent. They accepted our
success, therefore they take to such tactics. We shall
remain cautious. Our community do not accept these
things. I started many movements so as to save the
devotion from any harm. What are we saying? The
foremost basic thing is the truth. When somebody joins us
there are seven rules to be followed. To be truthful, not to
consume meat and alcohol, not to gamble, being a pure
character, no stealing and earning by fair means. According
to me none of these rules are against society. And we are
talking about the equality and humanity. We are not
following the concept of castes unlike some groups.
A journalist asked me what your accomplishments are. I
replied that I have two big achievements. From Kashmir to


Changing the world spiritually 257
all the way to Kanya kumari numerous people from small
sections to higher group, we have given devotion of Sahib
and succeeded in creating awareness in a big scale. I have a
count (up to year 2005) of up to 75 thousand Brahmins, 75
thousand Mahajans and 75 thousand Thakurs. I have made
them understand what devotion is and they are following
that path of Satya Bhakti.
Devotional attitude is very well established in us, there
is no place to oppose this. Society, Religion and Humans
are fighting on three references. First one is that the world
is fighting over the form of the God. Someone is vouching
on Lord Shiva and another one is on Hanuman ji. World is
not fighting over the fact that whether there is God or not.
This fact has been accepted by whole world. The conflict is
only on the form.
Koi Kahe Haluka Koi Kahe Garua.
Then there is conflict on his residence that where does
he reside.
Poorv Disha Hari Ko Vasa, Paschim Allah Mukama.
Dil Mein Khojo Dil Mein Khojo, Yahin Karima Rama.
Means there is fight over his residency.
Koi Kahe Kashi Koi Kahe Mathura, Koi Kabe Kailash Batave.
Third conflict is over what is the path leading towards
him.
Koi Kahe Karm Adhina,Koi Kahe Bhagya Adhina.
Why an intelligent being does is fighting over these
concepts? Can Shastras help us with these conflicts? Yes,
first concept is about the form of Paramatma, Eswar. This
has been mentioned in the Shashtras. There is no conflict
over this subject. The reason for conflict here is somewhat
different. Shashtras contain-
Jete Drishyam Tete Anityam, Jete Adrishyam Tete Nityam.
He is beyond the universe, beyond senses, beyond words
and beyond five elements-tatvas. Then why there is
conflict? He can not be known with the help of senses then


258 Sahib Bandgi
this conflict is a waste. Now, second conflict is regarding
the residency. Sahib says-
Tu Maoko Kahan Dhoonde Re Bande, Main To Tere Pas Mein.
Na Main Deval Na Main Masjid, Nahin Kabe Kailas Mein.
Bhanvar Gufa Mein Main Na Rehta, Nahin Anhad Ke Vaas
Mein.
Khoji Hoye Turat Mil Jaun, Ek Palak Talash Mein,
Kehat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Har Swanso Ki Swans Mein.
Vedas mentions that God resides in us, similarly, Gita
also states that Arjun, he resides within your Soul. So
where is the conflict? The reason is that human are being
manipulated and has been woven into a web. Ramayana
states-
Prakarti Paar Prabhu Sarv Ur Vaasi.
Then why are you wandering lost? On this topic, Sants
have protested, which have resulted in the end of some
Sants lives. Is there any guidance on the path to reach
there? Yes.
Koi Kahe Tap Hai Sara, Koi Kahe Bhagya Anusara.
Koi Kahe Gyan Hai Bhai, Koi Kahe Karm Bas Aai.
What is the way, Guru is the way. Some people
comment that you are worshiping a mere human rather
than deities. Ignorant will behave like this. I am not saying
things which would vilify, from Rig-Veda to the sayings of
Mahapurush one can witness the glory of Guru. (Pooja
Moolam Guru Padukam)
So the one doing protests is also doing the evil deeds.
We are true Sanatani. They are cheating, eating meat and
also comment, that we have abandoned our religion. We
are earning by fair means and also not consuming meat and
alcohol. We are living through a hard work. I am not scared
of you. To which religion do you follow and which deity
belong to you. I am not ruthless. We are speaking Truth.
You should say that the followers of Sahib Bandagi are
such fair people. But you are going against the flow. You
are saying that we have abandoned religion where you are
the one who are doing all kind of wrong things.


Changing the world spiritually 259
Niranjan Dhan Tumro Darbar. Rang Mahal Mein Base
Maskhare,
Pas Tere Sardar. Beshya Odhe Khasa Malamal,
Gal Motiyan Ke Haar. Pativrata Ko Mile Na Khadi,
Rukha Niras Ahar. Pakhandi Ko Jag Mein Adar,
Sach Ko Kahein Labar.Dhoor Dhoop Mein Sadhu Viraje,
Bhaye Jo Bhavnidhi Paar. Niranjan Dhan Turo Darbar.
Sahib Says-
Kabir Kalyug Aa Gaya, Sant Na Pooje Koye.
Kami Krodhi Aalsi, Inki Pooja Hoye.
Therefore the people who are saying such things we say
that they are the ones who are sinful deeds. Don't pay
attention to them, just carry on with your own work. A man
sitting on the elephant has no need to get irritated himself
from a dog's barking.
We are not creating trouble for anyone. If someone
organizes a rally then we don't block their roads.
Unjustified behavior has been shown towards us. Our 12
Ashrams have been burnt. Wherever they see our posters
they rip them off. But we have good thoughts and resolves.
I have read a great deal about persons related to various
communities and castes during my 24 year service. I had
people belonging to all the panths in the Army. I had an
important job there also. I was a P.C. instructor. This was
done in army school. The persons who take J.O.C. course
come there. I used to teach them and make them
understand the concepts. I didn't find any spiritual
awareness in them. They talked about Santhood but at the
back they used to consume meat and alcohol. Furthermore,
they were abusing others verbally. They had no control
over their tongue, mind and senses. We observe people
doing very contrary deeds. You can see these type of
people in your neighborhood. They are doing whatever
pleases them. They may dislike your way of devotion, may
insult you be cautious, stick to your purity.
Because, all these are communities of Kal. Many who
are talking about Kabir Sahib are in reality the panths of


260 Sahib Bandgi
Kal. Because Niranjan had requested Param Purush to
grant him control over 12 panths of Sahib. Hence, they talk
about Kabir Sahib but the fundamentals are of Niranjan.
Stamp is of Kabir Sahib but Naam is of Niranjan. This all
is done to confuse the humans so that not many will to go
to Amarlok. Sahib thought that the ones with the true
Naam will attain salvation and if all leave then the world of
Niranjan will be empty which would cancel out the
boon/word given of Param Purush. Therefore Param
Purush agreed to this play. Therefore the people of these
pants will not go to Amarlok. They are wandering here and
there (In Kal’s Worlds). They don't have a true Naam.
They have Naam related to form (kaya)
bounded by 52 words. But the Naam given to you is not a
subject of sound.
.....So they themselves are lost and thus distraughting you
in the process. I have never caused trouble to anyone but
they cause inconvenience to me as a collective front.
Therefore, why is the society not assimilated us? We are
also not very keen on that. Others have been assimilated
after some compromise. But we are not compromising our
rules for them. How did people got entangled in this
vicious web? The phony section forced those matts to
become like that. Then where is the conflict with us? I say
never accept death of Ideology. The things we are having
faith are not approved by them. There are a lot of
superstitions in the society. Humans are forced to follow.
Everyone is against us. Because there is no more life in
other panths. What type of Santhood is this? They do all
kind of things. My Naami if they do such act, I dot accept
them again. They will force you and after entangling you
will take you away. But my Naami is not doing this. He
has become pure.
Sometimes you must have thought that where have you
reached.....at such a place which you had never imagined.
You got internal satisfaction from this. You have become


Changing the world spiritually 261
amiable Souls. No one is more amiable Soul than you, very
rare to find. If you will see yourslf you will fall in love
with yourself. You won’t be tied to anyone else. Because
you have become rare in this world. Your personality has
turned serene. The World is unleashed but you have things
under your control. You are conscious and blissful whereas
the world is unconscious. How much should I say, only
that you have become a Celestial Swan-Hansa a Sadhu.

Simple-Path of Grace
Sant Kabir Sahib says-
‘Adakar Khuud Khajane Se, Chhuda Le Apne Bande Ko.’
Sahib asks the Guru to release the disciple with Guru’s
own power from this worldly entanlements.

Hari Kripa Jo Hoye To, Nahin Hoye To Nahin.
Kahain Kabir Guru Kripa Bin, Sakal Buddhi Bah Jahin.
It hardly matters whether one attains the grace of God or
not, but the grace of Satguru is very much essential for
Parm Moksh, Paramanent salvation.
_“Pooja Moolam Guru Padhukam”_
Worship the lotus feet of Guru- Veda

Devi Dewal Jagat Mein, Kotik Poojey Koye.
Satguru Ki Pooja Kiye, Sabb Ki Pooja Hoye.
He who worships a Satguru need not worship crores of
deities because in the worship of a Satguru-Satya bhakti
alone lies the worship of all. Satguru will not ask us to go
to Devi Devatas or Sadhana Kamayee-Earn through
asturities, Satguru’s grace is enough.
