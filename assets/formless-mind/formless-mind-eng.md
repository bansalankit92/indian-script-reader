## Few Words

```
Sayyad Ke Kaboo Mey Hey Sab Jiv Bicharey||
(All are prisoners of Mind)
```
Once, I happened to read an article in India Today
magazine. It was about famous quote of the year. It was the
quote from Mr. Alexander, P.A. of then American President
Ronal Regan. He has written- I feel that all of us who live in
this world are plaything in the hands of a great destructive
power. I think we are under the control of an evil force.
Whenever it wants, it can turn the thoughts of all the people
in one direction at the same time. It can change the thinking
of the people of the world. I feel it is taking the people of
the world on a destructive path.
What a significant statement. It is the result of churning
of his thought. I think he has read the words of Kabir Sahib
and if it is not so, I am thankful for his statement that such a
Nobel thought has come to him. Sahibji says-
_Maan Tarang Mey Jagat Bhulana||_
The whole world floats on the waves of the Mind, it is
under the direction of Mind that all anti Spirit (Anatma)
work are being carried out. This is happening because no
one could comprehend the networking of Mind. This Mind
itself is Kalpurush. This Mind is taking everyone on the
destructive path. Not knowing the Mind, all are engaged
ignorantly in sinful deeds, mind compel us for such sinful
acts. Engaged in devotion to Mind, they move into the
mouth of Kalpurush because it does not allow anyone to
take up true Bhakti- devotion of Satya Purush (the supreme
lord of eternal world). Kalpurush (formless God of this
universe), instead engages everyone in the devotion to
himself.
_Akatha Katha Ya Man hi Ki, Kahe Kabir Samuzaay|

T h e Forml e s s M i n d **5**

## 1. Formless mind!

While imparting Adhyatmic knowledge, worldly Sant
Mahapurushas says that in this Sansar (Worldly ocean of
life), Jivas are bound with the bodily-related Karmas. All
the Mahatmas, Rishis, Muni, Peer, Paigambar, Auliya and
Human incarnation of Devis and Devtas; they give only the
knowledge on duty of action and its consequences (pleasure
or pain to the Body). Due to ignorance they all say that
Atma-Spirit is traped in the birth & death cycle and
entangled in bondage.None of them gives the Adhyatmic-
Spiritual Wisdom that Niranjan-Mind keeps all in Ignorance
and under bondage. The one who gives the pleasure of
Heaven-Vaikunth, Jannat, and the pain of Hell is the Lord
of the three worlds Niranjan, the formless Mind. The one,
who gives all kinds of fears and illusions, engages in action,
and rewards its fruit is none other than the formless Mind.
Mind imprisons the spark of Parampurush, the eternal
Hansa-Atma and with the power of Atma, it does all
Karmas (In this three worlds of Maya, Atma is the
fundamental source of all abilities but it is in the control of
Mind). Nirakar Mind-Kalpurush is the immortal son of
Parampurush by his eternal word (Shabda Putra). However,
after obtaining boon from the Parampurush, he created this
three worlds, he created lives of pain and pleasure,
deceptively and fraudulently against the wishes of
Parampurush and becomes its Lord. By misusing the boon
and by deception,including Adya Shakti he subjugate each
& every Soul and with her assistance he created the three
worlds of life and imprison the Soul. They(Niranjan &
Adya Shakti) made Jivas out of Hans-Atmas and put them
in the wombs of 84 lakhs of life forms and engaged them in
the repeated Birth and death. It is for this reason;
Parampurush (the Supreme Lord) cursed Niranjan saying
that he will never return to Amarlok. Niranjan as Mind has


**6 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
bound the Atmas in the bodies of life forms and entangled
in pleasures and Karmas, so that, the Jivas were unable to
realize their own identity & remain ignorant. There are no
curses on the Hansas, they are entitled to return to Amarlok
and have right to salvation. Atma on its own cannot free
itself from the Mind. It is only a Satguru, who has the power
to show its identity and free them from the clutches of
Kalpurush, the Mind. Adi Shakti as a embodiment of Maya
remains with Niranjan, the Mind as Ardhangini (one half of
body). Jointly, they never let the Hansas free. Atma attains
awareness of this ignorance on surrendering and receiving
Naam at the feet of Satguru. In all these three worlds, Alakh
Niranjan is the ruler.
Alakh Niranjan with his trinity sons; Brahma who
creates, Vishnu who sustains and Shiva who destroy, never
let Jivas free from Maya. As a Mind, as per his desires
engages all Jivas in action and he also acts as a dispenser of
fruits of action. With repeated creation and dissolution, by
creating Satyug, Tretayug, Dwaparyug and Kaliyug, and as
Mind indulges Jivas in enjoyment, action and devotion. In
the Bhakti- devotion, he remains as a goal of attainment.
Kabir Sahib has given the description of the world of Alakh
Niranjan in his words of wisdom ('Gyan Gudri')-
Alakh purush as Mind, very cleverly, bound the Atma in
the 84 lakhs of life forms. The bodies of the 84 - lakh life
forms are made with the five elements and three gunas
(Characteristics). The benefactor of boon from
Parampurush, Kalniranjan has mixed the body with Jiv
(Life), Brahm (delusion), and Maya (illusion). Taking the
Atma into the body, in the form of Surti – concentration (On
senses) as thread and Nirati-vibration (Breathin-Prana) as a
needle and with it, made a cap of intellect (Brain) and
linked to the wisdom (Gyan). In the container of body, he
has loaded with Kam (desire), Krodh (anger), Lobh (greed),
Moh (attachment), Mada (pride) and Maathsarya (envy) and
25 properties and stitched them together. Sahib said the


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **7**
Sants have to observe into the structure of body and its
arrangement very minutely. Sun and Moon are in the form
of eyes are present in the body. See with the grace of
Satguru, look into the body, discriminate be alert and do not
let it stain. Avoid slothfulness. Those who enquire on the
field of Body will only meet its creator Niranjan.
With a Heart in the form of Shoulder bag, with a
footwear of forgiveness, with a walking stick of
perseverance, with unbreakable nerve of devotion and with
Surti of rememberance, walk in and drink the nectar of
Satya Bhakti (True devotion). This way, destroying the
agressive Kal-The Mind, you will be free from Affections
and Attachments. When Satguru bestows the Alive Holy
Naam, he binds the world with a chain. The disciple being
free reaches the 11th door. Disciple becomes free from the
five elements, Attachment, Sacrifices, Detachment and
Tilak-Decoration, etc. Meeting a Satguru, Mind becomes
helpful like a flintstone and you can realise fundamental
creative fire (Mool Brahma Agni).
Sahib asks us to clean (the body) the beggar's bedding
and the stains of misjudgment with the soap of good
discrimination. Sahibji says, "With a easy posture (aasan)
and with the sound of patience, meditate on the seat of truth
(Eighth Chakra). Satguru giving the strength of patience and
the power of meditation leads the concentration from the
Nabhi-centre. Taking the body as a mansion of
righteousness and making a garland of Spiritual
discrimination (Vivek) and as an embodiment of eternal
compassion, engage in the service of Jivas. Keeping the
Mind like a caged animal, make your body like Vaishakhi
(a joyful occasion for all on harvest of crop, full moon day-
in the month of Vaishakh-February). End the power of
Mind and bring it under your compassion. Making a garland
out of breath and with the inner purity remember (in the
reversal of breath-Ajapa japa) the Naam, only he will know
the secret. In this way, it is possible to destroy the


**8 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
confusion, sorrow of delusion and the five-twenty five
elements and characteristics and become victorious.
Make your heart like mirror and then when the bad
qualities disappear, he becomes an absolute renounciate
(Viragi). When you take the breath to Shunya (the void
space with Surti), you receive the nectar of Satgurus'
Soundless Sound. Cleaning the stains of worldly pain and
pleasure, Sushmana Nadi gets cleared. In this way realizing
the mind and self and with the wisdom, one attains the
capacity to witness Niravana. Moving from the Ashtakamal
Dal (Eight petals Chakra) to the void space in meditation,
Yogis realize their self. Merging the Ida, Pingla and
entering Sushmana one reaches Triveni. Then, remaining in
the Banknal, free from the influence of Mind, reach the void
space with the grace of Satguru. Reaching the Mansarovar,
one becomes free from the Mind. Realising the true self and
with the eye of Atma, you can have the darshan of
Parampurush. This state is completely free from ego and
pride. Making the body as a field, perform pooja to the light
of Satya Naam placed on the altar. Concentrate only on the
Soundless Sound (Naam) of Satyapurush in Dhyaan and not
on any other worldly Naam. When you meditate, offer your
breath as Chandan, Tulsi and flower, empty your memory.
With observance of faith, offer the fragrance of love and be
in the remembrance of the eternal true alive Naam of
Satguru (all these describes the feeling and process which
one has to adapt in meditation as demonstrated during
Naamdan.)
It is the Atma which is wearing the rag-body and taken it
as its form. Sur (Demons), Nar (Humans) and Muni (Sages)
have become desireous of this rag. When Kabir in the form
of Satguru frees one from the play of rag. When one
remains with the holy company of Satguru, with his grace
everything can be attained. Satguru helps in the
remembrance of Satnaam, in the reversal of breath and


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **9**
illumines the body of rags. The secret lies in between the
breath-Nirati and concentration-Surti.
This is the highlight of Sahib-

Below the seven worlds of Maha-shunya (Great Void
Space), in the three worlds of space (Shuniya) and fourteen
divisions, the lord of the universe Kalpurush bound the
Jivas with deception. With the body of five elements, he has
put the souls into its 84 lakhs of life forms. Not only this, he
has immersed them in three qualities of Satva (Virtuous),
Rajo (Active- passionate) and Tamo (Dullness) gunas.
Entangled them with network of five terrible tendencies;
Kaam (desire), Krodh (anger), Lobh (greed), Moh
(attachment) and Ahankar (Ego) and its 25 attributes.
Taking control of it, Niranjan has taken seat as Mind. This
way, he has created the body. With the three worlds, he also
created the Sun, Moon, Stars, Galaxies, etc; and made this
universe attractive. The rising, expansion, setting, and the
dissolution; all these happens because of influential force of
Niranjan.
How was Parampurush before his Son Niranjan who
emerged out of Word uttered by Parampurush? Sahibji says-
In the beginning, Parampurush was unmanifest. There
was no efficient cause, reason, or motive. He was on a lotus
without form. Once in delight, he created Hansas from
himself and he was very pleased. First, Parampurush uttered
a word and it spread a brilliant light, with it he has created
many islands and merged in them. The same is refered to as
Amarlok. In that world of brilliance where Parampurush
had his seat of throne, that place had come to know as
"Puhup Dweep". In that infinite brilliant space, there were
88 thousand islands (dweeps). Just as the enterace of Atma
into body brings it alive, similarly with the entry of
Parampurush, Satlok becomes active. By this act, he has
become Satyapurush. That world of brilliance, itself is


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **11**
Satyapurush and it itself is Amarlok. In the Amarlok, every
particle will put crores of Suns into shame; such was its
brilliance, ocean of bliss.
In that brilliant light, Satyapurush manifested himself as
many just like sprinkling of handful of seawater into space,
which becomes infinite drops. However, unlike those water
drops, which fall back into the ocean to become ocean,
those infinite brilliant parts, did not return to the source
because, Satya purush willed that they should remain
separate identity. They have come to know as Hansas
(Atma-Spirits) and they were bathing in bliss.
_Satyapurush Jab Gupt Rahaye|Kaaran Karan Nahi Nirmaye||
Samput Kamal Raha Gupt Saneha|Puhup Mahi Raha Purush

Sahaj Athasi Deep Rachi Rakha|Purush Icha Teh Sab Abhilasha||
Sabe Dweep Rahu Agar Samayi|Agar Vasana Bahut Suhayi||_
The Hansas were moving in the Satlok in bliss with a
separate identity. It is a wonderful and surprising sight
because the water droplet of the ocean, does not have
separate identity with the ocean. Just like the fishes of the
ocean, those Hansas stayed in the Satlok enjoying the
eternal bliss. After this, he uttered words-Sounds and Sons
began to appear. As he uttered the words, it began to take
shape. Just as Parampurush utterred a Sound, Kurma ji was
born and bow down to the feet of Parampurush.
_Duje ShabdhJuPurushParkasa|
NikseyKurmCharanGahiAsa||_
With the third sound, the giver of Wisdom (Gyaan)
Gyaani appeared. He was given an island and he stayed
close to the feet of the Purusha.
_Tijey Shabd Bhayeju Purush Uchara|Gyaan Naam Sut Upjey Sara||
Teki Charan Sammukh Hai Raheu|AgyaPurushDweepTinha Daheu||_


**12 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
With the fourth sound, Vivek came into the existence.
He stayed with the island of Parampurush.
_Chauthe Shabd Bhaye Punhi Jabhi|Vivek Naam Sut Upjey Tabhi||
Aap Purush Kiye Dweep Nivasa|Pancham Shabd So Tej Parkasa||_
With the fifth powerful sound Niranjan comes in
existence and filled with brilliant light. He was later called
Kal Niranjan who tormant Jiv Atmas. All the Sons were
created wishfully. However, Hansas are not created of
Desire; they are spark of Parampurush himself. That is why;
Atma-Spirit has neither a beginning nor a end. It is eternal.
_Panchva Shabd Jab Purush Uchara|Kal Niranjan Bhau Autara||
Tej Ang Teh Kal Hai Ava|Tatey Jivan Key Santava||
Jivan Ansh Purush Ka Aahi|Adi Ant Kou Janat Nahi||_
Parampurush uttered sixth sound from its mouth and
Sahaj was born and has the form of supreme desire.
_Chatey ShabdPurushMukhBhasha|PragateSahaj NaamAbhilasha||_
With the seventh sound, appeared Santosh. He also lived
in the island of Parampurush. With the eighth sound
appeared Son Surti and he stayed in the dweep named
'Subhav'.
_Athaye Shabd Purush Ucchara|Surti Subhav Deep Baithara||_
With the ninth sound, appeared Anand and he has
representated Anand (Bliss). With the tenth sound, son
Kshama appeared. He represents forgiveness.
_Navmey Shabd Anand Apara|Dashaye Shabd Kshama Anusara||_
With the eleventh sound, Son Nishkam (represents
desireless action) appeared and with the twelveth sound,
Jalrangi appeares.
_Gyaarahe Shabd Naam Nishkama|
Baraha Shabd Sut Jalrangi Naama||_
With the thirteenth sound, Son Achint was born (He
represents worrylessness). With the fourteenth sound, Prem
was born.
_Teraha Shabd Achint Sut Jaano|
Chaudaha Shabd Sut Prem Bakhano||_
With the fifeteen sound, Son 'Yog Santayan' and with
the sixteenth Son Dhairya (Fearlessness) appeared.


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **13**
_Pandraha Shabd Sut Din Dayala|

This way, Parampurush has created sixteen offsprings
and linked them together with the thread of Surti. It is only
with the Sound/Words only Satpurush has created the Sons
as well as the Islands. In all those islands, Hansas are given
place and they were given Nectar. The beauty of the
offsprings are without description. Place is filled with
eternal bliss. All the offsprings are the reflections of the
brilliance of the Parampurush. As an analogy, the heir of
Satpurush has a brilliance of crores of Suns and Moons.

The Wiked Act Of Fifth Son- The Niranjan.
```
Satyalok is the spring of bliss, where there is no worry,
attachment, desire etc. there the Hansas drink the nectar of
Sathyapurush.
_Satpur Anand Dhaam|Sok Moha Dukh Taha Nahi||
Hansan Ko Bisraam|Purush Daras Achvan Sudha||_
Separating from all the blissful Hansas and 16 Sons of
words, of Satyapurush, the fifth Son Niranjan played a
mischief. Before becoming Dharmaraj for this creation, he
meditated on Parampurush for 70 Yugas, one pointedly
(Ekagrat) standing on one leg. Parampurush delighted with
the intense penance of Niranjan, he enquired as to why is he
engaged in such a difficult worship. Then Niranjan bowed
head and requested Sahib a separate space for himself.
Parampurush said "Oh Niranjan! Go take residence in
Manasarovar Dweep."
_Yahi Bahut Diwas Gayo Biti|Ta Pichey Esi Bhaee Riti||

Agya Kiye Jahu Sut Tahava|Manasarovar Deep Hai Jahava||_
Reaching Manasarovar, Niranjan felt happy. Niranjan
again he did penance for 70 Yugas standing on one leg.
Parampurush became compassionate; he has called Sahaj
and asked him to meet Niranjan to know what he wanted.
Sahaj told Niranjan- "Niranjan, Parampurush is pleased
with you, now ask what you want!" Niranjan said- "Sahaj,
you are my brother! Tell Parampurush, to give me Satyalok
itself or a new place on which I will have complete right."

After listening to Niranjan, Sahaj returned to
Parampurush and narrated everything. After hearing Sahaj
and the request, Parampurush told him- “I am giving
Niranjan a separate three worlds in Shunya and ruler-ship
for 17 Chaukadi Asankhya Yug. Oh Sahaj! Go and tell
Niranjan about this." When Sahaj told Niranjan about this
he was pleased and felt surprised.
Niranjan asked Sahaj- "Parampurush has given me the
three worlds but, how am I to create these three worlds and
develop it? How to access or make it possible? I do not
know. Be compassionate, show me the method, how can I
accomplish this; I do not know the way. Oh affectionate


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **15**
Brother! Please find out from Parampurush and tell me the
methodology and means of accomplishing this task. How
can I make nine divisions and where is the material for
this?"
Sahaj returned back to Parampurush, offered his
salutation and placed the words of Niranjan before him.
Parampurush directed Sahaj to go and tell Niranjan that all
the materials are available in the stomach of 'Kurm'; ask
him to request Kurm and receive the materials. Then Sahaj
went to Niranjan and passed on the message of
Parampurush and told him that he may go to Kurmji,
bowing before him request the material, he will hand over
the materials gracefully.

Niranjan went to Kurmaji with enthusiasm and pride and
offered no obeisance or request. He did not offer any prayer.
Kurmji is a giver of nectar like pleasure, peace and cools the
flame of 'I' (Ahankar).Niranjan filled with pride looked at
Kurmji who was double his size and was very strong. He
got angry and ran around him thoughtfully as to how he can
take the materials from Kurmji. He went closer to Kurmji,
gave stroke on his head with his nails and attacked his
stomach. He ate his three heads, air releases from his
stomach. With these three heads only, latter he created his
Sons Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, and the progeny of
Trinity. In a Subtle form Space, Air, Fire, Water and Earth
and with that Sun, Moon, Stars, etc emerged from Kurmji's
stomach. The Sky also emanated. Niranjan reached Shunya
with all these material and created 49 crores of World with
water drops. This creation however was lifeless. Niranjan
was still in the Manasarovar which was part of Amarlok.
Kurmji has placed the troubles that Niranjan has given
him, before Parampurush, and told him in dhyan that
Niranjan has forcefully torned his stomach and taken the
elements but because of your permission, I kept silent.
Parampurush replied that he is the elder brother and it is
proper that he will be tolerant on younger brother and
forgive their bad actions with love.

Kabir Sahib has said-
_Shiv Viranchi NaradMuni Gyaani|Man Ki Gati UnhuNahi Jaani||
Dhruv Pralhad Vibhishan Shesha|Tan Bhitari Man Unhu Nahi
Dekha||_
After giving up the body, Mind moves on with the Jiva
(Life force). It is the Mind, which gives birth to Jiva, the
impressions, creates Karmas and dispenses fruit of Karma.
Mind is the Chitragupt and the judge. Even Brahma, Shiv
and Brahmagyani Narad could not comprehend the working
of Mind. Shesh, Vishnu, Dhruv, Prahalad and Vibhishan;
such devotees also could not understand the secrets of
Mind. They could not locate the existence of Mind within
the body. _'Man Ki Gati Unhu Nahi Jani|'_ The secrete of the
Mind can be revealed only by Sant Satguru who live in the
experience of the world of Satpurush which is beyond this
impermanent world of futility. Nobody enquires on what
happens to the Mind after death. Everyone knows and
understands that after the death Atma takes birth again and
takes body as per its previous Karmas. Nobody enquires as
to where the Mind goes after the death of body. Even
Sanak-Sanandan and Gauri-Ganesh has failed to understand
this Mind.
Yogis and Yogeshwars did meditation in various ways,
did worship and penance in many ways, they torched their
body and reduced it to bones; even then Mind did not come
under control nor they could understand the Mind. Kabir
Sahib has said-
_Man Hi Sarupi Dev Niranjan, Tohi Raha Bharmai|_


**18 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
_Hey Hansa Tu Amarlok Ka, Pada Kaal Bas Aai||
Panch Pachees Teen Ka Pinjada, Jame Tohi Rakha Bharmai||_
Alakh Niranjan whom no one can see has bound
everyone in this universe.With the ignorance due to Mind,
all are taking the illusions of the Mind as real and entangle
themselves. This way the entire creation is deluded. Instead
of churning the curd, they are churning the water. Just like
the Chakor bird takes burning amber into his mouth
mistaking it as Moon. When it gets burning sensation in the
beak, it gives up. Again, he picks up the burning amber due
to its attachment to Moon and suffers a lot. Similarly,
people of this world have taken the formless Niranjan as
their supreme Lord. All are marching towards him and are
devoted to him. Finally, they earn endless suffering. They
are not able to overcome rebirth and they are revolving in
84 lakhs of Life forms created by Niranjan. Just like how
scientist, remotely sitting on the Earth, controls a missile or
a satellite, direct them with a remote control.

```
Manifestation of Mind
```
The Jiva and its body are under remote control. Mind
wants to operate with it. Mind is present in the body with
four aspects Thought, Memory, Intellect and Ego. All these
four deludes Atma. Water has three states- Solid, Liquid
and Gas; in essence, all the three are same. Ice contains both
Solid and Gas; but it is same water. Similarly, all the four
Thought, Memory, Intellect and Ego are Mind only. All the
desires arise from Mind. Atma does not desire anything.
Atma does not require any material. Atma does not depend
on any, it fullness itself, it is blissful then why will it seek
from outside. Atma does not desire any house or food; it is
not affected by heat or cold. It is only our Mind, which
seeks tasty foods. We are on wrong belief that Atma is
prompting us to take food. Atma does not have mouth then,
how can he eat? This is the play of Mind and senses, it is


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **19**
the Mind, which prompts every senses. Mind desires and
senses moves to fulfill it. Embodying the Atma, Niranjan
has betrayed. Atma has submitted its power and strength to
the Mind. With the repeated birth and death of the body,
Atma stayed with the Mind and forgotten its true identity.
To fulfill the selfishness of Mind, Atma cooperates with the
senses.
By inference we all know that the body is disintegrates.
Even big Mahatmas also have to give up their body after
reaching at certain point. The pitiable thing is, we always
become very fond of this body. All these are done for the
sake of pleasure and comfort of the body. For the
betterment of Atma and for freeing from Attachment to the
body, we are doing nothing. Sant says that if we do any
amount of study of Ved, Shashtras and other Scriptures of
Dharma (Religion),until the time we realize our spirit Atma,
by identifying and overcoming the Mind and Body, we
cannot function as Atma (Spirit). Without understanding the
Atma we take this body as ourselves because of the eternal
nature of Atma. Therefore, residing in the body, Atma takes
the body as permanent, eternal and the truth. In reality, body
is perishable, impermanent, and deceptive because the
formless Mind Niranjan imprisons Atma in the new bodies
after rebirth repeatedly. Therefore, Atma assumes that it is
eternal with the body.
_Sur Nar Muni Sabko Thagey, Manhi Liya Autar|
Jo Koi Yatey Bachey, Teen Lok Sey Nyaar||_
This Mind has put Human, Munijan, Gods in delusion.
Mind has taken the form Avatars and as a protector
appeared in front. Whoever understands the wickedness,
tricks and the lies of the Mind and takes to the feet of
Satguru, he will cross these three worlds and reach the
fourth lok Amarlok.
The second aspect of the Mind is Buddhi (intellect). It
discriminates and decides on how well you're like, desire,
intentions can be fulfilled. To decide, to do or not to do a


**20 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
work, to identify who is your friend and foe, whether the
work is profitable or not, whether to go to particular place
or not, what to eat and what not to eat, which occasion is
good or bad, whose support to take and whom to oppose; all
these are decided by Intellect. All these decisions of
intellect are for the body only. Intellect does not get time to
contemplate on Atma because intellect is the aspect of mind
and it has nothing to do with Atma. Intellect is a decision
point of mind only, it proceeds only for the fulfillment of
desire, intention made by the Mind. Only in the company of
Atmagyanis, it contemplates on Atma for little time. This
happens only when we listen to the Sants whose words
touches our inner self and we enter into enquiry. Enquiry is
the characteristics of Atma but within short time, Mind
takes us to its realm. Giving up the Atmic enquiry, we are
entangled in the world of Mind.
_Jiv Satavey Kaal, Nana Karm Lagai Key|
Aap Chalavey Chal, Kashta Dei Puni Jiv Key||_
Kaal-Mind deceptively engages Jivas in action and he
himself gives the trouble.
The third aspect of Mind is Chitt (Memory). The work
of memory is remembrance, recollection. This is the place
of storage for Mind. After the resolution of the Mind,
memory will help in identifying resources. Where to get
which eatable, identify mode of transportation to reach
places, from where to get material for construction of house,
etc. all these will be done with Chitt. Chitt will only lead in
fulfilling the desires of Mind. This also will not be helpful
to Atma and will not give the recollection of Satyapurush.
When we think about a place, an incident, a discussion
immediately Chitt brings to our view, those places,
incidents, and discussions. Sometime it can give the
recollection of an event, which are fifty or sixty years old
but it will not help in the recollection of Atma or
Satyapurush. Chitt will bring that into recollection, which is
relevant to Mind alone. It has no connection with Atma. We


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **21**
Jivas are under some entanglement. It is a very critical
issue, ponder over it.
_Deh Dhari Nar Parghat Hovey, Firitahi Asha Kinehu|
Bharmat Ith Uth Kaal Bas, Bahut Punya Mey Chit Dinheu||_
Even after taking Human birth, Jivas in reliance of
Kaalpurush, tossed up and down in seeking meritorious
deeds as indicated by Chitt. They are in the grip of Kaal
always struggling.
The fourth aspect of Mind is Ahankaar-Ego. It does the
work, which is resolved. On identification by Chitt has to at
which place, with what medium the work can be done;
Ahankaar performs such a job. For example, a thought of
eating a Mango arouse. Buddhi -Intellect decides about the
Money. If Money is not there, it indicates to the Mind that
Mango cannot be obtained. If the money is available then it
indicates that Mango can be purchased and eaten. Now,
Chitt will tell where the Mango is available. Previously,
when we took a stroll in the Market, we have seen a Mango
stall. The location detail is retained in the Chitt-Memory
and the same is retrieved. Then we go to the Market to buy
the Mango and buy the Mango. This is called Ego of Mind.
If all the desires are fulfilled, then understand that Mind
has gone to Sleep. When there is no discrimination and no
resolution or doubt, understand the work of the Intellect-
Buddhi has come to an end and it has gone to sleep. When
there is no recollection, understand that Chitt also has gone
to sleep. When there is no effort to do any work, there is no
movement of Hands, and Legs, understand that Ego has also
gone to sleep. When all the four goes to sleep, know that
you have achieved Atmic Realisation. When you leave
Thought, Intellect, Memory and Ego what remains is Atma.
Atma experiences itself, there is no witness for it. Free from
the Mind, Atma becomes self-evident. When Atma is free
from the Mind then Atma becomes the doer. Sahib says:
_Man Gorakh Man Govinda, Man Hi Aughad Hoi|
Jo Man Rakhey Jatankari, Toh Aapey Karta Hoi||_

## 2. Play Of Mind On (8 Petaled) Heart Chakra

Inside everyone, there is a network of Kalpurush.
Thoughts are not yours. In everyone, Mind has eight bands-
Ashta Kamaldal (8-pettaled lotus of seat). There are 8
divisions in the heart. Mind stays in the center. Once a girl
came to me and said that she is very much depressed. I am
unable to identify the cause. Nothing serious had happened
to me yet I am depressed. She said, she cannot find the
reason and did not feel like talking to anyone. I told her that
there is a reason for this condition. There are 8 divisions in
the heart chakra. In the center stays the Mind.
_Uttar Dal Par Jab Mann Jaai|Daya Dharm Tab Urr Mey Aai||_
As long as it is in the Northern petal, it will manifest
devotional feelings. It will arise automatically. It only
means thought and expression of feelings does not
belong to the individual (Atma). Very powerful forces
are operating from within us. You will remain in that
state. Why did the thought arise? Man is unable to
comprehend this.
_Dakshin Dal Par Jab Mann Jata|Mahalobh Tab Urr Mey Ata||_
When the Mind takes its seat on the southern side
petal, Anger will arise; without a valid reason anger
will be generated on any issue. The attitude will be very
forceful; you will like to fight. Good or bad feelings are
not of Atma. All these are play of Mind. You will

quarrel with anyone. You will loose your firmness. You
will get extremely angry that time.
Some people may say that they are not in mood and
not to have discussion. What is this mood? This is the
state of Mind.
_Pashchim Dal Par Jab Mann Jai|Vishai Vasana Urr Mey Aai||_


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **23**

When the Mind sits on the western petal, thought
will arise on pleasure of sex, will bring out unnecessary
and perverted topics. You will contemplate on this. You
will be unaware of the reason for the thought to arise.

This is also the play of Mind. Even Masters of Wisdom
could not recognise this.
_Purva Dal Par Jab Mann Jai|Hassi Bhaav Tab Urr Mey Aai||_
When the Mind takes seat on the eastern petal, there
will be the urge to Laugh. Even on simple issues, you
will begin to laugh. You will begin to laugh at all kinds
of issues. You will only feel like laughing. You will be
in a mood to laugh. Even if you see somebody walks,
you will feel like laughing at that person. Sometime you
ask such a person- what is the matter? Why do you

laugh? He wont know himself why he was laughing. It
is because Mind is seated in the eastern direction.
Therefore, you may have to laugh and laugh. Your
behavior will be influenced to keep laughing.
There are eight directions- East, West, North, South,
North-West (Vayu), South-East (Agni), South-West
(Naitrit) and North-East (Ishaan).
_Vayu Dal Par Jab Mann Jai|Lobh Bhav Tab Urr Mey Aai||_
Greed and ambition will keep rising if Mind is in the
North-Western direction. As long as Mind remains
there, it will give rise to thought and plan of earning
wealth- money. The thought will keep on prompting.
Why did this thought arised in you? You do not know.
Its because the Mind is seated in that direction

(Koshtak). This thought will keep on appearing as long
as Mind is seated there. This means it indicates that you
have no control over the arising of thoughts. Whatever
the Mind wishes, it will take you towards it. Therefore-
_Man Tarang Mey Jagat Bhulana||_


**24 |** S a hi b B a n d g i

Every individual in this world driven into action this
way they flow with the promptings of Mind. It is not
the nature of Atma. This is the nature of Mind. Why is
it doing like this? Let us see further.
_Agni Dal Par Jab Mann Jaai|Irshya Bhaav Urr Mey Aai||_
The sixth direction is South- East (Agni). When the

Mind is on this petal, it will give rise to Hatred,
Irritation and Opposition. One- and a half to two hours,
these feelings will keep rising. Sometime you get
aversion against such feelings like Hatred and irritation.
One will get such a thought on and on but he doesn't
know the force behind it. He has too hate because Mind
is seated on the Agni koshtak.
_Ishaan Dal Par Jab Mann Jai|Ahankar Tab Urr Mey Aai||_
When the Mind takes the seat on the North- East
(Ishaan), it gives rise to Ahankar (Ego), Pride. You will
be so proud that other people do not matter to you.
_Naitrit Dal Par Jab Mann Jai|Udaasinta Tab Urr Mey Aai||_
When Mind is seated on the South-West petal, it
will give rise to sadness. You wont feel like talking to
anyone. No talk will interest you. You will wish that no

one should speak to you. You will go into deeper and
deeper depression.
_Ashtadal Kamal Par Man Dhaye, Nana Naach Nachaye||_
Sahib says- This Mind is making everyone dance.
_Jo Koi Kahey Mey Man Ko Dekha, Iski Roop Na Rekha||
Palak Palak Mey Vo Dhiklaye, Jo Sapney Nahi Dekha||
Santo Man Ka Karo Viveka||_
When Mind is on Naitrit dal, you will sit down quietly
with sadness. I told that girl that this time your Mind is
seated on the Naitrit dal, therefore you are depressed.you
will feel only sadness. No one is able to understand all these
plays of Mind. Therefore, Sahibji says-
_Ashtadal Kamal Par Mann Dhaye|Nana Nach Nachaaye||_
Why Mind is doing this?


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **25**
_Man Ko Koi Dekh Na Paye|Nana Nach Nachaaye||_
No one is able to perceive the Mind. It plays games with
your life.
_Isko Pakad Sakey Koi Santa|Pakad Gahey Isko Magvanta||_
A Mahapurush can understand this. This means there is
a huge network operating through the heart. Just like the
system in the mobile phones and its settings. This way,
Mind has Eight Koshtaks. It creates eight different
temperaments from the heart. Why it does so? Because it
want you to remain entangled in this and your focus
concentration on Dhyaan should remain engaged in this so
that you will not feel inclined towards the realization of
eternal Atma tattva. This is the biggest deception of Mind.
This means your fundamental nature are not allowed to
manifest. Therefore, not all the temperaments, which Mind
prompts, are of Atma. The power of Atma is engaged in the
activities of Mind. What all the way Mind wants, Atma is
sustaining it. Therefore, Kabir Sahib says-
_Man Hasey ManRovey, ManJagey ManSovey, ManDeveyMan Levey|
Man Khaye Man Piye, Man Gaye Man Nachey|
Kahat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Jagat Bana Hai Man Sey||_
Why is the Mind doing this? It is because it wants that
you should not experience the Atma. Therefore, Mind keeps
prompting those tendencies. It makes you dance and dance.
That is why; it cannot be controlled with any Sadhna, Yoga,
Meditation, reading and renumerating holy books. Mind is
very strong.
_Man Tarang Mey Jagat Bhulana||_
The whole world is forgetfully engaged in the activities
(Karmas) of the Mind.
_Man Par Jo Sawar Hai, Aisa Birla Koi||_
Mind can be controlled only by rare being (Satguru).
That is why the world is unable to comprehend the network
of Mind- The 8 Bands (Koshtaks). It creates 8 different
temperaments. Sometimes you laugh, sometimes you get
anger, sometimes you are playful, sad, worried, desparate,


**26 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
greedy, sometimes the sexual feeling arises in you,
sometime you feel insane, sometime you show hatred,
sometime you feel dejected.
_Man Hi Levey, Man Hi Devey, Man Hi Jagey Man Hi Sovey|
Man Ka Hai Yaha Sakal Pasara, Man Sey Koi Nahi Nyaara||_
Therefore,
_Man Tarang Mey Jagat Bhulana||_
No one can control his mind with his own effort under
any circumstance. It is keeping Atma in its grip. In this
state, individuality, Mind and Maya you are trapped. It is
very difficult.
_Tera Bairi Koi Nahi, Tera Bairi Mann||_
Sahib says-
_Jiv Ke Sang Man Kal Ko Vasa|
Agyaani Nar Gahey Vishwaasa||_
Mind is your enemy. No one has the strength to
overcome its grip and free from its network. It has a strong
hold on Atma. All the sages from the time immemorial
Rishi, Muni, Peer-Paigambar,etc were made to dance.
_Man Hi Niranjan Sabhey Nachaaye||_
Then is it possible to free oneself from Mind (Niranjan)!
Not at all, never with one's own effort.
_Man Ko Koi Dekh Na Paye||_
Mind is never visible and cannot be understood. This
way it makes everyone dance to its dictates.
_Nana Nach Nachaaye||_
Sometime, you do such an act only to repent it later.
You start wondering why and how you did such a thing.
Later you feel that you should not have done that. Why is it
so? You have done it and you regret. What are all these?
Sahibji warns-
_Dil Ka Hujara Saaf Kar, Jana Ke Aaney Ke Liye|
Dhyaan Auro Ka Utha, Usko Bithaney K Liye||
Ek Dil Lakho Tammana, Uspey Bhi Jyaada Havas|
Fir Thikana Hai Kaha, Usko Bithaney Ke Liye||

T h e Forml e s s M i n d **27**
Mind has a profound effect and is impossible to root out.
It is very harmful and dangerous enemy. Vasudev Krishna
told Arjuna that it is not enough if you follow only Satya
and Dharma; for the realisation of Atma concentrate on
Trikuti with one- pointedness. Arjuna said- "Hey Janardan!
It is difficult to churn the ocean, verily impossible still I will
try but it is not possible to control the Mind. It does not
come under control. To break the akash and the void space
is impossible still I will try but do not ask me to control the
Mind. I cannot succeed it under any condition. To tie a knot
with the air is impossible; I will try but do not ask me to
control Mind. It is not possible under any circumstance. I
have done many sadhnas and performed many purificatory
actions, etc. but I could not succeed.sahib says-
_Manat Nahi Man Mora Sadho, Manat Nahi Man Mora||_
Mind (Kal Niranjan) gets the work done as per its
design. It is a veil on Atma. Atma is unable to do anything
with its own nature.
This way, Kal is like a Falcon, and Jiva is like a
Partridge. There is none whom he has not hurt. It will not
come under the control of any Sadhana-Yog.

_Jus nut markat ko dukh deyi. nana nach nachavan leyi._
Our Mind is causing trouble to the jivas in a manner a juggler
does to the monkey.
_Munn hi saroopi dev niranjan, tohi raha bharmayi.
Hei hansa tu Amar lok ka, pada kal bus ayi._
O Jeevatma! This Mind itself is Niranjan who has been
misleading you since ages together. You are the Jiva of Amarlok
but you have fallen in the grip of Kal Niranjan.

## 3. The Strength of Mind

To rule over the Jivas, Mind takes the form of four
aspects and arranged five infallible weapons so that Atma
will ever remain under its grip. Kama (desire), Krodha
(anger), Lobha (greed), Moha (attachment) and Mada
(pride); these are the five weapons of the Mind. These
weapons have their own family networks, they never let the
Mind rest. They hold Atma under the grip to draw their
sustenance or support. Jivatma is bound by Mind in various
ways. Sahib says-
_Bahu Bandhan Se Bandhiya, Ek Bichaara Jiv|
Jiv Bichaara Kya Karey, Jo Na Chudavey Peev||_
The mind itself is under the grip of Kama, Krodha,
Lobha, Moha, Ahankar. 'Kama' rides on Mind, 'Krodha' also
rises in Mind, 'Lobh' is the work of Mind. 'Moha' is also by
Mind. Ego and Pride are stains of Mind. Kabir sahib has
spoken about their strength-
_Man Pancho Key Vash Pada, Man Ke Vash Nahi Panch|
Jit Dekhu Tit Dou Lagi, Jit Bhagu Tit Aanch||
Bura Jo Dekhan Mai Chala, Bura Na Miliya Koy||
Jo Dil Khoja Aapna, Mujsey Bura Na Koy||_
It is because of this association, the desire of Mind can
never be fulfilled. Because of association of this wicked
qualities, the Mind of every being are in the influence of
bad things.Nobody is paying attention towards these wicked
influences. If all the desires of the Mind are satisfied then
you will find no worries in the world. Niranjan, who is mind
itself, is in worry after creating these Worlds.
'Desire to have a Sex(Kaam)’ is the Head of Mind. For
fulfillment of Lewdness- sexual desire-sensual satisfaction;
Maaran, Maran, Mohan(charm), Vashikaran (bewitchment),
seperation (Ucchatan) these are the strength of Kaam. Sahib
says-
_Yaha Kaam Ati Prachand Hai, Hoy Utpanna Tiya Ang|
Sain-Chain Atihi Badhey, Chade Kaam Rati Rang||_


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **29**
_Tan Man Asthir Na Rahey, Kaam Baan Urr Saal|
Ek Baan Sey Sab Kiye, Sur Nar Muni Behaal||_
When the desire arises in the Mind, discrimination, and
wisdom departs. The army of Kaam- Desire is big. By the
attraction of Kama, Yogeshwar Shivji enamored by the
Mohini form of Vishnu, Shivji engaged in sensual pleasure
with Mohini. Stuck by the Desire of Lust, Indradev
fraudulently went to the Gautam Rishi's wife Ahaliya and
deceptively engaged in sensual pleasure. The power of
Niranjan's Mind, Kaam-Lust did not leave even the men of
strength like Shringi Rishi, Narad Muni and Ravan etc.
Kaam has terrified consumed even Gyaanis-Men of wisdom
and Dhyaanis- Men of penance. Kama-Lust has a family: Its
Wife is Rati, Greed is his Son, and Voracity is the Kinsmen.
The family of Kaam is very bad; they all commit only bad
actions. When Man is afflicted with these influences of
Mind, he remains in forgetfulness. When agitated by lust, he
engages in characterless action. Kaam with its attraction
moved everyone far away from their Atma. This Kaam is
the cause of taking repeated birth in sinful destructive body.
Therefore, Sahib says-
_Kaami Kabhu Na Guru Bhajey, Mitey Na Sanshay Sool|
Aur Gunan Sab Baksiho, Kaami Daar Na Mool||_
Those who indulge in lustful impressions and activities
cannot sing the Glory of Guru nor do their doubts get clear.
For a lustful person, there is neither a root nor a branch.
Like Amarbel (A parasitic plant which grows on tree trunk),
therefore Satguru will not grant Mukti for such persons.
This Kaam is that power of Mind, which not only men,
but even defeated Rishis, Munis, Devtas and Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesh and compel them to remain in this Worldly
ocean of life (Bhavsagar). For the same reason, Brahma,
Vishnu, Mahesh- the creator and supporter could not escape
from the grip of Kalpurush and not eligible to attain Satlok.
_Bhakti Bigaari Kamiya, Indri Kere Swaad|
Heera Khoya Hath Sey, Janam Gavaya Baad||_


**30 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
Those who get the Vivek (Naam) from the Satguru, only
they can escape from the Kama. The Sakhi says-
_Prem priti so bandhiya, kahey kabir samjaai|
Ta prem muh vivek binu, rahe jiv murjaai||
Sur nar muni sab jitiya, koi na ubarey dham|
Maha moh shir naikey, kiyo upayan kaam||_
'Krodh'-Anger is the arm of Mind. It is mightier than
Kaam. Foolishness is the Intellect of Anger. It manifests in
many forms. It assaults with Violence and Anarchy. Even
the nine parts of the world, shivers because of it. Shiva
destroys in a rage of anger and brings dissolution. In anger,
people forget the consequences. If the anger does not harm
anybody, it definately harms himself. When in anger, Mind
does not take the help of Intellect and the awareness. With
only the physical power, all the destructive action takes
place. When anger comes, body trembles. Eyebrow curves
and meets the eye and an unpleasant word comes out of
mouth. Every hair of the body burns like fire. Mind
contemplates to hit or murder. This does not spare anyone
Mother, Father, Brother, Sister.
Brahma infuriated cursed his six sons. When Sankadis
were stopped at the gate of Vaikuntha, in anger, they cursed
Jay, Vijay to take birth as Asuras (Demons). For three
lifetimes, he has through Hiranyakashyap, Ravan and
Shishupal. Ramji killed Tadka in anger. The power of
penance of Durvasa suffered due to his Anger. Anger is the
cause of Death of fifty- six crore Yadavas, Pandavas and
Kauravas (In Dwapar Yuga). The weapon of Bhagwan in
the form of Mind is Anger only.
In the family of hatred (Krodh), violent action (Hinsa) is
the Wife, Son is the ignorance (Avichar) and Mistake is the
Kingsman. The force of the Mind does not let Atma
discriminate properly. When hatred appears in man, a veil
blocks his brain. He does not show any consideration for
others and it becomes a foolish action. Man accuses, gets
into altercation and physical fight, he distorts his self and


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **31**
later repents. In the history of world, hatred has brought
great destruction. Sahib says-
_Daso Disha Sey Krodh Ki, Uthi Aparbal Aaag|
Shital Sangat Saadh Ki, Taha Ubariye Bhag||
Kahey Kabir Vicharikey, Krodh Agni Bahu Jaag|
Sangati Sadhu Satyanaam Ki, Sharan Ubriye Bhag||_
In all the ten directions, the power of hatred propagates.
It can be subdued only in the company and Satsang of a
Sadhu. Man can escape from the fire of hatred, only with
the Adhyatmic wisdom of Atma and Paramatma. With the
nature of benevolence and welfare of all, we can overcome
Violence and ignorance. Because of this anger, Atma is
unable to overcome the bondage. Atma is in bewilderment
to reach its purity and simplicity. Mind with its power of
hatred, engages men in sinful deeds and keeps them in the
bondage of body repeatedly.
Greed (Lobh) is the heart of Mind. This is mightier than
Kaam and Krodh. Just as stopping of heart beat results in
death of the Body, similarly Atma's victory depends on
ending Mind by subduing Greed. Mind never lets the Jiva
free from Greed. To keep Atma under bondage in the
Sansar, Greed is the invincible weapon of Mind.
_Bura Lobh Teh Aur Na Koi, Sakal Adharm Lobh Teh Hoi||_
Sahib has said that there is nothing more dangerous than
Lobh. More unrighteousness takes place through Greed.
The influence of Greed brings delusion in the Mind and
engages in all the direction on attainable and unattainable
things. Greed afflicts intelligence and does not fear even
time and death. This Mind engages men in Greed and does
not let them to sleep or awake. From ten to twenty, twenty
to fifty, fifty to hundred, hundred to thousand, thousand to
lakh and crore. Not only crores in the Sansar, this greed
takes to the nine regions of the world (Nav Khand). Four
Vedas, Yantra-Mantra, Tapasya with standing on head
position and the story of eighteen purans, all these can be
accomplished by Lobh. Kabir Sahib has told Dharmadas


**32 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
that in kaliyug sinful deeds will increase. People will suffer
due to sinful deeds. The Greed of sensual enjoyments will
increase the desire for wealth. Thirst is the female partner of
Greed. Ardhangini (the other physical half) for Greed.
_Bhesh Bhakt Mudit Sabey, Gyaani Guni Apaar|
Shat Darshan Phikey Parey, Ek Lobh Key Laar||
Bhagat Mudiya Jatadhari, Gyani Guni Apaar|
Shat Darshan Bhatkat Phirey, Ek Lobh Ki Laar||

Kahe Kabir Vicharikey, Gunn Sheel Sab Jaayi||
Jaha Lobh Gunn Awagun Hey, Taha Nahi Sheel Swabhav|
Lobh Awagun Te Vachano, Guru Binn Kahe Ko Daav||_
In the family of Lobh, thirst is Wife, sin is the Son, and
falsehood is the daughter-in-law. Greed is the father of sin
because the sins are committed out of Greed.
The man of desire can become free of it, man of anger
also can change by effort but on the Greed of man even
Kabir Sahib's philosophy is limited.
_Kaami Nar Bahutey Tarey, Krodhi Tarey Aanant|
Lobhi Banda Na Tarey, Kahe Kabir Siddhaant||_
Says that- It is the effects of reverse wisdom, like a deep
dark pit (empty head) that never fills. Meaning Greed never
lets up, it is endless.
_Kabir Aondhi Khopri, Kabhu Dhapey Naahi|
Tin Lok Ki Sampada, Kab Aavey Ghar Maahi||_
Just like, the Niranjan's feet is endless in the seven Patal
(lower worlds) and head is limitless in the seven skies, he
pervades all these as Mind. Similarly, Lobh is merged in
every Jivas along with the Mind. Even if he gets the wealth
of three worlds, the Greed will not end. They will always
long for more. He can free Atma from the Sin, only when he
realizes that fulfillment is not there in taking. It is possible
only in giving and sacrifice.
_Jo Dhan Prabhu Key Heth Nahi, Paramarth Nahi Jaay|
Chor Labaar Leth Hey, Dhar Siney Par Paay||_
The thirst to seek, attain and accumulate is Greed; mind
is never fulfilled with this. With effort and proper


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **33**
equipment, if man fulfill the needs, he will not go hungry
and those Sant, Sadhu and others who visit his home will
not go hungry. To ensure that money and properties which
is earned by self effort does not constitute greed.
_Sai Itna Dijiye, Jamey Kutumb Samai|
Mey Bhi Bhuka Na Rahu, Sadhu Na Bhuka Jaai||_
'Moha'-Attachments is the capital of Mind. Laziness is
the palace of Moha. The fourth infallible weapon of Mind is
Moha, that which binds the Jiva with World, Father-Mother,
Wife-Children, Brother-Sister, Friends-Relatives, in
relationship. Jiva can forget Parampurush but in relations,
on whom his love is directed, for him, he is ever ready to
sacrifice his life even.
In the family of Moha, 'Longing and Ambition' is the
Wife, 'Desire' is the Daughter, 'Greed' is the Son, 'Hypocrit'
is the Minister, 'Deceit' is the Deputy Minister, 'Affliction
and Passion' is the Friend. This way, the family of Mind is
very big. Mind holds the Jivas with the grip of Moha,
Atma's cognition has moved very far from its recollection.
Man's desire and passion is not to be away from son,
daughter, wife, brother, mother, father. Just as how a wife
does not want to keep away from her husband, so does
'Longing' from Moha. Every Man desires to keep his family
in comfort. Just like the Daughter who wishes for the
pleasure of her Mother, Father and Brother; for the pleasure
of the Family, man is tempted to do all kinds of work.
Therefore, Son of Moha is 'Greed'-Lalach. On which one
developes attachment, for its benefit he is willing to take to
any advice, Tantra-Mantra, Ojha- Janiya and he does not
step back from these Hypocrites. For the fulfillment of
Moha, the Minister of Mind (Advisor)-'Deceit' is encourage
to betray and cheat anybody. Therefore, the friend of Moha

- 'Affliction and Passion' because with attachment man does
everything that are supposed to be avoided, therefore man
experiences Sadness, regret, affliction, punishment and
reaping the consequences of Sin. Moha is therefore an


**34 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
opponent and an enemy. Worry and indignant are its pride.
The flag of unrighteousness moves in the front of Moha and
accompanied with Music of quarrelsomeness. The army of
Moha pervades all the nine regions of the world.
This play of Mind has no connection with Atma because
Atma has no relations and friends. Since Atma has
connection with Parampurush, therefore it is an eternal
succulence. Just because of the attachment, Jiva is engaged
in sinful deeds and Atma assumes body and undergoes the
punishment of birth and death. Moha is competent to
distract a Jiva from righteous path. This is the reason why it
gets biased. Kabir sahib says-
_Jab Ghat Moh Samaaeeya, Sabey Bhaya Andhiyaar|
Nirmoh Gyaan Vichaari Key, Koi Sadhu Utarey Paar||_
When the attachment for particular thing enters the heart
of a Jiva, remaining whole world becomes loveless and
enveloped in darkness for him. Sadhu who is free from
attachment only he can save himself. Those who bestowed
with the wisdom of Satguru can only escape from it.
It is due to the attachment and anger, Parvati gave up her
life in the Yagya peeth of her father- Prajapati as a revenge
against the insult which he caused to her husband-Shiva.
Prajapati did not invite Shiva in the Yagya. By the
insistence of Parvati and as the mark of respect to the In-
Laws, Shivji had gone there. Since Shivji has come without
invitation, Prajapati has insulted him. Then because of the
attachment and anger, Shivji took burnt body of Parvati and
moved to destroy the worlds. Parvati's body parts fell at 52
different places, which are all called Shaktipeets. This way,
attachment and anger are the dangerous powers of Mind.
They are impediment to the liberation of Atma. This Moha
lives in the country of Ignorance. Just like fish lives in the
water, Moha lives in the ignorance created by Mind. In the
world, caught in the web of attachment and ignorance,
people are forgetful of their identity.
_Yaha Sena Sab Moh Ki, Kahe Kabir Samjaay|_


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **35**
_Intey Jo Koi Bachai, Bhavsagar Tarri Jaay||_
Kaam, Krodh, Lobh and Ahankar joining with the Moha
they become more effective.
Ego-Ahankar is a utmost weapon of the Mind. Sahib has
narrated the way of which Mind entangles Atma in man-
Seated in the Brain, Pride and the 'I' identification (Ego)
creates perversion. Beholding his feet, man moves
crookedly. 'Aentt (crookedness) and Akaad (pride)' are the
evidence of self-pride, it will not bow down in humility in
front of anyone. He expresses it with twisting his mustache
and by keeping his hand on others shoulder. Its intoxication
is evident from the Mind. Taking against of others and on
difference in morality, he never accepts equality. With
pride, he proclaims that he is from a very reputed family.
With pride, he boasts about his house. The one with the
pride becomes an expert in untruth and crookedness, he
roams around displaying his ego, 'I'. They don't talk straight
to anyone. They display their Wealth, Lineage, Education,
Knowledge, Beauty and Strength to all. A Yogi who
attaining Siddhis (Miraculous power), because of pride he
forgets that Kalpurush eats up even Maha Siddhas and
Yogeshwars. The entire creation is a delusion, which
Kalpurush has created to keep the Jivas under bondage.
_Kanchan Tajana Sahaj Hey, Sahaj Triya Ka Neh|
Maan Badai Irsha, Durlabh Tajani Yaha||_
This Mind is very wretched and polluted; it takes
pleasure in dirty works. It willingly sacrifices the beneficial
path, which bears the nectar like fruit of Atmic realisation.
It lovingly engages in the activities, which are antispirit
(Anatmic), which heals bitter fruit of poison. Bind the Mind
with the inner sense and destroy. Whenever it runs to a
wrong place or develops wrong desire, tie it down with
Naam of Guru.
_Yaha Man Nicha Mool Hey, Nicha Karma Suhay|
Amrut Chadey Maan Kari, Vish Hi Preeti Khaay||_


```
36 | S a hi b B a n d g i
Man can never escape from ego. In the family of
Ahankar, Wife is taunt, force is the Son and intellect is the
daughter. Therefore, the five types of egos keep man far
from Atmic wisdom, during his entire life. (1) Pride of
Wealth (2) Pride of Beauty (3) Pride of Strength (4) Pride of
Knowledge and (5) Pride of Status (caste, class and creed).
Even with any one of these, man does not accept others as
equal. Because of these powers of Mind, man takes himself
as a body, and it stays up to the level of individuality.
Keeping away from Atmic Wisdom, engaged in action and
in bondage of action and its fruit, he remains trapped. Mind
succeeds over Atma with ego.
Niranjan is named as Kalpurush, for deceiving
Satyapurush, Creating three worlds in Shunya (Void space)
and for creating the world of life forms. While narrating
this, Sahibji said to his disciple Dharmadas in the form of
Thought, Intellect, and Memory and with the strength of
Desire, Anger, Greed, Attachment, Ego, Niranjan pervades
Jivas. This Niranjan did Tapas for 64 Yugas in Manasarovar
of Amarlok and obtained Hans Atmas.
```
```
Niranjan's name became Kalpurush!
```
Niranjan created three worlds, he made Heaven (Swarg),
Earth (Mortal World), and Narak (Patal) but then he thought
of how to expand it, because he did not have the seed so, he
did not create bodies. Therefore, in that insentient worlds
there were no living entities like Amarlok where Hansas
were present. Niranjan thinking on these did Tapas standing
on one leg in Manasarovar for 64 Yugas for the interest on
three worlds.

Pleased with the hard penance of Niranjan,
compassionate Parampurush called Sahaj again and told
him- "Oh Sahaj, go and see what Niranjan wants now and
give him. Ask him to give up wickedness and follow the
instruction in reality". With the command of Parampurush,
he has reached Niranjan and said- "Oh Niranjan!
Parampurush has given you the ruler ship of three worlds.
You have taken all that which emerged from Kurmji's
stomach. Whatever you have asked, Parampurush has given
you; you have created your own kingdom. Now why are
you doing this penance?

Niranjan has placed his request before Sahaj and said I
am a servant who has nobody else to ask. Please request
Parampurush from my side that the one, who meditates on
him and serves him, should know me. Further, I want the
gift of field and seeds, otherwise how am I to create. Sahaj
took Niranjan's request to Parampurush. Parampurush
willed and created a eight armed lady, Adyashakti. She
stood on the left side and bowing her head she asked for the
instruction.

Parampurush has said- "Oh Daughter, the things which I
give you, take it carefully to Niranjan and with him do the
creation. Then Parampurush gave infinite number of
Hansas-Seed form of Atma and told her to go to Niranjan
who is in Manasarovar and with him create true creation.
There the name of the Jivas would be Sohang and there will
be no other Sohang Jivas. Sohang is the name of Jivatma
who are the park of Parampurush. Pleased with the penance
of Niranjan, Satpurush has created most beautiful woman.he
sent the Atmas with her, for creation in the Manasarovar
(ocean of pleasure). She was permitted to do true creation
(similar to Satlok) and not to put them in 84 lakhs of gross
life form. Adyashakti offered her salutation to Parampurush
and moved to Manasarovar.
Niranjan was standing in penance therefore
Parampurush called Sahaj and told him to go and tell
Niranjan that the thing, which he had asked, is being sent to
him. The basic seed has reached you. Now you can go to
Mansarovar, create as you wish.

After receiving the message, Sahaj went to Niranjan,
gave him the message of Parampurush then Niranjan
reached Mansarovar and sat. When he saw Adishakti
coming towards him, he was very pleased. The first lady-
with vast splendor, fullness of beauty. Niranjan, looking at

her every part was delighted and developed lust. With one
hand, he caught her head, in other hand her leg, and
swallowed her. Just when he swallowed her, she prayed to
Parampurush and said that Niranjan had eaten her. Then
Niranjan has chased away Sahaj from there because by then
Niranjan has attained lot of Powers.

Listening to the prayer of Adishakti, Param Purush has
remembered that he has earlier cut open Kurmaji's stomach
and removed the five elements and he has eaten off his three
heads. Now, he has swallowed Adishakti. Param Purush felt
bad. He cursed Niranjan that even if you swallow one lakh
Jivas a day, your stomach will not be appeased and will
produce 1.25 lakhs Jivas every day. Param Purush thought
of finishing Niranjan because he can be troublesome. Then
he remembered that he has given him a 17 chaukdi
asankhya Yug (10^27 Yug) ruler ship. If I finish him, it will
be violation of My word then again I have connected all the
16 sons together with a Single thread. If I remove one, all
will be finished. Therefore, Param Purush cursed him that
he will never return to his world Amarlok and Niranjan will
never get his Darshan. After this curse, Niranjan's name has
become Kal Niranjan, Kal Purush.

After Kal Niranjan was cursed from Amarlok, Param
Purush produced Yogjit from himself (Kabir Sahib). Param
Purush has taken out Gyaani (Kabir Sahib), by churning
himself and directed him to remove Niranjan from
Manasarovar. Now, he will never enter my world. Adishakti
is in his stomach, ask her to meditate on me and come out
by cutting his Stomach. By this, he will reap the punishment
for cutting the Kurm's stomach. Tell Kal Niranjan that she
will belong to him and ask him to go and stay in his three
worlds of heaven, mortal world and hell.

Taking the order from Param Purush, Yogjit reached
Mansarovar. When Niranjan saw Yogjit, He became angry
and ferociously asked him-'Who are you? Why did you
come here? Yogjit has said- "You have swallowed
Adishakti. By the order of Param Purush, I have come here
to remove you". With Dhyaan, Yogjit told Adishakti- "Why
are you sitting in his stomach, with surti on Param Purush,
cut open his stomach and come out".

Yogjit meditated on Param Purush and welding his power
of majesty and brilliance in his heart. At the very instant,
Param Purush had prompted him to hit the formidable Kal
Purush with Surti. Jogjit did so and Kal Niranjan fell
unconscious. Then Jogjit held him by his shoulder and

won’t be able to return back. She became more fearful from

the nature of the women's intellect is low. They are intent on
acts of Rati Vidhi (sexuality). Listening to sweet words of

By his action, the bleeding started. This was the significant
start. This secrete plan of earliest creation was not known to
anybody. Kal Niranjan was made physical relation with Adi
shakti for three times.Taking the five elements from
Kurmaji's stomach, he also ate his three heads. Therefore,
by union with the Adi Shakti, he has created his three sons
Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh. From those three heads
Rajogun-Brahmaji, Satwagun-Vishnuji and Tamogun-Shivji
were created. This way, with the five elements and three
Gunas, Kal Niranjan has created the worlds and the Jivas.
(Adi Shakti) the Kanya and Kal Niranjan, they have enjoyed
the stay.

First with the Rajoguna, five elements were mixed and
Brahmaji was born. When Satwagun was mixed with five
elements, Vishnuji was born and by mixing the Tamogun
with five elements, Shivji was born. With the five elements
and three Gunas, Three bodies were created. This way, Kal
Niranjan has created all the three with his own part..

Great desolation (Pralay) takes place repeatedly due to
these three Gunas and five elements. Kabir Sahibji told his
disciple Dharmadas that nobody knew this secret. After
these, Kal Niranjan has told Adi shakti- "Oh kamini! Listen
to me with attention, what I say that imbibe in you. The
Jivas and the seeds are with you, I hand over my three sons
also to you. With their help, procreate this world. You rule
these three worlds with your three sons and I will become
formless and merge in void space, as Mind I will remain in
all Jivas." Kal Niranjan told Adi Shakti that not to reveal the
secret of him to anyone. Even my three sons cannot see me,
even if they take many lives in search of me. My secrete
will not be known to anybody. I will start such relegions
and Mats; no one will be able to know about Param Purush.
When the three sons grow up, send them to churn the ocean.

himself engages people in worldly actions and burdens
everyone. This Mind will not let you meditate on Param
Purush. In the meditation, Mind only appears as light,
sound, etc.

When the three children grew up, Adishakti told them to
proceed on churning the Ocean but they were happy in play
and made no effort to go to Ocean. In between, this Kal
Purush has played a mischief. Kal Niranjan quickly created
Pavan from Yoga and when he released, Vedas came out of
his breath, he has created Vedas in Air (Vayu). Even this
secret is known to only the rare ones. It means, Vedas were
not the written books in essence. Ved contains praise of
Formless (Niraakar) and ordered Vedas to be in the Ocean
and to be with one who finds it during churning. Niranjan
spoke from the sky in the form of brilliant light but Ved did
not see his real form. That is why Ved says- 'It is unable to
comprehend the ultimate'. When Ved left, Niranjan created
effulgence and asked it to stay in the ocean. Then he has
created poison and directed it to stay in the ocean. After
Ved entered the ocean, Niranjan asked Adishakti in Dhyaan
'Why is the churning of ocean delayed? Pay attention to me,
tell the children to churn the ocean and with your blessing
send them. Tell them that they will get things from the
ocean'. After this instruction, Niranjan himself has entered
the ocean. On being instructed by Mother, Brahma
obediently went to the Ocean and Vishnuji and Shivji
followed him.

All the three sons reached the Ocean and stood there.
Looking at eachother, they contemplated on the way to
churn the ocean. When they churned the Ocean, they got all
the three things. Brahma got Veda, Vishnu got effulgence,
and Shivji got poison. Pleased with the gifts received, they
reached their Mother and showed their respective gifts to
her. She asked them to keep it for themselves.

Again, Adishakti has sent her children to the Ocean for
churning and told them to keep whatever they receive.
Adishakti made three female forms out of her own and
asked them to remain in the ocean. All the three of them,
merged in the ocean before the boys could reach. The boys
did not know about this. When the boys churned the Ocean,
they found the three Kanyas and they returned with them to
their Mother. Adishakti told them 'My sons! You all
received this with your own effort. So saying, she gave
each, one Kanya 'and said 'Brahma, You take Savitri'. She
gave Lakshmi to Vishnu and Parvati to Shiva and asked
them to stay together and enjoy. Bowing their heads all
three of them became so happy with their Kanyas like the
delighted Chakor (Indian red legged partridge) bird on

seeing the full moon. Infatuated with lust and stayed with
them enjoying the sexual pleasure in which Devtas (Demi-
gods) and Daityas (Demons) were born to them. Kabir sahib
tells his disciple Dharmadas that the mother with her own
essence became female partners of Trinity. Further from
Brahma and Vishnu, Devtas were produced and from Shivji
Daityas were produced.

Third time again, the mother asked her sons to churn the
Ocean. She told them not to delay and keep whatever they
get for themselves. All the three bowed down to their
mother and proceeded to the ocean playfully. They returned
to their Mother, she asked them to do the creation of life
forms. For creating Life forms, Adishakti has created beings
which are born out of egg (Andaj khaani -Oviferous) and
those who are born out of womb (Pindaj-Mammalian).
Insects (Ushmaj) are by Vishnuji and some Aquatic
species(Asthavar) were created by Shivji. This way, 84
lakhs of life forms have been created. They were placed on
the land and water.
Asthavar depends on single element water. In this, 9
lakh jivas are water borne. Insects are from two elements-
Air and Fire. In this 27 lakh jivas like worms and insects are
born. The egg born were out of water, fire and air element


**48 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
in which 14 lakh Jiv yonis are there. In the Pindaj khani,
there are 4 elements- Earth, water, fire and Air. In this, 30
lakhs Jiv yonis are there, because of the knowledge and
wisdom, only Humans have all the five elements and they
are entitled to attain salvation, not others.

While revealing the secret of creation of Kalpurush and
the creation of life forms, Kabir sahibji described why there
is a variation in knowledge and awareness among the jivas.
Sahib said- while in all the four categories of creation, the
Jiva (spirit) is same but because of the difference in
constituent of physical elements, their awareness and
knowledge are different. Asthavar (Aquatic) species are
created with one element-Water, in the Ukmaj there are two
elements, in Andaj there are three elements therefore they
cannot acquire wisdom (Gyaan arjan). In the Pindaj, they
have four elements. Among them, only Man has all the five


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **49**
elements present. Therefore, there is more power of
awareness and wisdom in Human. This is helpful for
developing devotion and meditation and they are successful
in acquiring worldly knowledge as well as spiritual wisdom.
_Chaar Khani Jiv Ek Aahi| Tatva Vishesh Ahey Sun Taahi||
So Ab Tumso Kaho Bakhani| Tatva Ek Asthavar Jaani||
Ushmaj Doy Tatva Parmana| Andaj Teen Tatva Gun Jana||
Pindaj Chaar Tatva Gun Kahiye| Paanch Tatva Manush Tan
Lahiye||
Taso Hoy Gyan Adhikari| Nar Ki Deh Bhakti Anusari||_
While clarifying the inquisitive disciple Dharmadas,
Kabir Sahib explained the reason for different level of
understanding among the men and women. He said that
after going through the four category of birth and Lakhs of
different yonis, Jiv gets Human birth. Man retains the
character and tendencies of his previous life form.
Therefore, even the Human yoni is of four lakhs types. To
keep them in ignorance and delusion, Kal Purush has kept
them in delusion of four categories of life forms.
_Dharmadaas Parkahu Chitt Laaiee| Nar Naari Gun Kahu
Samzaayee||
Chari Khani Jiv Bharmaya| Tab Le Nar Ki Dehi Paaya||
Deh Dharey Chhodey Jas Khana| Tasey Ka Kahu Gyaan

Sahib while explainig to Dharmadas, revealed the secret
that the Human body is one of great pleasure; in this it is
possible to engage in devotion to a Guru. Kal Niranjan has
created 84 Lakhs of life forms only for this human body
with the intention of keeping them Dull, Ignorant and
incapable of grasping the truth due to taking birth through
different types of wombs of life forms. Instead if he
continually takes birth in only Human body, then it is
possible for him to acquire devotion easily but with this
Niranjan's worldly work will not continue. Therefore, Atma
is put through 4 categories and 84 lakhs of life forms where
there is no wisdom and Atmic realisation is not possible.


**50 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
However, on taking a Human birth if it receives true alive
holy Naam, Atma will attain Amarlok.

## 4. Sound of seed letters are not Parampurush.

Niranjan has kept the five seed form of sounds with
which he has created the body of five elements at five
places within the body. To keep the Jivatmas away from
Param Purush (Supreme lord) and to keep them devoted to
himself, Kal Niranjan gave bodily Naams in the form of
Guru Mantra to Jivas, with which all the Jivas started
recitation and started the search within their body. Even the
big Rishi, Muni, Siddh, Sadhak, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh,
Peer, Paigambar and Auliya all are entangled in this. They
all taken this Five Naams as the Supreme lord and entangled
with it. Niranjan has rewarded his devotees with Riddhi,
Siddhi, Superhuman power, Strength, gave four types of
salvations to reach heavens, upto this aspirants remained
with the Sadhna of Kal Purush, some also remained in the
70 types of Anhad Dhun-Musical sounds and they were on
the search for the lonely places to listen to this Anhad Dhun
in silence. However, due to lack of Atmic awareness, Atma
could not seperate from the body and reach its true home-
Amarlok.
_Koti Naam sansar mein, tinte mukti na hoye.
Mool Naam jo gupat hai, janey birla koye._
Out of the innumerable ‘Naams’ prevalent on the earth, it
is only some rare saints who know the real ‘Naam’.
_Jap marey ajapa marey, anhad bhi mer jaye.
Surti samani shabad mein, usko kal na khaye._
He who recites Naam with mouth or inwardly or fixes his
concentration at musical sounds, will ultimately be
devoured by Niranjan. But he who fixes his concentration
at soundless sound will escape from the grip of Kal.
_Shabad shabad sabb koyi kahey, so to shabad videh.
Jibhya per avey nahin, nirakh parakh ke leh._
The real Naam (holy word) is in no way associated with
any material body.

## 5.THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

## YOGMAT (PATH OF YOG) AND

## SANTMAT (PATH OF SANT).

Yog Mat Sant Mat
In Yog Mat there is
Naam with a definite
Body.

In Sant Mat there is
Bodiless Naam (Soundless
sound).
It moves around five
postures (techniques of
meditation)—Chachri,
Bhuchri,Agochri, Unmuni
&Khechri that are present
in our body

```
Here the concentration is
fixed at a height of about 1¼
hands above the head at 8th
chakra-Seat of Satguru.
```
Here Naam falls within the
limit of 5 elements & is
used in our daily
expression.

Here Nam doesn’t fall
within the limit of 5
elements & is not used in
our daily expression.
Here the musical sounds
themselves are taken as
God.

Here Atma is not depend on
any other thing because it is
complete in itself.
It is a path of earning
merits through noble
deeds.

It is an easy path in which
the grace of Satguru is
considered as Supreme. Here
the Satguru turns the disciple
like himself.
Here Surti Shabad
(musical sounds for
fixing concentration) is
practised.

```
Here awareness is being
created in our Surti.
```
Here the disciples are
blessed with Naam of Kal
Niranjan that is associated
with the body.

Here the disciples are
blessed with a living Naam
of Parampurush that is
associated with Soul.
Here a Guru has almost no
role to play, only your

```
Here the very essense
of worship is the
```

T h e Forml e s s M i n d **53**

effort. Sant Satguru for his grace.
It has definite limits. Here
the devotee can reach upto
the 10th aperture-
Sahastrasaar only.

It is limitless. It takes you
through the 11th aperture
that lies within our Surti
(concentration).
Yog Mat considers the
formless Niranjan as the
Supreme Lord.

In Sant Mat, Parampurush is
the Supreme lord and
attainment of the 4th loka
(Amarlok) that lies far
beyond the limit of 3 lokas
of Niranjan.
Here the jiva has to return
again to the material world
after exhausting the fruit
of noble deeds.

Here the jiva attains
permanent salvation & will
never return back to this
mortal world.
It does not function
independently& depends
on the teachings of
religious scriptures.

Here the Satguru speaks out
of his inner experiences.He
do not require support of any
scriptures.
Here with efforts the jiva
attains miraculous powers
but not the spiritual
wisdom.

```
Here the jiva can attains
spiritual powers and true
spiritual wisdom by the
grace of Satguru.
```
It is the path of Meen &
Papeel.(moving like a fish
or an ant)

It is the path of Vihangam.
(flying to Amarlok like a
Bird-extraordinary speed).
There are five steps in Yog
Mat & all of these are
within the control of Kal
Purush.

```
Sant Mat is related to the
direct worship of the
Satguru.
```
Nirgun meditation is the
worship related to the inner
of the cells within the
body& is under the control
of Kal Purush.

```
The meditation of the
bodiless Naam and it is by
the union of Surti
(Concentration) and Nirati
(Praana) on the eighth
```

**54 |** S a hi b B a n d g i

chakra outside the body.It
has direct connection with
Parampurush of Amarlok.
_Panch Shabd Au Pancho Mudra, Soyi Nishchey Ker Mana|
Aage Puran Purush Puratan, Uski Khabar Na Jana||_
People remained entangled in the limits of five words
and five postures only and took the respective heights
attained by them as the ultimate reality. However, they did
not know that secret of Param Purush who resides far
beyond these limits.
_Nau Nath Chaurasi Siddh Laun, Panch Shabd Mein Atke|
Mudra Sadh Rahain Ghat Bheeter, Phir Aundhe Munh Latke||_
Nine Naths (Gorakhnath, Machhindernath etc.), 84
Siddhs etc. of olden times remained entangled within the
limit of 5 words mentioned before. They fixed their
concentration through the said postures but had once again
to hang upside down in the womb of their mothers.
_Panch Shabad Aur Panchon Mudra, Lok Dweep Jamjala|
Kahain Kabir Akshar Ke Aage, Ni Akshar Nahin Pahichana||_
The five words and the five postures are nothing but the
network of the lord of death. Kabir Sahib says that none can
recognize the ‘wordless’ that lies beyond the limit of words.
_Kaya Naam Sab hin Gun Gavai, Videh Naam Koyi Virla Pavai|
Videh Naam Pavey Ga Soyi, Jiska Satguru Sancha Hoyi||_
All are singing in praise of Naam that has some definite
form but it is only some rare one who gets blessed up with
the formless Naam. And only a devotee who has sought the
shelter of some Perfect spiritual Master can get blessed with
this holy Naam.
_Jab Tak Guru Miley Nahin Sancha|
Tab Tak Karo Guru Dus Pancha||_
One can seek the shelter of even five or ten gurus by the
time one is able to find some perfect Satguru. Kabir sahib
compares Sant mat with the righteous conduct (Dharma-
Inner and Outer purity) of Vaishnovites. Compassion of
Jains and the devotion to one Supreme power of Islam. The


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **55**
combination of these three similar principles; purity in
thought word and deed, Ahimsa (non-injury to any being)
and devotion only to the Satguru who is the form of
Parampurush are the basis of Sant Mat and are contained in
the seven rules and practices of Sahib Bandgi, Satguru
Bhakti.

## 6. Mind and maya are one and the same.

Mind and Maya is one and the same, Maya is present in
the Mind. Therefore, there is confusion in all the three
worlds, all are unable to comprehend this entanglement.
Sahib says to whom all I have to explain-
_Man Maya Toh Ek hey, Maya Manhi Samaay|
Tin Lok Sans Padi, Kahey Kahu Samuzay||_
Maya has emerged from Mind, from which Vishnu got
Satwagun, Brahma has Rajogun and Shivji got Tamogun.
These three are born to Maya (Adi Shakti) and Maan
(Kalniranjan). In reality, the five elements are Maya; with it
the body is made out of it to bound Jivas. Maya is the power
of attraction (Mohini Shakti) of Mind; to which human,
muni, devtas, etc. are fascinated. Through the Maya, mind
swallows every person of the three Lokas but nobody could
eat Maya. Kabir Sahibji says-
_Maya Tey Man Upjey, Maya Trigun Roop|
Paanch Tatva Key Mel Mey, Bandhey Sakal Saroop||
Maya Man Ki Mohini, Surr Nar Rahey Lubhaay||
En Maya Sab Khahiya, Maya Koi Na Khaay||_
Mind is the universe (Mano moolam idam jagat) and the
five elements are Maya. The created universe from the five
elements is also Maya. In this way Maya becomes a part of
Mind.Our body made of this five elements is also Maya.In
this body, only Mind remains with the Atma. Mind and
Maya together robs everyone in this three worlds. Mind and
Maya never dies nor does the desire and ambition. ....The


**56 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
one which dies repeatedly is only body. Everybody gives up
the gross Maya of Wealth, Wife, Son, House etc. However,
no one is able to give up the subtle Maya, which is in the
form of Ego. Sahibji says that this Subtle Maya even eats up
big Pir-Paigambar-Auliya.
_Maya Seti Mati Milo, Jo Sovariya Dehi|
Naarad Se Munivar Galey, Kya Bharosa Tohi||
Maya Mui Na Man Mua, Mari Mari Gaya Sharir||
Asha Trushna Na Mui, Yo Kathi Kahey Kabir||
Moti Maya Sab Tajey, zini Taji Na Jaay|
Pir Paigambar Auliya, zini Sabko Khaay||_
Mind tricks everyone in this world into meritorious and
sinful deeds, the whole world is engaged in this activity.
None are able to realise this. It is the Mind which has put
the Jiva into the 84 lakhs of life forms. This Mind has
tricked and cheated Surr-Nar-Muni-Devta and the Mind
itself has manifested as Avtars. It is the Mind, which
appears in front as a Savior. Those unique persons, who
take to the feet of Satguru for realization of this truth, only
they can transcend this three world and reach Amarlok. It is
the mind which becomes benefactor, it becomes greedy. It
becomes heart of a King, it takes the form of a miser. If this
Mind meets a Satguru, it can dissolve in him.
Sahib said-
_Surr Naar Muni Sabko Thagey, Manhi Liya Avtar|
Jo Koi Yatey Bachey, Tin Lok Se Nyaar||
Baat Banai Jag Thagyo, Man Parmodha Naahi|
Kahe Kabir Man Le Gaya, Lakh Chourasi Maahi||
Man Daata Man Lalchi, Man Raja Man Rank|
Jo Yaha Man Guru So Miley Toh Guru Miley Nisank||_
While clarifying to Jivatmas, Kabir Sahibji has said-
"Oh Jivatma! This Mind itself is Niranjan, the one who
deludes you Yuga after Yuga. You are the Hansatma of
Amarlok but coming under Kalpurush you became
helpless."
The Alakh Niranjan, nobody can see him, has bound
everyone with the worldly ocean of life (Sansar). Taking his


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **57**
Maya as real, the ignorant Jivas are bound by themselves. In
the similar manner, the whole creation is in entanglement,
instead of churning the curd they are churning the water.
Just like the Chakor bird takes burning amber into his
mouth mistaking it as Moon. When it gets burning sensation
in the beak, it gives up. Again, he picks up the burning
amber due to its attachment to Moon and suffers a lot.
Similarly, people of this world have taken the formless
Niranjan as their supreme Lord. All are marching towards
him and are devoted to him. Finally, they earn endless
suffering. They are not able to overcome rebirth and they
are revolving in 84 lakhs of Life forms created by Niranjan.
Do not follow the dictates of Mind; it always vacillates.
Sometimes it says something, sometimes otherwise. It is
always seeking to satisfy the body. It never does anything
beneficial for the sake of Atma. Those who ignore the
dictates of Mind and instead directs the Mind, such a rare
Jiva becomes a sant.
_Man Hi Saroopi Dev Niranjan, Tohi Raha Bharmai||
Hey Hansa Tu Amarlok Ka Pada Kal Vash Aai||
Alakh Niranjan Lakhey Na Koi, Jihi Bandhey Bandha Sab Lei|
Jehi zuthe Sab Bandhu Ayana, zuthi Baat Sanch Key Mana||
Man Ke Matey Na Chaliye, Man Key Matey Anek|
Jo Man Par Asawar Hey, Aisa Sadhu Koi Ek||_
This body is an abode of five elements, twenty five
attributes and Three Characters, in these the pure and
eternal Atma is imprisoned by Kalniranjan.
_Man Hi Saroopi Dev Niranjan, Tohi Raha Bharmai|
Panch Pachis Tin Ka Pinjada, Jamey Tohi Rakha Bharmai||_
What, is it that we are all in the grip of Satanic power?
We hear that without the will of Ishwar, not even a leaf can
move. Everything is under his direction but then how is that
we feel that we are under a satanic power? Sants also
described it very early that- _Sayyad ke kabu mey hey, sab jiv
Bicharey|_ One thing is becoming clear from the words of
sant that this worlds are under a satanic power.
_Yaha Sansar Kal Ko Desha, Bina Naam Na Katey Kalesha|_


**58 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
This is not a baseless imagination. It has truth. Brothers,
how realistic is this? Are we not in the world of Supreme
lord! Is our welfare is not in the hands of Supreme lord!
Sants have brought a spiritual renaissance-
_Rushi Muni Gan Gandharv Aru Deva| Sab Mil Lag Niranjan
Seva||_
They repeatedly warned us, believe that-
_Teen Lok Mey Yum Ka Raaj| Chauthey Lok Naam Nivaran||
Chal Hansa Satlok, Chhod Yaha Sansara|
Yaha Sansar Kal Ka Desha, Karam Ka Jaal Pasara||_
Let us see whether whole world is in the control of
Kalpurush. If we make an enquiry, we can understand that
the individuals are not in the control of a good hand. When
there are too many thefts and the crimes increases, we say
that this is the failure of Government and we also blame the
police for the crime. Then why are we not enquiring that the
state of affairs of the Brahmand- Universe are proper? If we
ponder over it, we do not see anyone who is Atma centric or
spirit oriented. Some are stealing, some are engaged in
immoral activity, some are engaged in deceptive and
wicked activities. Never do we see anyone conducting
himself in the spirit of Atma and Ishwar. Further, we see
earthquake, storm, cyclone, wildfire, flood etc. such
destructions takes place around the world. We have a train
crash, plane crash and vehicle crash incidents where in lot
of innocent people are hurt and many lose their lives. Are
these actions befitting the characteristics of the Lord? Why
does he put all in such a condition? The nature of the
Supreme Lord is benevolence and same is that of Atma.
Every individual, work for the benefit and the welfare of
their children. Is that the Paramatma never thinks about the
welfare of the Jivatmas,who are the part of his own. It is
evident that all are in the control of a cruel power.
Therefore, there is growing misery everywhere.We see that,
only those selfish people who are fraudulent and wicked are


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **59**
having comfortable lives. They have the Goddess of
prosperity with them.
Who is that satanic power! It is the Mind. Mind is the
Kalniranajan, Nirakar (Formless). Only his rule prevails. It
is same in the evil or meritorious deeds. Lust and hatred are
present in everyone. Everybody has the same hunger and
thirst, everyone has laziness in them. Character of Atma is
not seen anywhere. Mind does not have holiness, simplicity,
purity and bliss, which are the natures of eternal Atma.
Even if you feed delicious food to a bird inside the cage, it
cannot enjoy, because it is not free, it is imprisoned.
Similarly, Atma is under imprisonment. All are prisoners
here, under the control of the Mind.
Mind is the biggest enemy of Man. In our body, Atma's
effort doesn't work, only Mind's orders are carried out.
Therefore, there is always dissatisfaction, desires and vows,
enmity and quarrels. Not only the ordinary humans, even
great men of penance, renounciates (Sanyasi), etc. are
unable to free themselves from the Mind. All have engaged
in Kam-Krodh-Lobh-Moh-Ahankar. We see the evidence of
Bhrugu Rishi, Parshuram and Durvasa Rishi, they did
severe penance and but they succumbed to anger. Shringi
Rishi lot himself to lust.
We all say that Atma should attain liberation. Therefore
it is evident that someone has imprisoned Atma. Mind
makes the Jivas to dance, no one could see this. Everybody
is dancing to the beat of Mind and Atma is not doing
anything. Atma is disturbed and cannot find its way. It is
bound with the karmas of Mind and its results. Atma seated
in the body, assuming it to be its home, it is engaged in
Karmas and its consequences. Pleasure-Pain, to sleep, to
rise are qualities of Mind but man wants to live for this
alone. To fulfill the needs of the body, all are engages in
action. Some are engaged in agricultural work, some in
employment, some in business and they are making palatial
houses. All these are for appeasing the Hunger and


**60 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
sheltering the body from weather. Nobody does anything to
their Atma, all the activities are not for the realisation of
Atma. Even though it sounds madness, but it is true.
_Santo Yaha Jag Bauraana|
Sanch Kaho Toh Maaran Dhavey,
Zoote Jag Patiyana||
Kehi Samuzavo Yaha Jag Andha|
Sabhey Lago Hai Pet Ka Dhandha||_
Mind rides on all. All are engaged in action by the
dictates of Mind. People are unable to understand the words
of Sant and they become inimical. Kabir Sahib says that he
can't find anyone to share his grief. Whomever I try to make
him understand, he becomes my opponent.
_Esa Koi Na Miley, Jasu Kahu Dukh Roye|
Jaaso Kahiye Bhed Ki, Vo Phir Bairi Hoi||_
Watching the sufferings of the Human in the mill of 84
lakhs of Jivas by Kal Purush, sants have saddened. World is
unable to comprehend this truth therefore they (Jiv) turn
against Sants. Sahib says-
_Kal Ka Jeev Maney Nahi, Mey Kotin Karo Upaay||
Mey Kinchat Hu Satlok Ko, Vo Bandha Yampur Jaai||_
Like the frog in the well, they do not want to free from
the grip of the Kal Purush. There is a story that a man was
on his way. He felt thirsty and saw a well on the way. He
went there to fetch water with a bucket and a rope. He saw a
frog inside the well and thought that it has no way to come
out. He attempted to help remove the frog from the well
with the bucket. After struggling for a long time, he brought
the frog out of the well. As it came out, looked at the man
and the surroundings tree,etc. and jumped back into the
well, so the Man thought that he has struggled to take it out,
but why did the frog jumped back.
Similarly, from the well of Mind and Maya, Sants
attempt to extricate the Jivas, however jivas are searching
for pleasures in the well itself. Their behaviour is matter of
concern. In reality, Atma is blissfull that is why they are
searching for it outside. Why are the Jivas searching for


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **61**
pleasure in the well of Maya (illution) is the matter to think
over. Out of ignorance, Jivas are looking for Atmic bliss in
the external world. The whole life, men are engaged in
activities for the pleasure, due to ignorance he wonders in
search like Muskdeer who searches for the musk outside.
Mind makes every human to live for the body and pleasure
of senses. For the comfort and pleasures, he commits sins.
We are living for the impermanent body. _'Aakhir yaha tan
khak milega, kaha firat magruri mey'._
Once, Akbar asked Birbal- "What is the dearest thing in
this world?" Birbal answered- "Our own life." Akbar
disagreed and said- "No, it is our family." Birbal thought
that he will make him understand. He has a wonderful way
of explaining things. He has asked Akbar- "Who has more
love towards their offsprings?" Akbar answered that it was
the monkeys. It is true that monkeys does love their babies.
Let us see how much they love! ...One day Birbal made a
four walls and spread the floor with sand under the sun. the
sand was hot. He let a female monkey with its baby inside.
The monkey was running around with her baby inside the
four walls, it was searching for a way out to escape. She did
not allow baby to touch the sand. It became unbearably hot
for the monkey. It kept the baby monkey on the sand and sat
over it. Emperor Akbar was troubled by the sight.
In the same way, nobody is going to accompany you,
when the final moment arises. Kabir Sahib has narrated this
in his words-
_Man Phula Phula Phire Jagat Mey, Kaisey Nata Re|
Mata Kahey Yaha Putra Hai Mera, Bahin Kahey Bir Mera Re|
Bhai Kahey Yaha Bhuja Hamari, Nari Kahey Nar Mera Re|

_Soney Ki Si Kaya Jari Gayi, Koi Na Aaye Pasa Re|
Kahe Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Chhodo Jag Ki Asaa Re|_
We are unable to comprehend the enemy who is in the
form of Mind. Mind is the doer of all action and it itself is
Niranjan. They call him as Bhagwan. Sant called him as
Kalpurush. He is the ruler of all the three worlds. It is the
Mind, which binds us. It is only the Mind, which prompts
you to make your son as an engineer or doctor; it also tells
you to earn money. This Mind only tells you to make two
additional rooms in your House. Why is it so? Because, the
Mind wants to destroy the precious time you have. Further,
it is only the Mind, which entangles you in Karmas, which
becomes the cause for Atma to take rebirth in 84 lakhs of
life forms. Human body is a door of wisdom for liberation.
Therefore, Mind keeps defeating this purpose. Mind will
never let you tread the path of True Devotion (Satya
Bhakti). This is the cause for affliction in Devotion.
Kabir Sahib has reveled secrete of Vedas, the sensual
engagement (Rati kriya) of Brahma with Gaytri and
Puhupavati and then secrete of Vishnu and Shiva, their
Maya-Leela to his Disciple Dharmadas. Kalniranjan and
Adi-Shakti engaged the tridevs in the churning of Ocean
and gave them things for creation. Therefore, in the
devotion to Avatars of trinities, Mind and Maya are
involved.

**Brahma learned secretes from the veda: Adishakti
concealed**
Brahma came to know that there exist a Purush from the
Vedas that he received from churning the ocean and that
Purush is formless. In the void above the space, there
appears a mass of light meaning that Kal Niranjan's head is
in heaven and feet is in hell. Trying to visualise Niranjan
with the chitt is not possible. This information made
Brahma insane. The four-faced Brahma told Vishnu that
Veda says that there is adi purush in existence. He told


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **63**
Shiva also from churning of the Vedas he has come to
known the existence of Adi Purush. Vedas has indicated the
existence of the Purush. However, it also claims to have no
awareness of it. Then Brahma went to Adishakti and bowed
his head reverentially. He told her- "Oh Mata! Ved gives the
information that there is someone else for the creation. Oh
Janani! Where is your husband, graciously tell me where is
our father? Ved has declared that there is a Purush who is
hidden. You concentrate deeply on your Memory (Chitt).

Janani Adishakti has said- "Oh Brahma, listen you dont
have any father, all creations arouse from me and I am the
sustainer." Brahma said- "Oh Mother, listen to me
attentively. Vedas says that there is a purush who is hidden.
_Kahey Janani Sunhu Brahma,Kou Nahi Janak Tumhar Ho||
Hamhitey Bhai Sab Utpatti, Hamhi Sab Kin Samhar Ho||

Mata said- "Oh Brahma! There is none other than me in
the creation. I am the creator of hell, heaven and earth and
also the creator of seven seas.
_Kahey Aadya Sunu Brahma Kumara|Mausey Nahi Kou Srushta
Nyaara||
Swarg Mrutyu Pataal Banai|Saat Samundar Hum Nirmaai||_
Then Brahma asked- "You have created everything, if it
so why you have not disclosed earlier, why did you hide?
When Ved tells me that there is a Purush, Nirakar-Niranjan


**64 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
exists and you are saying that you are the creator. If it so,
you are the creator of Veda too, then why did you talk about
Alakh Niranjan as creator. Why did'nt you declare in the
Veda, that you are the creator? Now you do not trick me
and reveal me the truth."
_Mano Vachan Tumhi Sab Kinha|Pratam Gupt Tum Kas Rakh

When Brahma argued about the creator, Adishakti
thought that he is not accepting her as a creator, how to
convince him? If I talk about Niranjan, how will he
understand? Niranjan has told me that nobody can see him.
If Brahma wants to see, what can I do? Thinking so, she
told brahma that no one could have the darshan of Alakh
Niranjan.
_Jab Brahma Yahi Vidhi Hath Thana|Tab Adya Mann Kinha Tivana||

Brahma was not satisfied with her answer. Therefore,
Brahma asked her to tell him about Niranjan's whereabouts.
Do not confuse me with your words, I will not accept
anymore. First, you told me that there is none then; you are
telling that he cannot be seen. Your speech is unpleasant.
How strange it is that, Son cannot see his father.

Adishakti said- "Oh Brahma! Listen to me, I am
speaking the truth that up to the seven skies is his Head and
in the seven patal is his Feet.".--
_Kahey Janani Suno Brahma, Kaho Toso Satt Hi|

Shakti pondered in her Chitt, Brahma is not accepting
my words because He received message from the Veda.
However, he will not get the vision. She told Brahma that
Alakh Niranjan is your father but you cannot see him,
accept my word. Listening to these, Brahma was disturbed
and fell at her feet said that he will return only after the
vision of his father. Adishakti said-"If you are interested,
take this flower and go, if you find him, offer it to him and
bow down your head." Then Brahma took the flower and
went up in the northern direction, in search of Niranjan.

Vishnuji after paying his obeisance to his mother,
moved towards patal to see his father but Shivji did not go
anywhere. He continued to serve his mother. This way a
long time passed, mother thought about her children.
_Aagya Mangi Vishnu Chaley Baala| Pita Darash Ko Chaley Patala||

**66 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
First Vishnuji returned to his mother and narrating his
journey, he said that he could not have the vision of his
father's feet.
_Pratham Vishnu Janani Dhig Aaye|
Apni Katha Kahi Samuzaaye||
Bethyo Naahi Mohi Pagu Tata| Vish Jwala Syamal Bhaugata||_
Pleased with Vishnu, she blessed him, she lovingly
touched his face and said- "You spoke the truth." Then she
asked- "My son, when you left to see your father, you were
very fair then tell me how come you have returned with the
color of ash (shyam varn)."

Vishnuji said- "After I took flower from you, I went to
patal on the way I met Sheshnaag. Due to his influence, I
fell unconscious and my body turned ash in color. Then he
told me to return and tell you the truth. Further, sheshnaag
has said after the passage of Satyug and Tretayug,
Dwaparyug will come. You will take the avatar of Krishna,
then you can take revenge on me. In the Kalindi river, you
will deal with that poisoness Cobra snake. Now, you return
immediately, make no effort. Listening to him I returned to
you and because of the poison, my complexion changed. I
did not get the Darshan of father's feet."

There in the Shunya, Brahma spent many Yugas in
meditation; still he could not get the vision of Niranjan.
Adishakti was worried about Brahmaji's condition; how to
continue with the creation and how to call Brahma.
_Brahma Tat Darash Nahi Paya|Shunya Dhyaan Maha Bahu Jaya||
Mata Chinta Karat Man Maha| Jeth Putra Brahma Rahu Kaha||
Kinhi Vidhi Rachna Rachahu Banai| Brahma Avey Koun Upai||_
Then Adishakti rubbing her body produced a Kanya and
she gave her power and called her Gaytri. Gaytri bowed
down to Adishakti and touched her feet, with her folded
hand she asked: "Oh Janani, what is the purpose of my
creation. I will take your word on my head."
_Ubti Sharir Mail Gahi Kadhi|Putri Roop Kinha Rachi Thadhi||

Adishakti has said- oh daughter! Your elder brother
Brahma has gone to take the Darshan of Father. He will not
have his darshan even if he spends the long time. Therefore,
you go to him and somehow you bring him back here.
_Kahe Aadya Putri Sunu Bhata| Brahma Aahi Jeth hi Tub Bhrata||

She listened to Adishakti enduringly and went in search.
As she went, she kept words of Adishakti in her heart.
_Chali Gayatri Marag Aai|Janani Vachan Priti Chitt Layi||
Chalat Bhai Marag Sukumari|Janani Vachan Dhyaan Urr Dhari||_
She saw Brahmaji seated in deep meditation with his
eyes closed and body stilled, not even a wink from the eye.
Gayatri watched for few days and contemplated on solution
and method to wake him up. After sometime, she meditated
on her Mother Adishakti. In the Dhyaan, Adishakti


**68 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
indicated to her to touch the feet of Brahma with her hand,
which will awaken him. Gayatri did as she was instructed.
Pulling herself, she slightly touched the feet of Brahmaji.
_Jay Dekhyo Chaturmukh Kaha, Nahi Palak Ugharai|

Brahma’s concentration was disturbed and he became
annoyed. Agitated, He said-'Who is the sinner who did this
to me?" my samadhi is disturbed. My meditation on Father
is interrupted and I will find and curse the person who did it
to me.
_Brahma Jag Dhyaan Man Dalo| Vyakul Bhayo Bachan Tab Bola||
Kavan Ahey Papin Apradhi| Kaha Chudayahu Mori Samadhi||

Gayatri immediately responded that there is no sin on
my part. I am telling you the truth. Your mother has sent
me, to bring you back therefore return immediately. without
you, how can there be creation. You cannot have the vision
of your father. Return immediately otherwise you will
regret.

Brahma said-"How can I return?" I am yet to see my
Father. If you can say in my favor, that I had darshan of my
father's head then I will accompany you but you have to
explain it to your mother.
_Brahma Kahe Kaun Vidhi Jaau| Pita Daras Ajahu Nahi Paau||

Gayatri said- Oh one with the vedic wisdom! I do not
speak lies. However if you satisfy my interests, I will make
a lie and tell. Brahma said, asked me without hesitation,
what you want. Gayatri said, "Engage with me in sensual
pleasure (Ratikriya). Then I can tell lies".
_Kaha Gayatri Sun Shrut Dhari| Hum Nahi Mithya Vachan Uchari||

Listening to this, Brahma thought as to what he can do.
If I do not oblige her, she will not speak in my favor to
Mother. It does not be-hove on my part that mother will
radicule and say that I had gone to see father and even this
can not accomplished after spending so much of time. If I
look at the sin, my work cannot be completed therefore, as
per the desire of Gayatri, I will do Ratikriya. By the
sacrifice of Ratikriya, Brahmaji gave up the desire of seeing
his father- Niranjan.
_Yaha Sun Brahma Chit Karey Vichara| Ab Ka Yatan Karahu Ihi

Both of them became impulsive from which wicked
mentality appeared. Then Brahma told-"Let us go to
mother". Gayatri replied- let us device one more plan, we
will create one more witness. Brahma responded- It is a
good idea, do that which will convince mother. She took
some dirt from the body and created a Kanya, she gave her
essence to her. She named her as Savitri. Gayatri asked her
to tell to mother that Brahmaji had the darshan of the father.
Savitri said that it is harmful to oneself to bear false witness
I have not seen anything. Listening to her, Brahma and
Gayatri worried, they thought that they got into more
complications. Gayatri tried to convince her in many ways


**70 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
but Savitri was not mentally prepared. When Gayatri tried
again Savitri said if Brahma does Rati kriya with her then,
for that she will be willing to tell the lie. Then Gayatri told
Brahma that for the sake of their goal Brahma should do the
Ratikriya. Brahmaji by doing Ratikriya with Savitri, he took
more sins on his head. Savitri has said that she should be
addressed as Puhupavati. Now all the three of them reached
Adishakti. They offered their salutation to Adishakti.
Adishakti asked about their well being and said- "Oh
Brahma! Have you had the darshan of your father and
where from you have bought this other woman?" Brahma
has told his mother that these two are the witness for
darshan of father and he touched their head.

Listening to this and pondering over it, Adishakti asked
Gayatri- "Did you witness Brahma taking darshan of his
father, tell me the truth; how was the darshan?" Gayatri has
said- "Brahmaji had the darshan of head of Jagdish and he


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **71**
also touched the head. Sprinkled water and offered flower. I
watched with my own eyes. Oh Mother! This is the truth.
With that flower, Puhupavati arouse from the father, she
also had the darshan of father. You can ask her. I am
speaking the truth; there is not even an iota of falsehood in
this."
Adishakti asked Puhupavati- "Did Brahmaji had darshan
of the father?"
Pampavati (Puhupavati) bearing falsehood said- "Oh
Mata! I never step back from truth. The Four faced Brahma
had darshan and sparshan (touch) of his father, take this as
truth."

**Brahma got cursed, Vishnu and Shiva received
Boons**
The evidence given by Gayatri and Puhupavati
perplexed Adishakti because Niranjan has told that no one
can never see him. Adishakti did not know the secret that all
three are speaking lies. Shakti meditated and asked Niranjan
whether they have taken his Darshan. Niranjan replied in
Dhyaan that they all are telling lies and nobody has seen


**72 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
Him. Niranjan has told her that Brahma did not have his
darshan and those two gave false witness.

Listening to Alakh – Niranjan, she was saddened and she
cursed Brahma that no one will offer prayer to him, sitting
at my feet, you uttered lies. Telling lies, you also indulged
in sinful acts. Your progeny in the creation will speak lies.
In your lineage, all will display observance of rules,
regulations, and ceremonies. However, internally, Mind will
spread sinful thoughts. Likewise, if the devotees of Vishnu
become egoistic, they will go to Hell. Those who render
moral stories to others and fail to keep them up themselves,
will endure miseries in life. Those who listen to such
preachers and take themselves as devotees and claim to be
the part essence of Devas, they will undergo suffering and
ultimately end up in the Mouth of Kal Purush. Performing
ceremonial rituals to the gods and demigods, they will cause
much trouble to people for money (Dakshina). Their
disciples also will follow them and they will not be a seeker
of the highest truth (Paramarthi-Spiritualist). They will be
unable to go to a high Spiritual level and they will speak on
Shastras to others. They will speak on the self-centered
knowledge and they will make others to revere them. They
will seek reverential worship for themselves therefore; they
will be distinct from being a Paramarthi. They will take
themselves as superior and look down upon others. Your
offspring's reputation will be fraudulent.
Hearing the curse of Mother, Brahmaji fell unconscious
on the ground.

Adishakti cursed Gayatri and said- Become a cow, you
will have many Bulls as husband and you will have five to
seven off springs. From the mouth that you have spoken lie,
you shall take night soil. For your own self-satisfaction, you
have spoken lies, with what intention you gave this witness.
Gayatri has accepted the curse. Then Mother looked at
Savitri.

Adishakti then cursed Puhupavati and said- By telling
lie, you have destroyed your life. Nobody will trust you
now. You lied that you are born out of flower. Therefore,
become the flower of Keli (Pandarnus odoratissimus). You
seek sexual gratification, now, you face the hell. Wherever
you are foul smell will emanate. You will grow on garbage

On receiving the curse, Brahma, Gayatri and Savitri,
their intellect were corrupted because of the bad action and
they were saddened. Sahib tells Dharmadas, the violent
blow of Kalpurush is on everyone. A lustful woman
(Kamini) in the form of illusion stings everyone,no one can
escape. Brahma, Shiva, Sankadi, Narad, etc none of them
could escape from its bite. Oh Dharmadas! Only a rare
being can escape from it, those who are bestowed with the
Real Naam from a Satguru and who remain absorbed in Sat
Naam (Gurumukh).

After all the three of them were cursed, Adishakti was
mentally disturbed and she thought as to why she did not
forgive them. She thought about Niranjan's possible
reaction. Niranjan spoke from the sky, "Oh Bhavani, what
have you done? I have told you to carry on with this
creation, but what a scene you have created.

Niranjan said-"In future if any strong person offends
weak, I shall put him in misery." Niranjan cursed Adishakti
that when the Dwapar Yug comes, Draupadi will have five
husbands, they will be your sons without father. Listening
to Niranjan, Adishakti kept quiet. She thought mentally that
she reaped curse for curse. She said- "Oh Niranjan, I am
under your control. Therefore, do as you pleased."

Vishnu told the truth therefore, She took Vishnu on her
lap and said- "My son, I will show your Father. Mind is the
creator and the basis for hell, heaven and earth. No one can
see the Mind. Take My words to your heart and look
through the dhyan. Mind gives stability as well as
vacillation. Within a moment, it can create infinite
thoughts. Everyone is under the direction of Formless
Mind-Nirakar Maan always." Then, she helped Vishnu have
darshan of light in void space-Shunya. Reverse your breath
and move it to the space in void. Vishnu did as Adishakti
told, with his Mind, then Mind revealed itself to Vishnu."
Niranjan-Mind showed himself as mass of light. Vishnu
was delighted, fell at the feet of his mother, and said- "Oh
Janani! By your grace, I had the darshan of Paramatma
(Jagdish).

Kabir Sahib revealed the secret to his disciple
Dharmadas that it is in the nature of Kal Purush, Vishnu did
not get to know Param Purush. Adishakti had shown the
darshan of Niranjan-poisoness Mind but did not disclose
about the nectarine Param Purush. Adishakti has become a


**76 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
pray to the tricks of Mind-Niranjan and she obliged him. It
is like moth's love for flame-light, it gives up life when it is
exposed to the flame. In the same way, Jyotiswaroop-
Niranjan (mass of light) never lets anyone stay alive. He
had swallowed crores of Vishnu, Avatars, playing with the
lives of Brahma and Shiv, he has consumed them. Then
what to say of miserable life of ordinary people. Kal
Niranjan consumes 1 lakh people a day, he is such a
dangerous butcher.

Kabir Sahib also said to Dharmadas the reason for why
Adishakti did not disclose the details of Parampurush. She
only gave the knowledge of Kal Niranjan. Why did she
make such a story, leaving out parampurush she only talked
about Kal? Adishakti has created such tendency among
women of the world. When a daughter is at home, she is
kept with a loving care and when she goes to her husband's
home, she is lost to them, she falls in love with them and
forgets her home. Adishakti did the same, she has become
alien. That is why; she has shown only Kal Purush to
Vishnuji.

The elder son Brahma got repremented. Now, fondling
with the love, she said to Vishnuji- "You will be the lord of

Devlok. The elder son Brahma has become distinct from me
because of his lies and sinful deeds. All the Devas (Angles
and Demi-Gods) will have reverence for you and all will

Mother Adishakti went and asked Shivji- "Oh Shivji!
Ask me from your heart. What do you want? I promise you
that whatever you ask, I shall give you." Then Shivji told
her with his folded hand- "Oh Mata! With your permission,
I seek only one boon that my body should be immortal. Be
gracious, let me live in this body forever."

The eight armed one (Ashtangi) said- "Oh Shiva, that is
impossible, nobody has become immortal. When you do
Tapas with Pavan Yog, you can live for four Yugas. Your
body will remain as long as the earth, sky, the Brahmand, and
your body will not suffer.

Brahma with deep depression went to Vishnuji and
pleaded with him- "Oh my companion! You are first among
the Devas. You are blessed with the grace of mother and I
am burdened with the curse and dejected. I am reaping the
consequences of my action, mother cannot be blamed. Oh
Brother! Help me so that my linage will survive and
mother's word will stay.

Vishnuji has said to Brahma- "You are my elder brother
and I am the younger. Therefore, banish the worry from
your Mind, I shall serve you. My devotees, whatever
offering (Yagya, Kirtan, Havan, Dhan etc.) they make, it
will be useful to your family." Therefore, taking the
Brahmins as the descendant of Brahma, people perform all
the offerings with their help.
Listening to this Brahmaji felt very happy, the stain on
his chitt disappeared because now he is sure that his family
will be happy. They are living comfortably even with
crookedness and wicked activities.

Revealing the secret of this creation, Kabir Sahib has
said- " Other than Adishakti, no one knows the Mind in the
form of Niranjan. Adishakti, the embodiment of nature has
hidden the secret of Niranjan. She has bound even Brahma,
Vishnu and Mahesh with body and engaged them in Karmic
activity and its consequences, gave them the responsiblity
of creation. Adishakti, because of her participation with
Niranjan subjected all Jivas into illusion. It is only a
Satguru, who has the power of Satya Naam, with which he
can release the Atma from Niranjan and take it to the eternal
world of Param Purush.
_Gan Gandharva Rushi Muni Aru Deva|
Sab Mil Lag Niranjan Seva||_


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **79**
This way, Kabir Sahib disclosed that all are
unknowingly doing worship of Kalpurush. Why are the
worldly people engaged in wrongful worship? There must
be a reason. When we look around, it is evident that, some
are worshipping the tree, some worship the river, some are
worshipping the stone and all think that it is true devotion. It
is not the fault of the people. Some people assuming the role
of agent for their selfishness are engaging others in all these
activities. Atma is part essence of Param Purush, inspite of
this they are worshipping Kal Purush. _'Jo rakshak taha
chinhat nahi, jo bhakshak taha dhyaan lagaai|'_
If someone installs an idol on some mountain and claims
that it is of Treta Yuga, people start to flow such place.
People accept that idol as God and pray for it.They will say
that if you bow your head there, all your work and wishes
will be accomplished. Similarly, people convert some burial
ground and claim that it is the Samadhi of so and so.
Someone stay there as a caretaker.Nearby they would make
a pond...they will claim that those who take dip in the pond,
their problem of icthing will disappear. As it is most of the
people suffer from diseases, you will find many of them
reaching that spot. However, the water will becomes so
dirty that even a healthy man will catch some diesease but
the world does not take the truth; they take two dips, offer
money on the Samadhi and return home. Nobody does any
enquiry. Nobody tries to understand the game and advising
others to visit that place. People feel happy to make others
fool as themselves.This is the due to selfishness, we engage
in wrong Bhakti. In this way, hypocrites collect money. All
are entangled in these by the act of hypocrites. _'Khare
Sayane Sabhi Bhatkey, Teen Lok Mey Sabhi Atkey_ .'
The way I expose the working of hypocrites, no one
does. Every day cheating and deception goes on increasing.
Some as Tantrik, as Astrologers, as Sayana then some as
Priest and they loot the people. ....I have no conflict with
any Devi Devta, caste or creed. Devi Devata has got their


**80 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
own limitation in this bramhand, I am not against them.My
aim is to identify and warn people of hypocrites and tell
them that the Supreme lord is within , not somewhere
outside.
...Sahib and the Sants told us to keep away from the
group of hypocrites. They have destroyed big Panths.They
even do animal sacrifices and murders. They take an
innocent lamb for sacrifice, will not its mother cry! All
parents love their children. That is why I say," Do not do
such work". Slowly, hypocrites are also copying Sahib.
They also start to make banner of SATYA like us.Take
Sahibji's words also and write "Satguru veh Namah:" One
day, by surprise, they also may write Sahib Bandgi.
Remember, they will try to become like me. Then they will
put on Kurta-Paijama like me and claim that they are real
Sahib.Their goal is not bhakti. They have no good intention.
...they are interested in looting money...in any manner. Our
aim is to establish true devotion (Satya Bhakti)...not earning
money. The group of Hypocrites realizes that if Sahib
Bandgi org remains, it will damage their business.
Therefore, they are all joined to oppose Sahib Bandgi but it
will not succeed against the power of Satguru.
Kabir Sahibji has warned:
_Bin Janey Jo Nar Bhakti Karai|
So Naahi Bhav Sagar So Tarai||_
Before Kabir Sahib no one talked about this subject of
Kal Purush that why Kal Purush in the form of Mind
engaged in creation and desolution, Yug after Yug. The
entire world takes Jyotiswaroop Nirakar-Niranjan (Formless
Niranjan appearing as mass of light), the almighty lord-
Paramatma. Even all Ved and Puranas sing in his name as
creator-Alakh Purush. Kabir Sahib has clearly proved that
Jyoti Niranjan forced Adi-Kanya who brought the Hansas to
marry him. Therefore, they are vanished from Amarlok,
never to return. Now, Kal Purush in the form of Mind has
become the creator, the sustainer and the destroyer. In the


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **81**
form of Maya (Illusion) and Mother Nature (Prakruti),
Adishakti first created Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh (Trinities)
and made them as creators of worldly lives of beings.
The Vedas, which emanated from the breath of Kal
Niranjan, have merged in the Fishes Yoni (Aquatic Life
form-fish) because Brahma received Vedas through the
essence of breath (during churning of ocean). Therefore, in
the meditation on Brahma, Veda reveals as an illumination
of Chittakas-Akash in the chitt. Brahma could also know
only Jyotiswaroop-Nirakar as sung by the Veda in his
meditation. Brahma knew through Surti that it was Nirakar-
Niranjan was the creator and not Adyashakti.
First time frustrated by the man and other animals,
Earth-Prithvi went and complained to Vishnuji about its
plight in the form of a cow. Then Vishnuji with his Surti
meditated on Jyoti Niranjan and placed the issue before
him- "Oh Purush! Give solution." Kal Niranjan let out Shiva
and the fourteen Yamas and destroyed the creation of
Brahma and made Earth to be in its place. Then Agni-Fire
killed all the Jivas and sent them to Vishnu. Even the 33
crores of Gods were destroyed. This way destroying all the
Jivas, retained them with him. From the times of creation,
every day one lakh Jivas are given to Kal Niranjan to eat.
Just as the love of a farmer for his granary, Kal Purush has
love for Vishnu Bhagwan. Pleased with the Satvik nature of
Vishnu, Kal Niranjan gave his essence to him and made him
as a protector and supporter of creation. It is due to this
nature of Vishnu, Kal Niranjan made Brahmaji to arise from
Vishnu's navel in the subsequent creation. Due to the
Rajogunn (Active and Passionate) nature of Brahma, the
egg of trigunas (Hiranyagarbh) emerged through Pavan
from Vishnu's Navel and also Madhu-Kaitabh Daityas
(Demons) were born. Seven patal (lower worlds) and
watery world were born and as per the Satyug, living beings
are created. Eighty-Eight thousand Rishis, Nine Naths and
Eighty-Four lakhs Siddhas with them, Vishnu started


**82 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
Satyug. Kabir Sahib narrating the story of Hari to
Dharmadas made him a thorough seeker of the truth and
answering him further.
In the Satyug, Emperor Bali was the most powerful in
all the three worlds; Hell, Earth and Heaven. He gave
whatever people asked him, everyone returned happily to
him. Once, emperor Bali of Patal with the desire to become
the ruler of heaven with the help of his preceptor 'Shukra'
performed Ashwamedh Yagya (Sacrifice). Taking the form
of Vamana (Dwarf), Shri Vishnu Bhagwan arrived in the
place of Yagya in the Patal. Vishnu told Raja Bali- "Hearing
the greatness of your charitable nature, I have come to you.
I ask for that which I can measure with three steps of my
feet." Raja Bali thinking this as a meager, requested him to
ask for Gems and other valuables. Raja Bali did not
recognise the scheme of Sri Vishnu. Sri Vishnu with three
steps covered the three worlds and Bali. Vishnu took his
real form in front of Emperor Bali one of Dharma and
truthfulness. This way, the Satyug has ended in wickedness.
Likewise Kal Niranjan in every creation, dispenses fruit of
action, avenges, resist through the Avatars. In all the four
Yugas creation, sustenance and desolations happens in the
same way.
Explaining about Dharma of Salvation offered by
Niranjan, Sahib says that what Shri Hari has given fruit of
action and fruit of salvation, are in reality four types of
heavens which can be obtained by Sagun and Nirgun bhakti.
After consuming the end merits in the heaven, one has to
return to the womb of mother. Mind (Niranjan) mislead all
the people by giving the name of four different Muktis to
attain four types of heavens. Putting faith in these salvations
as permanent, all the Jivas are taking all kind of challenges.
Kabir Sahib has pulled out people from engaging in
activities intended for obtaining such temporary salvations.
It is only in the human body, Jivatmas can extricate from
delusion, with the Naam of Satguru.

When the Sanak-Sanandan reached the door of
Vaikunth, the doorkeepers, Jay-Vijay stopped them. Taking
this as an insult, those rishis cursed them to take life of
Daityas (Demonic beings) in the mortal world. Jay and
Vijay brought this to attention of Vishnu. Vishnuji called
Rishis inside and said that without a thought and enquiry,
you have cursed these two brothers. Therefore, you shall
take birth as their Daitya children in the mortal world and
obtain your release. This is the methodology made by
Kalniranjan for birth and death in the Vaikunth (Swarg) and
Earth. Jay and Vijay took birth as Daitya Kings
Hiranyakush and Hiranyakashapu in the world, they became
strong and powerful by worshipping and doing tapas on
Shivji. Hiranyakashpu's son Prahalad ignored the advice of
his Guru and ignoring the worship of Shiva and adored
Alakh Niranjan and other names of Shri Vishnu. Shri Hari
Vishnu killed Hiranyakashpu by taking the form of
Narasingha (Half-Lion, Half-Man), keeping him on his
thigh and using his nails as weapon tore him off. At the end,
Prahalad attained heavens' and became its King ‘Indra’.
Once, the king of heavens Indra performed a Yagya and
invited Siddha, Rishi, Gyaani, Gan-Gandharv and treated
them with food of their choice and served them. However,
the bell of the Yagna did not ring (as a indication of fruitful
completion). Narad contemplated on the reason and said
that Rishi Jamdagni has overcome his desires. He said- The
bell will only ring if his meditation is interrupted or he
engages in sexual pleasure (Rati kriya). By the marriage to
the daughter of King Kashyap, Jamdagni created Bhrugu
lineage (kul). In the Treta Yuga, Rama has identified
Parshurama, Vishnu's incarnation as of Bhrugukul. King
Dashrath while on hunting accidentally killed Shravan
Kumar. Therefore, Shravan Kumar's parents cursed him
saying that in the end his death will be due to separation of
his son. Rama has taken birth in his house due to this curse.


**84 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
When Rama left for the forest to spend 14 years, his
separation has caused agony and death of King Dashrath.
The story of incarnation of Vishnu is full of such
incidents. Dispensing the Fruit of action, taking every
intervention and revenge are play of the Avatars. Raja
Daksh had invited all the Devas, Rishis and Kings but he
did not invite his Son-in-law (Shivji). Parwati developed
Desire to see the Yagya done by her Father. On her own,
convinced and took Shivji along with her. Raja Daksh said
that it was an insult to his dynasty that Sati has married
Shivji therefore, he said they are not welcomed. With rage,
Sati jumped into the Yagya fire and gave up her life. There
was an uproar from all those who were present and the
Yagya was ruined. Shivji full of anger, took the half burnt
body of Sati and went around with rage to destroy the
world. Parvati's body parts fell at 52 different places, which
are all called Shaktipeeths. After this, Sati took the birth as
Parvati in the house of King of Himalaya. Vishnuji thought,
to bring out Shivji from the state of dejection and decided
that only Kamagni (Flame of Lust) can achieve it. To this
end, Vishnuji sent Kamdev and Rati to Shivji.
Brahmagyani Brahma's son Naradmuni and Parashar
Rishi could not escape from flame of lust. Rishi Parashar
watching Machhodari (A fisherman's daughter) crossing the
river on a boat became lustful and forcefully married her.
Vishnu thinking about it, planned to marry off Parvati to
Shivji. Looking at the Parvati in the house of King,
Naradmuni's Mind swang and he approached Vishnu asked
for a beautiful form. Vishnuji to protect Naradmuni's state
of celibacy gave him a face of Monkey. When Parvati
showed him a mirror, he became angry and returned to
Vishnu and then Vishnu reminded him of Sati who gave her
life in the Yagna-Kund then Narad realised his mistake.
Holding on to Vishnu's feet, he asked for forgiveness and
prayed for the form of a Human.


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **85**
Giving all these stories of those incidents and the proof
to Dharmadas, Kabir Sahib answered his queries and gave
him wisdom of truth and said, merging in the Param Purush
of Satlok meaning attaining our true home, Hansas are free
from the illusionary worlds of Kal Purush. While telling the
worldly people, Kabir Sahib said that in the Amarlok there
is no Karma, Bondage of Karma and Consequence of
action, no opposition or revenge of Avatars and there is
neighter Hell nor Heaven, no sport or Leela of Kal Niranjan.
In the Amarlok, there are no Kalp, Yuga or end of Yugas,
there is neither a country, nor Sun and Moon, there is no
Galaxies or Skies, there is neither creation nor a dissolution.
On reaching Satlok, Atma becomes eternal ocean of bliss.
There, formless Mind Niranjan cannot remain.
Unable to Bear the burden, the Earth went to Vishnu and
prayed to him then Vishnu absorbed all within himself.
From that time, Vishnu's Satyug started. Kabir Sahib
disclosed about the 14 Yugas which took place before
Vishnu's first Satyug. (1)Aghasur Yug, (2) Balbhadra Yug,
(3) Dwandar Yug, (4) Poorvan Yug, (5) Anumaan Yug,
(6)Dhiryamaal Yug, (7)Taaran Yug, (8)Akhil Yug,

looking at the deep inquisitiveness of Dharmadas narrated
the four Yugas- Satya, Treta, Dwapar and Kaliyugas. Sahib
appeared in each Yuga under different names and spread the
glory of Satya Naam.

Creation of this Mind has expansion without end or
limit. All the creation are of Mind. In the creation of Life,
there are seven types- Humans, Devas, Snakes (Naag),
Kinnar (Angels), Animals, Birds and Ghosts. Kabir Sahib
has cautioned that it is Mind which is Gorakhnath (Yogi),
Mind is Govind (God), Mind is the Mendicants, it engages
all humans in actions (Karma). Bound to the Mind, Man
thinks that he is the doer. Mind destroys like small insects,
by filling all the time with the fleeting pleasures. Taking a
Human form, due to the Mind they are unable to grasp and
experience the Naam of Satguru. This Mind takes you up
above the sky by making you a Bird and it makes you fall
and takes you to Maya. Therefore, do not engage in action
as per the promptings of your Mind. Keep the body under
control and let the Mind wander. Control of senses will
make the Mind fall like a bow from the hand. When the
bow has fallen then the arrow of Mind and the bow of body
cannot do anything. An individual who is free from Mind

can follow true path meaning it can attain the form of Atma
at the feet of Satguru.

To control the Mind and senses, avoid intoxicants, meat
and other forbidden foods. Consuming such food is against
the Atmic awareness. All these are filthy still Mind
encourages to indulge. All Jivas are filled with dirt of Body,
fecal matter and urine. All the four categories of Lifeforms
develop from dirt and water only. The body's dirt or
cleanliness can be observed only when we wash it with
water. All creatures develop from the dirt, feeding on them
results in only ignorance. Those fruits, vegetables, etc.
which grows out of soil and water should only be consumed
to appease the hunger. The pains of Humans, Animals and
Birds are same. Those Humans, Animals and Birds who
consumes flesh or meat, can never be a protector of Jivas,
Mind has absolute control over such beings. Therefore,
Non-vegetarians (eggs included) because of lack of
compassion and cruelty, degrade into the birth of lower life
forms. They suffer in Hell. To eat the flesh, many innocent
beings are killed. By taking the lives of beings and causing
pain to them, they prepare their future lives themselves to
reap the consequences. The company of Non-vegetarians
and alcoholics strengthens the influence of Mind. Such
association will become a hindrance on the path of Atmic
awareness. Kabir sahibji has warned that whosoever throats


**88 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
you cut and whose flesh you eat, without fail, they will cut
your throat.

It is said- Flesh eater should be taken as Demonic. Death

Parampurush is the father of all, whom he will not take as
his child? Do not cause harm or kill any being even by
default. Such a hypocrite cannot be a dear to any God- Ram,
there is no doubt about it. Sahib says-

Goswami Tulsidas said- ' _Shruti Puran Kahe Upaai,
Chhutey Na Adhikh Adhikh Aruzaai|_ ' Ved is created by
Niranjan and he has taken the form of Mind, he has shown
the art of savior. Because of this reason, even big Rishi-
Munis, could not comprehend this secret. Even today, you
may be listening to discourses of many Mahatma on TVs
that they talk on Sargun and Nirgun Bhakti. Some show
Bhakti of one and others to others. To whichever Devi-
Devtas Bhakti they propagate, they will claim that they are
on the way to Mukti. To these Mahatmas all are same. They
take troublesome Niranjan Bhagwan as a savior and friend.
Param Purush broke Niranjan's channel of Surti because
of his evil deeds and for putting the Jivas in bondage and
torturing them. He was cursed that he won't be able to
meditate on Param Purush and will never return to Amarlok.
Param Purush thought of putting an end to him. However
because, he has given him Seventeen Chaukdi Asankhya
(10^27 ) Yugas. He thought that if he finishes him, his word
will not be fulfilled. Therefore, he did not finish him but
cursed him saying- "Your stomach will not be filled even if
you swallow one lakh Jivas everday." That is why, Mind-
Niranjan do not have peace in day and night, remains active,
Mind arousing desires in all and makes them dance.
Restless Mind is neither gets satisfied nor finds fulfillment.
For ages (Yugas), Jivas are under the clutches of
Niranjan and Adishakti. Sahib while describing the Mind
said again:
_Swarg Patal Mrutyu Mandal Rachi, Teen Lok Vistara||
Harihar Brahma Ko Pragatayo, Tinhey Diyo Shir Bhara|
Thav Thav Tirath Rachi Rakhyo, Thagve Ko Sansara||
Chaurasi Bich Jeev Phasavey, Kabahu na hoy Ubara||
Jaari Baari Bhasmi Kari Darey, Phiri Devey Autara||
Avagaman Rahe Urzavey, Borey Bhav Ki Dhara||
Satguru Shabd Bina Chinhey, Kaisey Utarey Paara||

_Jasey Miley Akhand Moksh Sukh, Marag Hey Nyara||
Kal Jaal Se Bancha Chaho, Gaho Shabdh Tatt Saara|
Kahahi Kabir Amar Kari Rakho, Jo Parakho Taksara||
'Thav Thav Tirath Rachi Rakhyo, Thagvey Ko Sansara|'_
Think about what is been said. Niranjan has created place of
holy pilgrimage to deceive the world and entangle in them
so that they will not find their way to the truth. This is the
hidden secrete, enquire deeply into it. Then _'Maya Phaans
Phansay Jiv Sab, Aap Baney Kartara| Satguru Sharan Jo
Amarlok Hey, Tako Mundo Dwara||_ ' Niranjan has bound
everyone in Maya and taken up his seat as the invisible lord.
He has closed the path to the true home of Hans Atma,
Amarlok. Mind never allows taking the shelter of Satguru
easily. Rules, Righteous conduct (Dharma), Yagya,
Penance,etc are the business of these three worlds, he keeps
people entangled in them. The path of salvation is very
different; one attains it only at the feet of Satguru.
_'Man Ko Koi Dekh Na Paye, Nana Rang Dikhaye|'_
Mind is seated in deep dark spot, no one can see. The
day one grasp the real form of Mind, the whole world will
appear different. Generally, I don't find any intelligent
people, it is because people don't see the inner network.
Everybody is engaged in fulfilling the desires of Mind.
_'Man Murid Sansar Hey, Guru Murid Koi Ek|'_ Those who
follow the delusions of others will never be intelligent.
Mind always lead you on the path of disaster.It is said-
_Man Hi Ahey Kal Karala| Jiv Nachaye Karey Behala||
Jiv Ke Sang Man Kal Rahai| Agyaani Nar Janat Naahi||_
Atma has no necessity to steal, no need to be fraudulent
or wicked. All these are impact of the body. All that which
is done by the Mind are on account of body. Man performs
action by the prompting of Mind. For the welfare and
fulfillment of body, Mind engages men in all kind of
activities. When its requirements are not met, Mind involves
human in bad actions. If its need are fulfilled, he may
perform some good deeds. Mind will never permit man to


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **91**
work for the benefit of Atma, under any circumstances, it
will drag only towards materialistic world.
Therefore Sahibji says-
_'Tera bairi koi nahi, tera baieri man|'_ Mind is the
hinderance for attaining Atmic awareness. Atma takes to the
direction of Mind. Knowledge will be of no use at the time
of death. I am not against the education. However, if you
think with the worldly knowledge that you can attain Atmic
awareness, it is not possible. Dayanand Saraswatiji went to
Virjanand Saraswatiji and knocked the door from outside.
Virjananji asked- "Who is that?" Dayanand Saraswatiji
replied- "I have come to know only that." Then Virjanandji
replied- "Throw away all your bookish knowledge outside
and then only enter. Books will be of no use in the
realisation of Atma." In Atma, the needle of Mind is stuck;
it is enough if you remove this needle of Mind out.
Mind is misusing Atma. Everyone has a concentration in
him, Mind entangled this concentration in externals. First,
the boy loves the mother, if mother is not around the boy
cries because his concentration on his mother. He
understands with the touch feeling that she is his mother.
When he grows up a little, his concentration is on play.
Wherever you remain concentrated, there you will find
pleasure. When he is concentrated on his play, he will not
respond for his mother's call because his concentration is
away from his mother. When he becomes a youth, his
concentration would be on studies. They study up to the
midnight and get up at 4am in the morning. Concentration is
on studies. After marriage, his concentration will be on
sexual pleasure. Concentrating on anything other than Guru
is not beneficial, a loss. However, the whole life
concentration is only on worldly things. The truth is bliss is
inside the concentration but people search for it in the
externals. It is similar to the Musk Deer searching for the
Musk (Kasturi) outside all the time in the bushes and plants,


**92 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
it wastes all his life like this, while the Musk is in its navel
all the time.
Your thought, your decision, your desire all are under
the influence of Mind. Mind is not in your control. Then
how can you be intelligent!

Paramatma (Over Lord of the universe) in formless
Mind has filled individual with Satanic treasure, there is no
space left for Param Purush to take his seat (The eternal
Lord Supreme). Sexual desire having arrow of -Maran
(ready to kill anyone for the sake of sex), Maaran (ready to
end of ownself for the sake of sex). Vashikaran (ready to
follow any order of woman for the sake of sex). Mohan
(think always about some particular lady and forget all his
duties). Uchhatan (for particular lady take enimity with all)
has affected the thought process of all. In the family of
Kaam, his wife is Rati (sexual bodily act),his son is Lalach
(covetousness), Lolupata (always thinking for sensual
pleasure), this family entangled everyone. In the family of
Anger, Hinsa (violence) is his wife, Avichaar
(indiscrimination) is his son,Bhul (mistakes) is his daughter,
this whole family is the main cause of disaster of this world.
Lobh (Greed) also has his own family,Trushna (thirst) is his
wife and Sin is his son, it means Lobh is father of every Sin.
Moh (Attachment) also resides in this body and Trushna
(thirst),Ichha (desire), Lalach (covetousness), Pakhand

respectively.Then Ahankar (Ego) is also becomes
undividable part of personality, it resides with it’s wife


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **93**
Ninda (denouncement). With the hands of this five families
Mind twisted everyone. For that Sahibji alerts------
_Chashme Dil Se Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashe Ho Rahe_
In this Niranjan’s creation, condition of Hansa (Once
upon a time it was a part of Parampurush) becomes very
worst. In the religious literature, many Rishies(monk)
describe don’t know how and whom leela is this.All are
agreed that our body is a gift, given by Paramatma.But we
have failed to understand that who is a real Paramatma.
Paramatma is a name of Kaal itself, he is the Mind, he gives
birth and he only gives the death. He gives lot of sufferings
and he is the destroyer, then how he becomes our Sahib.No,
it’s not possible. Sahib itself is a mokshdham (where the
Soul is free from all kinds of sufferings).
Many times, due to compulsion, real saint also also use
the word “Paramatma”, because worldly people takes Param
Purush as Paramatma and Paramatma as a Sahib (these are
two different terms, Param Purush means Sahib and
Paramatma means Kaal).
This confusion happens because people don’t get real
knowledge of Sahib (Satyapurush).We have to clear this
confusion. Saint always talking about two different Purush--

- one is Satyapurush (Sahib) and another is Kal Purush
(Paramatma, Niranjan) more details are as follows ----
    1. Names of Satyapurush : Param Purush, Satya Purush,
Avinashi Purush and Sahib.
    2.Names of Nirakar Niranjan : Alakh Niranjan,
Nirankar, Narayan etc. Worldly people knows him as Ram,
Rahim, Kadar, Kareem, Omkar, Parameshwar, Paramatma,
Hari, Adwait, Bhagwan,Brahma etc. In religious scripture
there are thousands names of Kal-Niranjan.
    In actual Vedas contains thousands names of Kal
Purush.But common people does not know it.They assumes
that Paramatma and Kal Purush are two different things, but
in reality this two names are of only one thing.


**94 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
For easy understanding of common people,saint has
mostly used word Paramatma for Sahib. As burd knows
other burd of it’s type, dog knows other dog of it’s type
similarly Saint (who are merged with Param Purush) has
also takes a human form to reveal the truth to worldly
people. For that they have to suffer a bodily pain and they
have to face lot of troubles created by their opponents. A
human who posses a body which is a creation of Kal
Purush,can only understand the teaching of other person
who is in human form. Saint has use the word Ram for the
sake of understanding of the people, but people assumes
that Saint are also talking about that Ram who was son of
Dasharath. No, to clarify this confusion Saint clearly states -
----
_Jag Me Charo Ram Hai, Teen Ram Vyavahar|
Chautha Ram Nijsaar Hai,Taka Karo Vichar||
Ek Ram Dasharath Ghar Dole, Ek Ram Ghat Me Bole||
Ek Ram Ka Sakal Pasara,Ek Ram Tribhuvan Te Nyara||
Sakar Ram Dasharath Ghar Dole, Nirakar Ghat Me Bole| Bindu
Ram Ka Sakal Pasara, Niralamba Ram Sab Hi Te Nyara_ ||
He is Lord of this three lok, whole universe is his
creation only, he himself arrest the soul by putting it in this
bodily cage and gives lot of sufferings. Here even Devata is
also not happy, then how rest of others will become happy.
_Sur Nar Muni Aru Devata, Saat Dip Nav Khand|
Kahe Kabir Sab Bhogiya, Deh Dhare Ka Dand||_
Religious leaders of all religion in this world has not let out
even saints, they gave lot of pain to them_._ This is the
Niranjan’s play of Dharmajaal. Therefore the saints have
said-
First Ram: Son of Dashrath [whose story is mentioned in
Ramayan and Ramcharitmanas.
Second Ram: who is described as the formless lord (Nirakar
Niranjan), etc.
Third Ram: Is the form of sperm, which is the basis of
offsprings.


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **95**
Fourth Ram: Niralamb Ram who is Param Purush.(Kabir
Sahib and other real saints described about him.)
The forth Ram is beyond the three worlds and its seven
skies of Brahmand, the seven great inner skies. The form
and formless is upto the three worlds. The worldly people
take worship of the formless God-Nirakar as the highest.
However, Nirakar is Paramtama but he is not satyapurush.
The whole mankind has taken Nirakar-formless god as
paramatma and concentrate on it (Anurukt). Sahib Satya
Purush is the radiance of Soundless Sound but not, the light.
The Sound of Paramatma is illusion. They call Atma and
Paramatma. The word Atma is also illusion. The Sant has
refered to the Supreme power as Sahib and similarly, the
entities of his essence as Hansa. The Maha Purush also had
the appealiation ‘Paramhans’ with their names. The power
of awareness manifest, then it is refered to as Hansa. There
is no disturbance in quality between a Hansa and Param
Purush. That is why, Hans becomes Paramhans. The one
who has the power of awareness, it is called a Hans. When
the awareness of Hansa reaches and merges in the Surti of
Sahib (Chetan angh) with the grace of Sant Satguru, and
returns for the welfare of Jeevas, then it is refered as
Paramhans or Sant Satguru. He stays in the world free from
the influence of Kalpurush. Whenever they wish, they can
detach from body, life breath, and Mind. Living in this
world, they are free, and free others from the grip of Kal
Purush.
When the Hansas associate with the Mind, it is called
Atma, when the life force joins them, it is called Jiva
(Hansa, Hansa+Mind=Atma, Atma +Life breath= Jiva). The
life breath which enters the Jiva becomes ten Life forces:
(1) Apan, (2) Udan, (3) Saman, (4) Pran, (5) Sarvatan
Vyam, (6) Nag, (7) Dhananjay, (8) Kirkil, (9) Jambhai and
(10) Devdat; these are the important Life forces. Niranjan
has arrested every jiva by the chain of this ten life forces in
to the body and indulged it in Maya (attachment).Therefore


**96 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
they are called Jivatma. Apan Vayu is at the Anal passage
which helps to excrete faecal matter. Udan Vayu is in the
place of liver. Saman Vayu activates the entire physical
action of the body. Pran Vayu is seated at the heart.
Sarvatan Vyam Vayu pervades the entire body. Nag Vayu
strengthens the neck. Dhananjay Vayu gives strength to
arms and shoulder. Kirkil Vayu does the balancing of all the
other Vayus just like a traffic controller. Jambhai Vayu
removes the Laziness and reduces the effect of heat. Devdat
Vayu gives protection to the eye, with the movement of
eyelid. This way, when the Hans of Param Purush joins the
Mind Niranjan, it becomes Atma and when the life force
joins these, it is called Jiva. The Jiva entering the material
body pervades even every hair of it. The essence of
Niranjan are called Jivas. This way, the Hansas are bound in
Maya. If the Mind-Niranjan did not enter the Hansa, it
would not have been imprisoned in the body. If the Hansas
were not trapped in the bodies, they would leave to reach
Param Purush, because they are Sahib’s Hansas. The Mind
form Niranjan gave the body to Adishakti in the form of
Maya. This act of Niranjan was against the wish of Param
Purush. Sahib has sent the Hansas, with Adishakti to
handover it to Niranjan on condition, that status of Hansas
will be same as in Mansarovar.
Niranjan Mind+Atma+Pran=Jeev all are unitedly gets
changes in different types of bodies. This is a fixed process,
by which Adhibhautik (Materialistic) and Adhidaivik
(Divine forces) creation gets expand. The Vedic Scholars
and Gurus take this as basis of Paramatma and Spirituality,
take Mind as basis for wisdom and take Pranna (Life force)
as source of action and take the Matter as a basis for speech.
The vedic scholars take Life force (Pranvan padarth) as Satt
and refer the form of auxillary Pranas (Life force) as Deities
or Demi gods.
The Sants refers to that Atma which attains awareness
and reaches Satlok is called as Hansa. With the grace of


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **97**
Satguru, attaining awareness, it merges in Satya Purush.
When Hansa returns from Satlok to the three Lokas, with
the essence form of Satyapurush, it is refered to as
Paramhans or Satguru. Classes of Vedic Gurus who take
Nirakar Niranjan as their very lifebreath are called Rishis.
The Sants have described the existence of ten pranas-life
forces in the body, whereas the Vedic scholars have
mentioned about the working of seven subtle Pranas in-
group. As per their findings, from the five subtle bodies
(Panch Kosh) to Atma; there exists five dwelling places of
forces (Guhas). In the body, there are four Guhas; in every
Guha there are seven sub Pranas active in seven parts. In the
seven parts, there are three sets of negative (Runatmic) and
positive (Dhanatmic) forms and the seventh one is
independent.
(1)Siroguha-Head: contains two ears, two eyes and two
nostrils which constitutes six Pranas and the seventh is the
mouth which is single. All these senses are activated by
seven Pranas (life forces) and centered at mouth, together it
is called Indra. Saints have called the mouth as sense organ.
(2)Uroguha-Upper Torso: It contains two hands, two lungs,
two sides of the breast and the seventh is the single heart.
(3)Udar Guha-Abdomen to legs: It contains spleen,
stomach, large intestine and small intestine, two kidneys
together becomes six and the seventh is the navel. They are
all centered at heart. It helps to digest food and assimilate it
to the body.
(4) Vastiguha-Lower part: It contains two legs, urinary tract
and sperm or overy tracts, two overies or testecles and an
anus. The seven Pranic forces for these are centered at
navel. Vastiguha helps in excretary functions of the body.
While describing the four groups of Pranas of the body
created by Kal Niranjan, the Vedic Gurus also refers to the
four classes of Varnas of human body. Siroguha which
constitutes organs of perception-Gyan as Brahmin. Uroguha
which forms the part of armor is refered to as Kshatriya.


**98 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
Udarguha which supports and sustains to body is refered to
as Vaishya. Vastiguha with its skills and services are refered
to as Shudra. As per the above functions, the Pranic Forces
powers their activities part by part, their forms and activities
are separate. Mind in the form of Bharadwaj Rishi counsels
(Waj) meaning, counsel through support (Bharan) is known
as Bharadwaj. Eye is refered as Jamadagni with which we
can see and perceive the world. The illumination of light is
Agni, Jamadagni. The ear, which becomes Vishwamitra is
Vishwamitra Rishi. The speech that is translated into
worldly action becomes Vishwakarma. Those important
activities carried out by Pranas in the body are refered to as
Pitra, Dev or Asur or Demonic Praan. Further, beyond this
there are engaged, eight vasus (Lords of eight directions),
eleven Rudras and twelve Adityas with them. One Indra and
Prajapati together they consitute thirty-three Praan Devtas.
Its expansion is considered as the thirty- three crores of
Gods.
Sants have called the above descriptions of Shastras and
function of Human body as Delution (Maya Jaal) of Kal
Niranjan. This Jiva is the creation of Niranjan who are in
ignorant. This is opposed to Satya and Amarlok. In this
state, the Mind form Niranjan himself is the Praan whom
the Shastra Gurus call as Paramatma. Amarlok is free from
such creations, expansion and desolution. The Mind form
Niranjan's expansion of three worlds are based on
destructive elements. Sahib and Sants have exposed the
game of kal niranjan on Jiva and Praan. Sahib says:
_Santo Sabka Sakshi Mera Saai|
Brahma, Vishnu, Rudra, Ishwar Le Sab Jag Pragatai||_
It means in all these Paramatma is creator of this world
and existed in this world only.
The Param Purush of Satlok has no role in this Mind,
Atma, Praan, Jiv and modes of creation, expansion,
contraction and desolution. Param Purush sends Satguru to
free his Hansas from this condition.

Therefore, the Sant Dadu dayal says in praise of Kabir
sahib---
_Dadu Naam Kabir Ka, Jo Koi Leve Ott|
Usko Kabhu Na Lagti, Kal Purush Ki Chott||_
Those who take refuge at the feet of Satguru, will not
face any problem from Kal Purush; freeing from Niranjan's
world forever with the devotion to Satguru, they merge with
the blissful world of Satpurush.
High born Sant Dadu Dayalji, Great Poet Jayasi etc, they
were not after good and attractive look but were true and
nobel souls of Paramatma Purush. Worldly people are
attracted towards Mahatmas who are Hrushta (Prosperous)-
Pushta (Strong)-Sudol (Good looking) and connected with
material positions and take them as one who attain
Adhyatmic Shaktis. Such Gurus even display artistic skills
in delievering the sermons and people in the name of
religion reach them in millions. People take them as
Scholars well-versed in the art of delinating scriptures,
eloquent narration on life of Avatars and spiritually evolved
and flock them in large numbers. To keep people away from
Satya and rightousness of spirit (Atma Dharm), Kal
Niranjan has created different Religions, Monastries or
Matts and Pilgrimage places. Ordinary people are unable to
recognize the truth of those Dharmas. Niranjan's play of
miracles and Maya and became Bhagwan for ordinary
people. The one who reaches a Real Guru will find Supreme
Lord in his Satguru himself. The Disciple of Gurucharandas
Sahajo bai rejected and described the Bhagwan in the form
of Hari. Sahajo Bai sings pleading-
_Hari Ko Taju Guru Ko Na Bisaru|Guru Ke Sam Hari Ko Na

Hari Ne Janm Diyo Jag Mahi|Guru Ne Avagaman Chhudaai||
Hari Ne Panch Chor Diye Satha|GuruNe Lai Chhudai Anatha||

**100 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
_Charandas Par Tann Mann Vaaru|Guru Na Taju Hari Ko Taj

What a spontaneous pray from Sahajo Bai, says “I can
leave God but I can’t leave my Guru. I don’t want to see
God even in the presence of my Guru. God threw me in
the worldly ocean but it is my Guru who saved me from it.
God had sent along with me five thieves like lust,envy,
pride,greed, anger etc. but my guru freed me from their grip
as well. Further, God had entangled me in the net of family
of Caste-Color-Class-Linage, but my Guru freed me from
this network of attachment. Hari has entangled us in
enjoyment and sufferings, from which our Guru has
liberated us. Not only these, that Paramatma has entangled
us in action and delusion.Whereas Guru freed us from the
delusion and showed our Atma to us. This way, entangling
everyone, Paramatma Niranjan disappeared and hide
himself , however my Guru lit the light of Atmic wisdom
which helped us to see the reality around us. As such I can’t
leave the company of my Guru even if I have to forget all
about God.” Infact, a Satguru has been accorded a high
status simply because it is through his medium alone that
we can realise Parampurush.
Brothers! It is only a disciple of Satguru who can
comprehend Niranjan because he doesn't entangle himself
in the scriptural knowlege. True wisdom lies above and
beyond the words of scripture, it is an act of simple
surrender.
_Man Hi Sarupi Dev Niranjan, Tohi Raha Bharmai|\
Panch Pachees Teen Ko Pinjda, Jamey Tohi Rakha Bharmai||_
Sant Dadu Dayal says that in this world Niranjan has
spread his net in each and every place. Niranjan stays on
every Jiva and men's head with a resolve. Even then people
are immersed in blind persuits, they are still unaware.
_Jaha Jaha Dadu Pag Dharey,Taha Kaal Ka Phand|
Sirr Upar Sadhey Khada, Ajhu Na Chete Andh||_


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **101**
Sahib has disclosed that the Mind Niranjan takes the
form of different Avatars and entangles Sur (Demons), Nar
(Men) and Muni (Sages). Only those who escape from this,
leaves the three world to reach the eternal world Amarlok.
Thrown out from the Manasarovar of Amarlok due to
misdeeds, Niranjan has created three worlds-Earth, Hell and
Heaven and became his Paramatma-Kal Niranjan. Making
Atma out of Hans and Jivas out of Atma; Niranjan in the
form of Mind-Pran has created actions of Sins and merit and
entangled all the Jivas with it.
_Paap Punya Rachi Jiv Fasaya|Jo Jas Kare So Tas Fal Paya||
Kare Pap Tehi Narak Bhugtai|Kare Punya Tehi Swarg Pathai||_
As per the dispensation of Action and consequences,
Bad karmas- Sinful deeds takes one to the hell and the
heaven is given for meritarious deeds. To reap the
consequences of deeds, one takes the womb of the mother
repeatedly. With this dispensation, Kal Purush is entangling
Jivas from the beginning of creation.
_Karmahi Bhugti Garabh Mey Javey|Yahi Vidhi Kal Jiv
Fandavey||_
The play of Hell and heaven is heartning. For the fear of
Hell, Man restrains from sinful deeds, and due to Lust and
attraction of heaven, he gets stuck in good deeds. The one
who stays away from sinful deed, he is good all right.
However, engaged in Karma, he keeps himself away from
attaining Mukti, which is his goal. The goal of Atma is not
attainment of Heaven.
In Dwapar yug, at the end of Mahabharath war, Vasudev
Krishna told the five Pandavas that they killed their
kingmen and relatives in the war. Therefore, to metigate the
misfortunes, he suggested that they should perform Yagya.
Yudhishthir replied saying that it was you, Krishna who
claimed that you are the doer and cause of all and we are
only a medium. Krishna said that it was the duty and
responsibility of the Pandavas however, killing members of
your lineage is a terrible sin. Therefore, Yagya is very


**102 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
important. To escape from the terrible hell and for peaceful
life, you should perform Yagya, said Krishna.
The three world’s Niranjan has arranged the time in Hell
and Heaven as the consequences. The quality and
magnitude of sin commited determines the time spent in a
particular Hell. How much good deed performed in life
time, Heaven is offered in that proportion only.One has to
take Birth repeatedly in this mortal world. After spending a
long time in the Hell, one takes Birth in the 84 Lakhs of
jivas and suffers agonisingly. After spending time in the
enjoyment of Heaven, one takes birth as a Human being for
the welfare of his Atma. With the desire of attaining heaven,
one performes good deeds and after spending time in the
heaven, he again takes Human birth and entangles himself
in deeds. To take birth itself is a painful affair. The womb of
the mother is a painful place like hell itself and it is a place
of fecal matter and urine. We should be free from this.
Everyone wants to free himself from ocean of life
(Bhavsagar). However, after performing meritarious deeds,
one is able to attain only some heaven. Finally, what
happens.
In reality, Atma has to attain Amarlok which is it's true
home. Reaching there, one does not return to womb of a
mother. If one finds a Satguru and engages in devotion and
service to him, then he sure to attain Amarlok. Worldly
people forget this. They perform good deeds but they do not
take refuge at the feet of Satguru. They do not take a guru,
even if they seek a Guru, it is only for the worldly benifits.
This is the biggest negligence on their part. Remember,
after taking Human birth, do not waste your life without a
real and complete Satguru, never forget this.
With the devotion, Yog and Dhyaan to Alakh Niranjan,
Yogis, Rishis and Avtars receive all types of Siddhis,
Niddhi, Aishwarya and dominion.

One who has all the Ashta-Siddhi and Nav Nidhi and six
forms of wealth (Shadeshwar) Aishwariyas, Virya, Yash,
Shree, Gyan, Vairagya is refered to as Bhagawan. In this
way Brahma or Ishwar who has 'Shadeshwar-Sampann' is
called Bhagawan. These miraculous powers are the basis of
Niranjan's creative process in which Nature and life forms
are full of wonders. If a Yogi, men of penance or a Devotee
receives one or more powers, they manifest it as miracles,
super human feats. Looking at such super natural display,
people take them to be redeemer or giver of salvation. Some
Baba-Oza-Janiya etc imitate such miracles with the aid of
Magic and materials, cheat, loot, deceive worldly people,
because of this display of Niranjan's miracles, worldly
people are swayed away from true salvation-Satya Moksh.
Avatar and Mahapurushas who posses such a super
natural power of the formless Mind-Nirakaar, becomes the
basis of authoring scriptural doctrines of various religions.
Just as-

1. Yahudi-Judaism's holy book is Torah.
2. Bouddha-Buddhist's holy book is Tripitika.
3. Jain-Jainism's holy book is Agama.
4. Isai-Christanity's holy book is Bible.
5. Islam's holy book is Quran.
6. Sikh-Sikhism's holy book is Adi Granth.
7. Parsi-Zorastrian's holy book is Zend Avesta.
8. Hindu-Hinduism's holy book is based on the famous
Shruti Veda.
However, with time, from the holy books of various
Mahapurushas their followers made various sects, divisions
and Matts. In India, those who do not accept the four Vedas


**104 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
have made Charvak, Buddhist, Jain and Shakth and their
division and subdivisions.
In the mortal world of Kal Purush, there is no other
source other than the complicated and contradicting
scriptures on philosophy of Dharma. Highlighting the
pitfalls of those philosophies, Kabir Sahib has given true
Adhyatmic Wisdom. His words brought out the inherent
limitations of the worldly Dharmas and its blind worship-
_Teerat Gaye Dou Jana, Chitt Chanchal Man Chor|
Eko Paap Na Katiya, Ladey Das Man Aur||_
People are prompted by the Chitt to undertake
Pilgrimages along with the wicked Mind. None obtains any
benefit by this act, on the contraryit multipliese problems
more than ten times due to perversive Mind.

Three physical sins: Stealing, Violence, Immorality
Three sins of word: Abuse, Accusition and Lies
Four mental sins: Hatred, Jealousy, Pride and Wickedness.
All these ten constitute sins of the Mind.
Just as the Bee attracted by the fragrance of the Lotus,
gives up his life when the flower petal closes; just as fish
loses its life for the taste of his tongue; an elephant is caught
due to its infactuation to cow elephant; just as the Moth
gives up his life enchanted by light of the lamp and just as a
Musk deer attracted by the sound of the flute. Similarly,
Niranjan trapped the Jivas with Birth, Death and Karma by
the strenght of Kam (desire), Krodh (anger), Lobh (greed),
Moh (attachment), Ahankar (Ego) of Mind.

## 8. FORMLESS –WITHIN FORM BOTH

## ARE MIND ONLY

People by utilising their worldly intellect and Viveka,
became very strong. This creative knowledge and worldly
knowledge of destruction ( **Bhautik shakti** ) makes Human
unique among living beings. In truth, the body is Narayani
chola (Field of Action). Even the Devas and Gods desires to
take this Human body. It is not without reason, it is said that
getting a Human body is rare. Niranjan has given a great
deal of powers to the Human, it is his crown of creation.
Niranjan's divine powers are potent in Human. In the
elements as well as awareness of elements, Human have a
great deal of Strength. If you look at the world of creation,
other beings have not created anything. The physical power
of Human is unique, huge Skyscrapper buldings, Space
Ship, T.V, Computer, Cellphone, Telephone, these are the
creative skills. Atomic bomb and Fighter jets, Submarine,
Warship and such destructive creation. Such a creative
skills are in plenty.
Brothers! Human have another power with them i.e
**Adhyatmic Shakti- Spiritual power**. Niranjan's **divine
power** is also present in Human body. The Divine powers
that are present in the body cannot be experienced with
Sense organs. Everyone has that unique divine power, with
that Man can accomplish great things. Today, Human has
advanced in materialistic achievements but in the field of
Yoga and Spirituality, they are still backward. There was a
time that in India people had very advance knowledge on
Human body. Dhrutarashtra seated in Hastinapur (Delhi),
come to know the Mahabharata war-in Kuruskhetra in real
time through Sanjay. It is not an ordinary matter, neither he
had a Tower, a T.V nor a Network. Even then seated with
Dhrutarashtra at Hastinapur, Sanjay gave a clear and precise
narration of war at Kuruskhetra as it happened. We can


**106 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
imagine the level of divine wisdom and the knowledge of
inner power existed in India at that time.
Come let us see what this **Divine Power** is. This Divine
power is not only with the selected people, infact it is with
everyone. The human body is the source of these Divine
Powers. Then why is that people does not know? You do
not get these powers easily. When the inner power centers
are activated with efforts, then Niranjan himself will let
them manifest them in you. With the manifestation of these
power centers, one will be able to see the three times (Past,
Present and Future) and understand. One can see the events
taking place in the creation with the divine power. When
these powers manifests in oneself, he can travel to any place
in this universe. One can attain these divine power with
Niranjan's Trigun Bhakti (Tamas-Rajas-Satva), Yoga of
Penance-meditation.
Whatever exists in these three worlds also exists in this
human body. The creation of Human Body and this
Universe are similar. Both are made out of the five
elements. The Universe dissolves and destroys, the body
also perishes and dissolves. The Atma which is under the
spell of Nirakar Niranjan and embodied in attachment is
eternal and free from the elements. Kalniranjan is ever
engaged in ruling over the Jivas who are the essence of
Parampurush by using their extraordinary power to create
and destroy.
The fourteen Worlds are within the body. From the feet
to the hip, there are seven lower worlds (1) Atal, (2) Vital,
(3) Sutal, (4) Talaatal, (5) Mahatal, (6) Rasatal and (7)
Paatal. Above thses is Seven upper Worlds: (1) Muladhar
Chakra [Anus] 'Earth element'- Ganesha resides here. It
arose from 'Sat' Shabd. (2) Swadishthan Chakra [Brahma
Lokh] (at the sex organ)- Is the seat of Brahma and Savitri.
All the creation eminates from here. It is a place of element
'Water'. It arised from 'Omkar' Shabd. (3) Manipur Chakra-
Nabhi (Naval): Vishnuji and Lakshmiji resides here. He is


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **107**
the sustainer of creation. This is Vishnu Lok and the
element 'Air' is present. It arose from 'Soham' Shabd. (4)
Hruday Sthaan- Shivji and Parvatiji lives here, this is also
called as Shivlok. There are 7 0 types of musical sounds
(Anhad Dhun) arises here. It is the seat of Fire element
which arose from the word Jyoti/Alakh Niranjan. (5) Kanth
Chakra- Adi Shakti resides here. (6) Agya Chakra between
the eyebrow. It is of two petal Lotus, seat of Atma. (7)
Sahastrasaar Chakra- This is the world of Niranjan, the spot
where married ladies apply the vermilion. The Akash
element arose here with the Rarankar sound. Niranjan is
present as Mind here.
Above this starts seven worlds of maze of Niranjan,
Nirakar, Mann. In the Sant matt, these are refered to as
seven worlds of Niranjan. This way above the Sahastrasaar,
there are seven worlds: (1) Achint Lok, (2) Sohang Lok, (3)
Mool Surti Lok, (4) Ankur Lok, (5) Ichha Lok, (6) Vani
Lok and (7) Sahaj Lok.
Above the Brahmand-14 worlds of human body and
seven worlds of Nirakar-Niranjan, lies the eternal world
Amarlok of Satpurush Sahib. The Gyanipurush, Kabir Sahib
has given the description of distance between these seven
worlds and Satlok.From Shunya above 5 Asankhya yojan –
Achint lok, then again above 3 Asankhya yojan –Sohang
lok, then again above 5 Asankhya yojan Surati lok (this
place is origin of Surati-concentration) then above 3
Asankhya yojan –Ankur lok.

Mudra Sadh Rahe Ghat Bhitar, Phir Aundhey Muh Latkey||_
Earlier, our Ancestors, Yogi, Rishi, Sanyasi and even the
Trinity- Devas contemplated and meditated on five mudras-
Chachri, Bhuchri, Agochari, Unmuni and Khechri with five
words (Shabda) as the basis for Sadhana. They have
concentrated on one of these Mudras/Chakras and they have


**108 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
drowned in the experience derived from that Sadhana
(Meditation) as ultimate Paramatma.
**(1) Chachri Mudra** - By meditating one pointedly at a
Third eye (Between the center of two eyes) with the sound
"Jyoti Niranjan", one can activate the fire element. It rises
from the Heart (Chakra) as brilliant light. This way it
illiminates. Even a slight disturbance will lead to the Nabhi
Chakra (Manipura) and merge with Vayu tatva (Element
Air). With the continuous recitation of the sound "Jyoti
Niranjan", the third eye gets illumined. He can perceive
Past, present and future events. Ordinary Human and
Sanyasis cannot look at such Sadhak's eye.
_Jyoti Niranjan Chachari Mudra So Hai Nainan Mahi|
Tehi Ko Jana Gorakh Jogi Mahatej Hai Tahi||_
Guru Gorakhnath was an expert on Chachri mudra.
Sahib Kabir says that one can achieve power with this
dhyan however he will not know the whereabouts of Atma
and its experience. Yogi can only become an expert in
Miracles. Therefore, with "Chachri Mudra" and the sound
"Jyoti Niranjan", one cannot attain Atmic awareness.
**(2)Bhuchri Mudra-** In the Bhuchri mudra, meditating
on the Agya chakra (Trikuti) which is just above the third
eye (Tisra til) with "Omkar" sound will manifest Water
element. A Yogi will experience divine power. Yogeshwar
Vyasa was an expert in this meditation. In this connection
Kabir Sahib says-
_Aum Aumkaar Buchari Mudra, Trikuti Hai Asthana|
Vyaas Dev Tako Pahchaana, Chand Surya Sey Jana||_
Visualising thousands of Brahmands (Universes) with
Suns and Moons and their brilliance, Vyasji has taken
Omkar as the ultimate reality(Paramatma). Out of this
experience with this Mudra and sound, they take Omkar as
the basis of beginning and end of creation. They take
devotion to Omkar shabda as higher than worshipping the
Trinity Gods. By illumining this spot which is between the
Eyes center and the Sahastrasar, one cannot attain Salvation


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **109**
(Moksha). Only the knowledge of creation exists in Omkar.
Due to the Water element, the knowledge of the universe is
its end otherwise; it is only the knowledge of Niranjan.
**( 3 ) Agochari Mudra** - In the Agochari Mudra, they
meditate on the sound 'Soham' at the Hriday Chakra. It
manifests the Air element (Vayu Tattva) and nothing can be
seen. Only an enchanting musical sounds (Anhad Dhun)
results in this meditation. Merging in the enchanting sounds,
they reach the Bhawar Guffa (An air passage in the fore
head) and manifest miraculous powers (Siddhis). There are
seventy different types of blissful sounds in Bhawar Guffa.
It gives enormous strength and one takes it as the ultimate
Paramatma. Kabir Sahibji has clarified that-
_Soham Shabda Agochari Mudra, Bhavargufa Asthana|
Sukhdev Tako Pahichana, Suni Anhad Ki Tana||_
A-go-ch-ar; means, that place which cannot be perceived
with senses (Indriyas). Sukhdevji (Son of Vyasji) was
expert on Agochari Mudra and Sohang Shabd. One who
atunes to this blissful Sounds will wish to keep away from
the crowd. External world will fail to attract his attention.
Mind will mislead this blissful experience of sound as the
ultimate formless entity, Paramatma. Niranjan- the Mind is
the lord of the Anhad Dhuns. Atmic awareness is not a
musical sound. Meeting of Paramatma is with the end of
prayer, effiable and uneffiable sounds (Ajapa and Anhad),
where in the mergance with Param Purush , there will not be
any experience of sounds. Kabir Sahib says-
_Jap Marey Ajapa Marey, Anhad Bhi Mar Jaai|
Surti Samani Shabda Mey, Tako Kal Na Khai||_
Vayu Tattva always remains at the Nabhi Chakra. These
Yogis will not be able to take the Prana to the Tenth Dwaar
(Sahastra Chakra). Sound notes are an aspect of Vayu-Air.
The Parampurush, Truth has no connection with it. Nirakar
Mind is the lord of these sounds. Yogeshwar Shivji (Natraj)
also spends four Yugas listening to these sounds (Anhad
Dhun).


**110 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
**(4) Unmuni Mudra-**
In Unmuni Mudra, a Yogi meditates on the sound 'Sat' in
the Sahastrasar Chakra. In these, the Earth element
manifests with a brilliant light. The spot where an Hindu
married lady applies vermilion and is known as Sahastrasar
Chakra or Niranjan Lok. Concentrating with one
pointedness on these sound 'Sat' at Sahastrasar Chakra, a
Yogi come out of the body (Videh-out of body). By seeing
this brilliant light Raja Janak assumes himself as
Videhi.This is not the brilliant Satlok but it is the world of
Niranjan. This is the base of creation of Niranjan Lok. For
the same reason, even with the out of body experience, one
stays connected with the body. However, the effects of
Body, Mind and Wealth will end along with the 'My-ness'.
Other than the service to the society, nothing remains. Kabir
Sahib says in this connection;
_Sat Shabda So Unmuni Mudra, Soi Akaash Sanehi|
Tamey Zilmil Jyoti Dikhavey, Jana Janak Videhi||_
In the Sadhana of Unmuni Mudra with 'Sat' Shabd, earth
element manifests; therefore, naturally the Prana will move
towards the Nabhi Chakra till one dies. There won't be any
effort to move the Prana towards Sahastrasar or tenth door.
It means, there won't be any experience of the eleventh door
and the Satlok, they can only witness the brilliant space of
Niranjan Lok. The bliss experienced will be more than that
of the other three Mudras. Being in the body, they are free
from the effect of their action. They attain Mukti for crores
of years, on re-birth they will get the birth of a King or
Rishi, and the pleasure thereoff. They will not attain
permanent salvation (Param Mukti). This Bhakti Yog also
depends on one's own effort- Sadhana. Without the presence
of Satguru, at the time of departure, reaching Satlok is not
possible.
**(5) Khechari Mudra-**
The fifth Mudra requires recitation of the sound
RRarankar and concentration on the crest of the head-


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **111**
Sahastrasar (the top location of the hair knot). This
manifests Akash tattva (Element Ether) which opens up the
tenth door, which is an entry to the Sushumna. It is from the
Sushumna nadi, Niranjan manages the bodily activities.
Yogis search for him thinking that he is the Satya Purush-
The Supreme Lord. Entering through this Sushumna with
Dhyan, they take the Prana and attain a very subtle body.
They travel to various worlds and enjoy their pleasures. The
pleasures of other Mudras are lower compare to Khechari
Mudra.
Devotion to the formless-Nirakar is difficult compare to
other form of devotions. Every Yog Mudra requires a
complete involvement for one pointed effort on meditation
throughout the life, all yogi gets heaven, only there is
difference between levels of heaven which they get.
Kabir Sahib says in his words-
_Rarankaar Khechari Mudra Dasva Dwaar Thikana|
Brahma Vishnu Maheshwar Deva, Rarankaar Pehchana||_
Niranjan pervades the creation and in the form of Mind
in every body. Niranjan creating Brahma, Vishnu,
Maheshwar in union with Adi Shakti, gave them to Adi
Shakti to delegate the responsibility of creation, sustainance
and dissolution. Adi Shakti with her Maya and the three
Devtas manifests as the bodies of Jivas. For this reason, the
three Devas could not take Gyani Purush (Kabir Sahib) as
Satguru and not receive the Satya-Naam of Param Purush.
They are powerless to enter the eleventh door, and deprived
of entry to Amarlok, because of hinderance. Just as, the
pleasure of sex is higher than all the other enjoyment,
similar is the bliss of entering the Sushumna Nadi among
the forms of Yoga. Maheshwar, who is known as the
foremost Yogeshwar retains his subtle body for four Yugas
till the end of creation with the boon from Adi Shakti. For
this reason, he is the chief of Tamasik nature including the
five Vritis (tendencies). His devotees address him as Bholey
Nath. Due to the attraction of the creation and its


**112 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
attachment, Shivji did not take Naam-Daan from Sahib. He
is the bestower of boon and lord of dissolution.
There is a vast difference (like the earth and sky) in the
experience of bliss of the Sant and Yogeshwar. Yogi
experience the pleasures of Heavens, Vaikunth, etc for
millions of years. Whereas the bliss of the Sant is that of the
Eternal World-The Amarlok, which is endless. Yogi's
pleasure arise from the innermost cells of body-centers, in
this Sushumna Nadi is supreme. All these are part of
devotions to Niranjan, and is not free from Karmic action.
All these are based on the earning of meritorious action
(Kamayi), which determines the level of pleasures attained.
In the Satguru Bhakti (Satya Bhakti), there is no need to
activate the power centers or the Sushumna through self
effort (Kamayi). In the Naam Diksha from the Satguru and
faith in him is a guarantee to cross the eleventh door and
attain the eternal world (Param Moksh Dham).
To make the Yogis and Rishis aware about the transient
nature of pleasure they drive, Sant Samrat Kabir Sahib
questions them as to where they fix the concentration
(Meditate) after the Sushumna Nadi also gets destroyed
with the body?
_Siddh, Sadhu Tridevadi Le, Panch Shabda Mey Atkey|
Mudra Sadh Rahe Ghat Bhitar, Phir Aundhey Muh Latkey||_
Just as a rare person can merge in the only one choosen
form (Sagun) with his intense devotion and experience a joy
similarly, in the devotion to formless (Nirgun) - Yogi,
Siddha, Sadhu and Tridev etc they are able to fix their
concentration-meditate on any one Mudra and its sound
with devotion. With the devotional efforts made life after
life on these Mudras helps one can activate any one power
centre, in which actiavation of Sushumna is a highest level.
Both these methods of Bhakti- Kamayi (Sadhana) is not
easy for an ordinary man to attain. The stories and the
words of the scriptures are for the easy attainment of mental
satisfaction and this comes under Sagun and Nirgun Bhakti.


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **113**
Because of it’s superficial decorative form and taking as a
easy way for the fulfillment of their own interest, ordinary
people gather there in large number. The Gyani-Pandit does
not allow ordinary people to seek a Satguru, Satya Naam
Diksha and Bhakti, which is free from KarmaKand (Action-
Reward). This is the speciality of the world of Niranjan and
its regulation.
The Nirakar-Niranjan in the form of Mind is the creator
and ruler of these worlds, to whom Devi and Devtas submit.
He is the conductor behind Prayer, Appeal, witness,
tolerance, giver, Yagya-Sacrificial Fire, Tirth-Pilgrimage,
Vrat-Observance of vows, rituals, etc. He is the facilitator of
wicked activities, vices, and violence, theft, fraud and
sinfull deeds. He is the bestower of Karma, fruits of Karma,
Swarg-Heaven and Narak-Hell. Satya Lok-Param Moksh
Dham is the very form of Param Purush, why would he bind
his own Hansas of his essence in Karmic activities. As a
crown of creation, man should in a honest and unbiased
manner enquire as to why the spark of Paramatma (of his
essence) Jivas are bound in actions and its consequences
(Karmabandhan). Why are they ever dissatisfied and
unhappy? Why under the direction of Mind they are
involved in the worldly ocean of pleasure and pain?
Good and bad karmas and its Heaven and Hell extend
upto the three worlds. For the fruits of action, different
Karmas, various forms of Devotions, various religious
institutions, all these are nothing but the Leelas of Trilok
Swami in the form of Mind. For the Leelas, Niranjan has
created various Avatars. Satya Purush gave Mansarovar (a
part of Satlok) to Niranjan for his seperate creation because
Satya Purush was pleased with his devotion when he
meditated for Yugas and Yugas. Hansas (Atma) were given
to keep them only in the imperishable bliss. Niranjan
discretely, fraudlently and pervertedly created three
perishable worlds and proclaimed himself as Kal Niranjan.
Therefore, Kabir Sahib asked to be Atmically aware-


**114 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
_Mann Hi Niranjan Kal Karala, Jiv Raha Bharmay|
Hey Hansa Tu Amarlok Ka, Pada Kal Vash Aay||_
Man always lives with desires and dissatisfaction. The
fundamental reason for this is Atma that is bound in the
body, is of imperishable blissful nature of Satlok. To show
the Hansas their original home and give the knowledge of
self, Param Purush sends Gyan Roopi Kabir Sahib in every
Yuga. Only a real Satguru has a power to free the Hansas
from the botheration of worldly ocean of Life. In order that
human should not identify a Satguru, Kalpurush has created
Lakhs of Religious Gurus to create confusion. Niranjan has
created various forms of attractions along with Dharma
(Religions) and religious places.
_Nirgun Naam Niranjan Gai, Jin Sari Utpatti Banai||
Nirgun Jo Bhaya Aakasha, Tasey Teeno Gun Vistaara||
Nirgun Se Man Bhayo Prachanda, Tako Vaasal Sakal
Brahmanda||_
With the three gunas (characteristics- Good, Passionate
and Dull), the formless Mind keeps the Jiva in four
Awasthas- (Wakeful, Deepsleep, Dream and Turiya States)
and six Yog sharir (Gross, Subtle, Causal, Super causal,
Gyaan-Knowledge and Vigyaan- Wisdom Bodies). Keeping
under the control of the above states, Hansas are delluded
into believing that there is no other eternal world than that
of Niranjan. Experiencing the gross and subtle bodies and
moving through the three worlds, Atma has accepted
Niranjan's world as its own.
Man lives normally in the four states- Wakeful,
Deepsleep, Dream and Turiya States. Other lifeforms does
not have these four states.
**Jagrat Awastha (Wakeful state)-** First is the wakeful
stage in which Atma resides in the eyes,'Jagrat Mey
Chakshu Mey Vaasa'. Sants consider this as the state of
ignorance. All that we accumulate in this state is verily
betrays. Due to the presence of concentration- Surti in the
eyes, we see the created world of five elements. In this, the


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **115**
external organs of action are active. Just as everything
appears real in the dream but disappears on waking up.
Similarly, the experiences of wakeful stage are nothing but
deceptions born out of foolishness. Many times, we fall into
such foolishness and do such act that we regret later and
then we ponder about our action as to what we have done
for the action being not proper and not good.
If the Dream state takes 4-5 hours, the wakeful dream
takes the entire life from birth to death. Some live for many
years. In this state, Father-Mother appear real, brother and
sister appear real, son, daughter and grandchildren all
appear real. Even their relations and friends appear real. In
this wakeful state, we see the vast creation. In reality, all
that we see and perceive are the play of Chitt (Memory).
Nanakji has commented on this state-
_Jyo Sapna Pekhana, Jag Rachna Tim Jaan|
Ismey Kachhu Sancho Nahi, Yaha Nanak Sanchi Maan||_
In this state, Mind and Atma influences equally. Western
philosopher Gete also states--- 'This universe is my creation,
I am the experiencer so it exist otherwise there is no
existence of this creation.' This world is a projection of your
thought, we perceive this universe in our awareness
(Chetan). This is also an illusion and it is unreal. Whatever
we accumulate and experience as pleasure and pain are all
illusions. It is all projection of our thoughts and
imaginations with which we experience this phenomenal
worlds. Mind has imprisoned Atma and utilises Atma in all
its activities.
**Swapna Awastha (Dream State)-** Dream is also the
state of ignorance. In this state, Atma resides in the throat.
This is a state of deception, in this we commit such an
unworthy act which we won't even do in wakefull state. All
that you get and experience in this state are deceptive. We
even become a King in the dream, sometimes we have
nightmare, sometime we stumble and drop and sometimes
we are thrilled and ellated. Sometime we see good and some


**116 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
other time we see bad in this state. In addition to this gross
form, you get another body to experience this state. In the
dream state, our Atma remains on the left side inner-cell
center (Koshika) in the throat. It is thousand time smaller
than the hair thickness, in that merges our dhyaan. If this is
afflicted, one cannot have dream. Man spends a big part of
his life in the dream state. All that we see in dream about
the universe are full of suprises and this is a projection.
When we transcend from dream stage into awaken state,
that dream world disappears. Dream appears to be full of
imaginations but it is also a state. In this state, the Mind's
action is 75% and the awareness of Atma is 25%. It means
Mind utilises 75% power of Atma.
**Sushupti Awastha (Deep sleep state)-** the third state is
of Deep Sleep. In which we have a sound sleep. When we
suddenly wake up from Sound sleep, we get disoriented and
it takes time to recognise the surroundings and self. This is
called Sushupti Awastha, in this state Atma takes its seat in
the Nabhi-Navel. This is the state of higher ignorance. If
one concentrates on its navel deeply, he can attain deep
sleep. Nabhi is an important center for deep sleep.
Sometime it becomes natural. In this state, one lacks
complete awareness like a person in coma. When you
awake from this state, you cannot even perceive your head
and feet immediately. It takes some moments for the Atma,
Surti and Dhyan to come to the eye and perceive your
condition and location.
When you are in the state of deep sleep, your thought,
discrimination and perceptions are stopped. Brain gets
complete rest. One reaches deep sleep with the activation of
spinal cord. In the dream state brain is active. If there is an
experience of danger as part of a dream then the brain
interfaces with the thought. In the deep sleep, there are no
thoughts because of the inactivity in the functions of brain
cells.


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **117**
A Yogi can attain this state where there is neither
pleasure or pain. Yogi takes this state as Anandmayi (Bliss
seat). However, Sants call it as a state of ignorance. In the
state of Sushupti, Mind is in a condition of seizer.
**Turiya Awastha (Causal state)-** The fourth state is
Turiya Awastha. In this, the Pran Vayu enters into the
Sushumna Nadi. When Pran Vayu enters Sushumna, the
whole universe can be visualised. The play and role of five
elements in the body-brahmand and including the material
world becomes appearant. We can perceive the inner worlds
in the state of awareness (Chaitanya Sthiti). In this state the
mind is active 25% and Atma is active 75%. Rishi, Muni,
and the likes reach this state. The first three states usually
come and goes. However, turiya state is not usual.
On reaching the state, one will see this world as transient
and temporary. With this even the awaken state feels like an
illusion. The divine beings are also in this state, which is
also called as Pragya Awastha.
**Turiya tith (Super Causal State)** Another level which
is known as Maha Pragya awastha (Turiya tith). In this
state, a jeeva attains an eternal awareness and proclaims
'Aham Brahmasmi.' Only a Yogeshwar can attain Turiya
Tith state. There are only six Yogeshwars in time- Shivji,
Dattatraya, Shukdev, Vyasji, Vasudev Krishna, and Gorakh
Nathji. To see the three worlds of the Brahmand and to
perceive it within the body is also the delusion of
impermanent ocean of existance.
Only by going beyond this impermanent mortal world
Kabir Sahib and later Sants described the majesty and the
grandeur of the eternal world of Amarlok. That eternal
world can only be reached only by transcending Turiya Tith
state, and with the Satya Naam and the grace of Satguru.
Only the Sants stay in that state completely free from that
Mind. Sahib Kabir has clarified that in this three world of
Mind and Maya, not only Rishi, Muni, Tapasvi, Sanyasi,
Yogi even the trinity Gods are deluded.

Tulsi Sahib (Hathraswale) says--
_Khechari Bhuchari Sadhey Soi|Aur Agochari Unmuni Joi||
Unmuni Basey Akaas Ke Mahi|Jogi Bas Kare Tehi Thahi||
Yeh Jogi Mati Kaha Pasara|Sant Mat Puni Insey Nyaara||

Sahib says-
_Sat Shunya Sat Hi Kamal, Sat Surati Sthana|
Ikkis Brahmand Lag, Kal Niranjan Gyaan||
Gupt Bhayo Hai Sang Sabke, Mann Niranjan Janiye|
Mann Hi Saakar Man Hi, Niraakar Niranjan Janiye||_
The six bodies- The five Mudras of the Yog Sadhana,
four states of human life and in the Turiya Tith state Kal
Niranjan in the form of Mind is active in the six bodies (As
per Sant Mat Of Kabir Sahib).

**1. Sthul Sharir (Gross Body- consious):** Gross body is
    impermanent. In this 5organs of action, 5 senses and 4
    inner senses are present. With this gross body, everyone
    is engaged in action. It is evident to all of us, we dwell
    in this body and we experience it. Along with the state
    (Awastha) of man, various divine powers are present in
    body organs.
**2. Sukshma Sharir (Subtle Body-conscience):** This body
    is available to us in the dream state. It is also called as
    Ling Dehi. In this state of body all the worlds are
    evident. Subtle body and its functions are very unique.
    In the dream, everything appears real and true. Entering
    into this body, Mind takes you into surprising and
    strange worlds. Man spends 1/3rd of his life in sleep.
    With the subtle body, we can experience in traveling to
    very strange places. The experiences of the subtle body
    are similar to those of Gross body by perceptions.
**3. Karan Sharir (Causal body- Consciousness):** This
    body is present with everyone. Sometime you enter into
    Causal body in the Wakeful state. For example- you are
    seated in Satsang, , looking at me, listening to Satsang
    and assimilate it. If for some time, your Dhyan makes a


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **119**
detour like your home, relations etc. then even inspite of
your physical presence here, you cannot hear me and
cannot see me. You cannot understand the Satsang. You
will be sitting with the eyes open, that's all. It means
with our causal body, Mind can take us to anywhere. If
this body is understood, we can deliberately use it to
travel and see, observe, and analyse distant places. We
enter such a strange bodies but we are not aware about
its working to utilise it fully.
Sage Vashishtha had complete knowledge of this
body. This body is in the gross body, the causal body is
very subtle. Everyone uses this body. With this body
sometime you reach your near and dears, sometimes to
know the future, you reach there. In the Causal body, we
do get the power to see.

**4. Maha Karan Sharir (Super Causal body-Pure**
    **Consciousness):** it is a wonderful and strange body. In
    this Mind gives various experiences. Yogis travel to
    various places in this Brahmand with this body. This is
    refered to as reaching the third center, (Trinity Gods
    remain in this Body. Sants transcend even this Body)
_Khas-Khas Ke Dane Ke Andar Shahar Khuda Ka Basta Hai|
Basat Kare Naino Ke Til Mey Vahi Uska Rasta Hai||
Ruh Rakaney Mey Thaharai Soi Bukur Mey Dhasta Hai|
Par Bin Mehar Murshid Ke Tu Nahak Mey Pachata Hai||_
    In this strange body, you can perceive your complete
individuality (Vyaktitva). You will be conscious of your
existance, of your sight, hearing, moving, and talking. This
body is like, taking the butter out of churing the curd. With
this body and through yoga, we can separate the Super
causal body. With this body, you can experience the entire
Brahmand.
**5. Gyaan Dehi (Wisdom body-Awareness):** In this body,
the men of penance, Tapasvis remains in Brahma
consciousness and proclaims 'Aham Brahmasmi.' With
this body, one gets the power to create a universe.


**120 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
Emperor Bali, Vashishtha and Vishwamitra; they all had
such a power that even Devas were fearfull of them.
Dadu Dayalji spoke about Gyan Dehi- 'Sabki Gathari Lal,
Koi Nahi Kangaal|' everyone has got Gyaan Dehi. With
this body, one can travel only within this three world.
You can see the worlds within the void space (Shunya).
Like we take a ride on a motor cycle or a car on the road
but it cannot stay on the water. It does not have the system
to float on the water. In the same way more than Gross,
Subtle, Causal and Super Causal body you get more power
with the Wisdom body. You get so much power, whatever
you utter will happen, whatever we will that will take place.
You get the power of Kalpa Siddhi. You get the power of
Maaran, Maran, Sam-mohan, Uchchatan, Vashikaran. The
power of Ashtasiddhi and NavNiddhi also manifest. This is
body is filled with mysterious powers.
**6.Vigyaan Dehi (Higher-Wisdom body, Higher-
Awareness):** This is a very subtle body, which can move
with very high speed. With this body, one can travel upto
Maha Shunya. In this body, Mind remains weaker. Atma
remains very active. The fact remains that this body has
Mind and its influence. Even in this state, individual cannot
be free of Mind. Vigyaan Dehi is so subtle that it can pass
through rock. Many sants have described this body among
them are Kabir Sahib and Guru Nanakji.
_Trikuti madhya basey niranjan, moondhey dasvan dwar.
Uske ooper makar taar hai, chado sambhar sambhar._
Kabir Sahib says that in-between the eye brows there is the
abode of Niranjan. He has closed the 10th dwara. Above it is the
Makar Tar (an ethereal wire over which our Surti moves).
_Nau dware sansar sabb, dusvein yogi sadh.
Ekadash khidki bani, janat sant sujan._
It is the common people whose life force escapes through any of
the nine dwaras while in case of yogis it escapes through the 10th
dwara. On the other hand, it is the Sants alone who have the
knowledge of the 11th dwara.

## 9. Means to counter the Mind power.

One who fights against the powers of Mind i.e.Kam
(desire), Krodh (anger), Lobh (greed), Moh (attachment),
Ahankar (Ego), by Constant rememberance of 'Satya Naam'
with the wisdom of Vivek (Spiritual discrimination) is an
follower of True Dharma (Righteousness).
_Pragatey Prem Vivek Dal, Kahe Kabir Samzaai|
Ugra Gyaan Ati Bali, Jehi Sun Moha Daraai|
Indri Dushta Maha Apradhi| Kutil Kam Koi Virle Sadhaa||
Kamini Roop Kaal Ki Khani|Tajhu Tasu Sang Ho Guru Gyaani||
Jabki Kam Umang Tan Aavey|Tahi Samay Jo Aap Jugavey||
Shabd Videha Surat Lo Rakhey|Gahi Man Maun Nam Ras Chakhey||_
Dharma and Wisdom are the minister and the chief of
army of Vivek. Love and Devotion are the flag bearer and
the band of Vivek. The 'Bliss of Truth' is the palace in
which Faith is the queen who maintains it. 'Fearless Sant'
and 'Good Character' are the sons of Vivek. The family of
King Vivek is saturated with only 'Love and Bliss'. Vivek
has four daughters- Compassion, Forgiveness, Mercy and
Virtue; they are auspicious for the Truth. 'Truth and Bliss'
are always with Vivek and they keep away from the Hell.
'Wise intellect' is like a servant (Dasi) which maintain
dignity. Dhyaan like a servant gets all the work done. A
renounciate (Vairagi) is seated with 'Pious conduct
(Suchita)', 'Virtue (Sheel)', 'Stream of Love (Anurag)' and
Forgiveness. Simplicity is the seat of Vivek. Vow, the Chief
minister and Truth is the preacher of Vivek. Fearlessness is
the Minister who stays closer and illuminates. Veda also
serves the Vivek.

1. We can recognise with the Wisdom of Vivek that
body is nothing but heap of Blood-Flesh-Bone-Skin and
Hair are the army of Desire of Kamini. From the nine exit
doors of the body, comes out Mucus, Saliva, Sweat, Wax,
Fecal matter, Urine. Nails create diseases. Other than, the
dirt and worries, there is no happiness in the Body; not even


**122 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
in the dream. In this way, the wisdom of Vivek destroys the
army of Desires and Lust. Surti (concentration) diagnosis
with the help of Shabda (Naam) destroys the supreme
power of Mind- 'Desire and Lust'.

2. When the purpose of Desire is not served then he called
anger.Anger enters the Individuality and in the Mind and
fights with the Vivek. Anger which comes to give success
to Kaam, can be defeated with associates of Vivek like
Courage, Action, Contentment, Good-Intellect, Knowledge
by forgiveness. Forgiveness with its bow of Virtue and with
the smile of devotional wisdom stops the battle. Flame of
Anger should be subdued with sweet words. Just as fire is
put down by water, in the same way in front of Forgiveness,
the fire of Anger is extinguished.
    3. Greed (Lobh) is a demonic minister of Attachment
(Moha), it is stronger than desire and hatred. The Wisdom
has to consult Vivek (Spiritual Discrimination) and take the
support of contentment (Santosh). Contentment will end
Greed with the help of equanimity. With the rememberance
of Naam, contentment will stop the arrow of Greed in its
course. Contentment born out of Wisdom will make the
Greed powerless. When Greed takes the suicidal tendency,
contentment takes a support of compassionate wisdom and
makes the Greed ineffective. Contentment keeps us alert
and counters the seduction of Greed. When the ordinary
people are hunted by the Greed for any particular thing,
then contentment reveals that these things is for Kings, not
for me and free them. When the Greed shows the attraction
of it's Gold, Silver, contentment makes it known that these
cannot accompany us when we leave. Contentment fires the
arrow of truth on the army of Greed and subdues it with
patience.
    _Kam Krodh Vichale, Vichale Lobh Akaaj|
Mahamoha Man Mey Lakhey, Gayo Hamaro Raj||
Kam Krodh Dou Gaye, Gaye Lobh Dal Bhaaj|
Daya Kshama Santosh Bal, Rahe Vivek So Gaaj||_

```
4. Kabir Sahibji has described that the devotee who bears
Satya Naam, by his compassion of Vivek, forgiveness and
contentment strikes at the Desire-Hatred and Greed like
lightning of the thunder and drive away their forces.
    Satya's wisdom of Vivek defeats the family of Mind and
Maya Vs (Desire) Kaam, Hatred (Krodh), Greed (Lobh) and
Attachment (Lobh). Lastly Moha taking the support of Ego,
attacks wisdom of Vivek. In this situation, Desire and Pride
remains fearfull. Under the leadership of Moha, with his
boosting, Pride tries to induce forgetfullness on wisdom. To
escape, remain alert with wisdom and with the weapon of
compassion, eliminate the Anger of Pride. Destroy the
drowsy distractive delusion of Desire with the power of
Alertness and Awareness. With the light of Wisdom of
Vivek, destroy the darkness of ignorance of Desire.

## 10. EVERYONE BELONGS TO US

World is driven by a freak passion. They lack time. Does
a child wish to go to school? Never. Are the parents not
worried? They worry a lot, because they are aware that the
future will become useless. In the same way, the
Mahapurush knew that the world does not care about Mukti.
I reach out all places with this physical body. For what
benefit? Those who cannot reach Ranjadi Ashram (H.Q),
they will reach me. Other Gurus do not do the same. I had
given you a habit. This way we reach out to people. I know,
everyone's mind is occupied with some Guru or another. All
are busy. It is like asking me to say that if you do not get a
good character woman as wife, you can marry to unchaste
woman. This is our compulsion. There is no other way.
Even if we get someone, he happens to be one who takes
alcohol. We ask such people to come with the assurance to
change them. They know that their followers are flocking to
me, hence they are worried. That is why they accuse. I take
it with forbearance. If you put someone into loss, they will
accuse you. You will tolerate. They will get annoyed. They
are also ours. Our sight is set in anticipation but they look
for revenge.
All other Panths are watchful of us. They wish to
proclaim the size of their organization. Some make huge
Ashrams. An Elephant is huge; however, the roar of a Tiger
makes it to lie down to the ground. What is the specialty of
a Tiger? It is a hunter and the best one at it.
Can anyone catch the Cat with his hand? Compared to
the Cat, Tiger is stronger. One cannot control a Cat by his
hand. Tiger's skin is thick. Even if you try to knife it, it will
rebounce. With his claws, it can snatch away 1.5 to 2 kg
flesh. Tiger is a clever hunter. Its jaws are very strong. It
pulls down even bigger animals biting their neck. What an
agility, speed, and precision. It has extraordinarily strong


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **125**
body. Its skin makes it very strong. Even a small cut will
not deter it. Tail and face are the weaker part of it.
I do not run away. Even if I go out of the country, it will
be for bringing awareness among people. It is not limited to
Bharat (India) alone. Even there, there are Jivas ready for
salvation. There are many who belong to Sahib resides
outside India. Perhaps, why do people oppose? Why there is
hatred between crow and cuckoo bird? If there is an
opposition, there is a reason for it. We have to observe
silence and not to get into altercation. Cuckoo doesn not
know how to hatch its own egg. It has a long tail. It is not
possible. Snake cannot make home for itself on its own; it
steals the home of rats.
Cuckoo is very clever. Our Mind is just like Cuckoos.
Crow is an enemy. It is a very active bird. Both male and
female cuckoos go near the nest of a crow where Crow had
laid 4-5 eggs. At the sight of Cuckoo, Crow gets angry.
They chase them. Wherever I go, people of other Panths
gets annoyed.
The Male cuckoo flies very fast, the female one is little
slower. Crow cannot catch the cuckoo. Male Cuckoo goes
to the nest of a crow that has eggs. Crow chases the Male
Cuckoo. They chase them for a very long distance. In a
meanwhile, the Female Cuckoo lays its egg and removes
away one egg of the crows from the nest so that Crow
cannot recognize. If there are more eggs, Crow will get
doubt. The Female crow hatches the eggs. That is why you
see very few Cuckoos. The cuckoo often goes to meet. The
crows chase them together. In between, the Female cuckoo
comes and makes the chick hear her voice.
_Nij Kul Vachan Sunat Sut Jaga||_
Listening to its voice, the chick gets concentrated. This
is its nature. It sits close by and gives the sign that it belongs
to the cuckoo and not to the crow. Little by little, it teaches
it. When crow comes, it hides itself. Just like an adopted
child recognizes the foster parents when they take them in


**126 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
arms. Therefore, the chick also begins to understand.
Similarly, the chicks also recognize. The Cuckoo slowly
teaches the chick. I have also told you the stories of
Niranjan. When the chick becomes bigger, the Male cuckoo
lets the crows chase it. They follow the Cuckoo. In between,
the Female cuckoo goes to the nest and guides away the
chick from the nest. The crows return back to see that the
chick has been taken away. They think that Cuckoo has
taken it and changing it into another Cuckoo. They don't
realize that it originally belongs to the Cuckoos. The truth is
it has taken its own chick. We are taking our own Hansas.
_Kal Ka Jiv Maney Nahi, Kotin Kahu Samuzaai||
Mey Kichat Hu Satlok Ko, Yaha Bandha Yampur Jaai||_
The chick, which does not atune to Cuckoo, will remain
as a crow. That which is fully black is also the chick of
Cuckoo. However they don't get the proper food. Our work
is very difficult. Wherever I go, people create impediment
for conducting Satsang and in the construction of Ashram.
After my Satsang is over, the hypocrites conduct the
meeting at the same night.
_Jagat Bhagat Mey Bair Hai, Charo Yug Parmaan||_
When you join us, they lost you and so they are
concerned. So they are opposing me and I stay quiet and
forbear it. In some Satsangs, a Female Pandit is to interrupt
the Satsang by singing bhajan. She had compulsion to do so
because earlier she was getting offerings from some people
who have now joined me and she felt at loss.
The elders- Sayana are very angery with us. We also
understand that they are at loss in their business. We have
removed the talisman worn by people (presumably for their
protection from evil spirits and evil effects). They began to
think as to where the articles which they gave to the people
are been thrown away. With lot of efforts we have deluded
the people and gave them. They know no other form of
vocation; they have learnt only this for their livelihood. We
understand their loss but we are also bound to take our


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **127**
people in the correct direction. In devotion, we have to be
righteous in conduct. The people of the other panths come
to us so their organizations are concerned about desertion.
These group of people move around all places, they meet
and speak to people. We are not forefully taking their
aquintances through violence, we do the job of Cuckoo.
_Kahey Kabir Tu Basa Brahm Ke Desh|_
You are living in the world of delusion. I know how
much you understand my words. You do not take my word
seriously. However, it is getting ingrained in your
Awareness (Chetan). It reaches your core of inner senses.
However, you are oblivious to it due to the influence of
Mind. One deputy commisioner reached Akhnoor for a
discussion. He said he he has seen prominent personalities
in life, their words enter Mind but not into the core of me
but your words goes straight to the heart.
He was a Muslim literate. Every word of Mine reaches
your heart because I speak from my heart. I speak with
oneness of credibility.
_Kathani Ke Shura Karni Ke Koora||_
Many people do not follow their own advice. If word
and action are same then world will be full of bliss.I know, I
am making you stronger, but still you get deluded because
of the association you keep.
Do not follow the world. If someone says, it is a
criminal mistake, do not listen to them. I question such
people that what is their strength of evaluation. Even for
Headache, they will say someone is plotting to murder them
(evil effect). With what device they are trying to murder
you?
You are living in such a surrounding, which creates such
a belief. Hypocrites also joined to delude you. In our
country, people beleive in existance of evil spirits. The
whole country is soaked in this business. Attachment,
dettachment, entanglement and escape, everything happens


**128 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
in India. It pervades the entire nation with different names
and versions.
What is their work, to delude the people. The gang
which misguide you, is a formidable one. They search for
people who are in illusion. They earn on your ignorance.
Remain strong in rememberance of Satguru. In reality they
(hypocrites) are also of our own. When they understand
clearly, they take to following us. I have give Naamdan to
many mis-informers.
....So we work like cuckoo bird. If the cuckoo fails to
retrieves its chick, the chick will remain as crow. It feeds on
dirty things. If it is the crow chick, it will be completely
black.
Brothers I have come to enlighten you. You belong to
us, to the eternal world Amarlok but you are living in the
world of Niranjan.
The crows chase the cuckoo, but they cannot harm. In
the same way, you remain strong nobody can harm you.
Remain under the direction and contact of Satguru.
Remember this-
_Muzey Hai Kam Satguru Se, Duniya Ruthe Toh Ruthan De||_

## 124 11 The Twelve Panths of Mind. 10. Everyone belongs to us.

All the Kabir Panths are under the influence of Nirakar
Niranjan. When Kabir Sahib came to this universe, Niranjan
refused his entry and fought with Sahib, then Sahib won a
battle over him. Niranjan pleaded with Sahib that when
Sahib goes to this mortal world, with the help of Naam, he
will take every soul with him to Amarlok, I was awarded by
promise of Parampurush, do you want to break that? Wether
you want to keep Atmas in the world or not?
As stated earlier, Niranjan has brought complete
destruction (Mahapralaya) of the universe many times
before. He absorbs Planet and Stars within himself. Taking
all the souls, he goes near Amarlok; he pleads with
Parampurush to take back all Atmas and tells that it does
not wish to make creation again. He hears the voice of
Param Purush, directing him to return and create the
universe. Since, he received it as a boon.
Question arises many times, as to why one has to put so
much effort? Sahib can give Mukti to the entire world.
However, he does not wish to take those who desire this
world. Niranjan is also one of the sons of Param Purush.
Niranjan asked a Question that whoever develops devotion
to Param Purush would attain liberation from this world.
Then the world will become empty. Therefore, take me also
into your Amarlok. Otherwise, let these souls be in illusion-
Maya and I will run 12 Panths in your name. Sahib agreed
because of the boon given. That is why souls are in
entanglement.
_Dwadash Panth Kal Parmana|
Bhuley Jiv Na Pay Thikana||_
Among the 12 panths some will speak about Bijak
(words of Kabir Sahib), some will claim Atma-Soul as
ultimate God, some will talk about Sat Naam, some will
take to the devotion of Raam, some will talk about eternal
world (Paramdham), some will only talk about Harijans.


**130 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
Therefore, they will run the seat of panth with their own
family. Their disciples will not reach Amarlok, they will be
under the control of Niranjan.
47 lakhs year makes 4 Yugas-eons. If 4 Yugas are
complete, it becomes 1 Chaukdi. 4x100 Yugas will make
100 Chaukdi. After 100 it will be Thousand, then 10
Thousand, Lakh, 10 Lakh, Crore, 10 Crores, Arab, 10 Arab,
Kharab, Neel, 10 Neel, Padam, 10 Padam, Sankhya, 10
Sankhya, Asankhya, 10 Asankhya, then Anant.
Until now, 4 Asankhya Chaukdi Yug is completed since
the beginning of creation. Meaning the universe is
completely destroyed and recreated more than a Arab times.
Param Purush says you have to complete the term (17
Chaukdi Asankhya Yug). Once Niranjan asked that, he also
should be blessed with Sat Naam. Param Purush has replied
that if he gives Naam to him, he cannot do his wicked
activities. If he gives up your wickedness, all Atmas will be
released.
Here people will be mystified. It appears that Param
Purush does not wish that all Jivas should attain salvation
and by giving the curse to Niranjan to swallow 1 Lakh Jivas
a day, it has caused pain to the Jivas. No, never. This pain
was given to Niranjan (Mind) only. Atma is unaffected.
This afflicts Niranjan painfully. To understand this is very
difficult.
You had devotion to Niranjan in many previous Lives.
You did many meritorious deeds in many previous lives.
You are very fortunate for obtaining Sat Naam from
Satguru. You are not an ordinary; therefore, your number
has come. Sometimes it is by the grace of Sants on you.

_Atam geyan bina ner bhakte, keya mathura keya Kashi._
Without the spiritual knowledge man continues to wander at the
holy places like Mathura and Kashi.

## 12 Remedies for Mind.

For every disease, there are remidies and a regiment of
treatment. There are some diseases, which Doctors fail to
diagonise and provide treatment and cure. However, with
progressive approach, they identify and treat such a disease.
Mind also afflictes Atma like a disease. Heart of
everyone is kept contaminated with vices. These diseases
are potently strong. Is there any remedy for this? Our Rishi,
Muni, Peer- Paigambar none had any solution for this
affliction of Mind. Sahibji says-
_Naam Hoi Toh Math Namave|Na To Yah Man Bandh Nachave||_
Without any doubt, Mind cannot entangle you (Naami).
Mind becomes helpless. It makes the whole world dance.
The effect of Mind is present in all. The intoxication of
Maya afflicts everyone. However, you are free from the
Mind. With the influence of Mind manifests Kama (desire),
Krodha (anger), Lobha (greed), Moha (attachment), etc. All
these remain in your Mind also, but in the control. They
cannot harm you.
_Purush Shakti Jab Aan Samaai|Tab Nahi Rokey Kal Kasaai||_
If the power of Param Purush is with you, then Kal
cannot do anything to you. On the day of Naam Daan, the
power of Param Purush fills you. Then the influence of Kal
will not work.
I declared that "The thing I possess cannot be found
anywhere in the universe", I am saying it with proof.
Complete Guru- Satguru transforms you. He opens up the
inner eye. When the 10th door (Sahastrasar) opens, we can
see Sun, Moon, and Stars. However, when the 11th door
(Surti) opens, Mind becomes visible.
When this inner eye opens, Desire, Lust, Greed, etc. can
be seen. Otherwise, any amount of Tapas cannot help you to
identify these vices. Kapil Muni, Parashar Rishi, etc. they
have done a very long penance but they could not succeed
in controlling their Mind. Therefore –


**132 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
_Naam Hoi Toh Math Namave|Na Toh Yaha Man Bandh Nachave||_
By the will of Param Purush, Sahib comes to this world
in every Yuga and releases the Jivas from the Kal'S trouble
and take them to Amarlok. First time when Sahib came to
this world, he remained here for hundred years and
returned. He could not take even one soul with him. Param
Purush asked him –"Have you not brought even a single
soul?" Sahib said- No. Param Purush asked as to why it is
so. Sahibji replied that whomever he tells him in the
Morning and he forgets in the evening. If I tell them in the
evening, they forget in the morning. Then Param Purush
gave him a secret thing (Gupt vastu) - Naam. To
whomsoever you give this Naam, Kal's influence will not
work on that person.
Then after receiving that, Sahibji came to Shunya (Void
space) to the Niranjan's Lok. When Sahibji entered,
Niranjan accosted Sahibji at Zanzari dweep (Island) and
asked the reason for his arrival. Niranjan asked Sahib to
return back. There was a lengthy argument. Sahibji said-
_Taaso Kahiyo Suno Dharmaray| Jiv Kaaj Sansaar Sidhayi||
Tapt Sheela Par Jiv Jaravahu| Jaari Vaari Nij Swaad Karavahu||
Tum Aas Kashta Jiv Kah Dinha| Tabahi Purush Mohi Agya Kinha||
Jiv Chitaay Lok Le Jaau| Kaal Kashta Se Jiv Bachau||_
Sahib said- Oh Niranjan! You have kept Atmas under
bondage with your strength and wickedness. Keeping them
in Tapt shila (very hot stone) and by torchuring them, you
enjoy it. Sahib said that Param Purush has sent him. I will
release the Jivas and take them back to Amarlok.
_Tabey Niranjan Boley Baani| Sakal Jiv Bas Humarey Gyaani||
Tinso Sath Paith Urzera| Kaisey Hansan Lev Ubera||_
Niranjan has said that he has entangled everyone. There
are 360 such places where he has kept his powers. Jivas are
enchanted with it. Niranjan enquired as to how he will
release the Hansas?
_Tab Gyaani As Boley Bani| Jamtey Jiv Chhudavahu Aani||
Purush Naam Ko Kahu Samzai| Jum Raja Tab Chhodi Parayi||
Ghat Ghat Baithey Urzera| Humrey Shabd Te Hoy Nibera||_


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **133**
_Sun Re Kaal Dushta Anyayi| Shabd Sang Hansa Ghar Jaayi||_
Sahibji said that he has the Naam of Param Purush with
him. Now you cannot cause any harm to them. Then
Niranjan said-
_Ka Gyaani Deho Adhikara| Humro Naahi Chhutey Jum Jaara||
Panch Pachis Teen Gun Aahi| Yaha Le Sakal Sharir Banayi||
Tamey Pap Punya Ka Vaasa| Man Baitha Le Humri Phasa||
Jaha Taha Jag Bharmavey| Gyaan Sandhi Kuchh Rahan Na
Peavey||
Ek Shabd Ki Keytik Asha| Merey Hey Chourasi Phasa||_
He said that you could not release the Jivas from me. I
have created their body out of five elements. I bound the
Jivas with Merit and Sin and I stay in them as Mind. I do
not even allow anyone to think about the network. What can
your one Naam do? I hanged them with 84 Lakhs of noose.
I move them from one after another.
_Boley Gyaani Shabd Vichari| Chhutey Chourasi Ki Dhari|
Chhutey Panch Pachis Gun Tino| Aisa Shabd Purush Mey Dinho||_
Sahibji said that he has very potent Naam. Whoever
receives it, you cannot do anything to him. He will be free.
Niranjan said-
_Hey Gyaani Ka Karo Badhayi| Humtey Naahi Chhut Jiv Jayi||
Itney Yug Bhaye Tum Dekha| Gyaani Hans Na Eko Pekha||
Ka Tum Karo Ka Shabd Tumhara| Teen Lok Parlay Kar Dara||
Sadhu Sant Hum Dekhi Riti| Parlay Parey Sakal Jagag Jiti||
Karam Rekh Bandhey Sab Sadha| Surr Nar Muni Sakalo Jag

So many Yugas have completed, has any Jiva reached
such Amarlok? I have bound them with great strength, it
cannot be release. You and your one word what it can do? I
destroy all the three worlds.
Niranjan has brought great desolution of universe many
times. He goof up all the universe. Not all these work are of
Sahib.
_Gyaani Kahey Kaal Anyayi| Shabd Bina Tu Khay Chabayi||
Hans Humara Shabd Adhikara| Purush Partaap Ko Karey

**134 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
_Naam Japey Aru Surti Lagayi| Miley Karm Lagey Nahi Kayi||
Shabd Mani Hoy Shabd Sarupa| Nishchay Hansa Hoy Anupa||_
Sahib said- Oh Niranjan, when they did not have satya
Naam, you had eaten them. Now I will give the most potent
Naam of Param Purush and now I will not allow your hold
on Jivas. They will receive the wisdom on Sin and merit
also. Naam will protect them and releasing them from all
bondage, it will take them to Amarlok.
_Nirgun Kaal Tab Boley Baani| Urzey Jiv Sakal Jumkhani||
Kaisey Key Tum Shabd Pasaro| Kauney Vidhi Tum Jiv Ubaro||
Aisey Jiv Sakal Hey Karni| Kaisey Pahunchey Purush Ki Sarni||
Jag Mey Jiv Krodh Vikara| Kaisey Pahunchey Purush Ke Dwara||_
Niranjan told that he has bond everyone with Desire,
Anger, etc. Then how can they reach the world of Param
Purush? Moreover, I have kept 14 Lords of Death inside
everyone’s body. How can you take them? Niranjan said
that the Jivas has become very polluted, no one will accept
your words.
_Gyaani Kahey Karahu Variyara| Humto Kinha Sakal Nirvara||
Joyi Gyaani Hoy Humara| Kam Krodh Te Hoy Niyara||
Trushna Lobh hi Dei Bahayi| Vishey Janam Sab Dur Parayi||
Naam Dhyaan Bal Hansa Ghar Jayi| Kya Re Kaal Tum Karo
Badhayi||_
Sahibji told Niranjan -To whichever body I give the
Naam, your power will never work on them. Kam (Desire),
Anger, etc will never work on them. They will be purified.
You cannot even touch them and taking the form of Hansa,
they will reach the Amarlok.
_Kahey Niranjan Suno Ho Gyani| Kathi Ho Gyan Tumhari Baani||
Yugat Mahatma Sabey Batau| Tumhara Naam Le Panth Chalau||_
Then Niranjan said that he would also take Naam and
run twelve Panths. He will spread the message on False
Naam.
If you look around today, everyone is claiming to be a
Satguru; everybody claims to be a Sant. Everyone is giving
Naam. All these are play of Niranjan. They take appearance


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **135**
of a Sant but talk about Niranjan. Therefore, Niranjan has
even said this-
_Gyani Morey Aparbal Gyana| Ved Kitab Bharam Hum Mana||
Inko Maney Sab Sansara| Kali Mey Ganga Mukti Dwara||
Dehi Dan Se Utarey Para| Aisey Sumrut Kahey Vichara||
Yaha Vidhi Jag Jiv Bhulahi| Jara Maran Sab Bandh Bandhahi||
Sutak Patak Ved Vichara| Puchh Ved Se Karhi Sanhara||
Ekadashi Mukti Ko Bhai| Yog Jagya Karavey Adhikhayi||_
I have entangled Jivas with Ved and Duty of action.
Everyone tries to follow them.
In the Vedas, Niranjan only spoke about himself. Kal
produces Vedas. That is why; there is no information about
Sahib (Param Purush). Niranjan said to Sahib that no one
would accept your word. Therefore, do not go into the
world. Sahibji says-
_Sunahu Kaal Gyan Ki Sandhi| Chhoro Jiv Sakal Ki Phandi||
Jab Nij Bira Hans Pavey| Yog Barat Tap Sabey Nasavey||
Ved Kitab Ki Chhodey Aasa| Hansa Karey Shabd Viswasa||
Takey Nikat Kaal Nahi Aavey| Nij Bira Jo Surat Lagavey||
Jog Barat Patahu Hey Chhara| Adbhut Naam Sada Rakhvara||_
Sahibji says that one who receives Naam, his Ego will
crumble from inside. He will give up Karmakand (Path of
action) and will remain engrossed in the Naam. Naam will
always protect him. Kal will not come near him.
When Niranjan's talk did not work and his position
became unsustainable, then Niranjan angrily told Sahib that
earlier you threw me out of Manasarovar and now you have
come to my world. Therefore, I will take revenge on you.
Niranjan took a form of a huge elephant and attacked on
Sahib.
_Gyani Purush Shabd Kiyo Jora| Pakad Sund Daant Gahi Mora||
Mareu Shabd Paay Par Peli| Tor Sund Samudra Gahi Meli||
Purush Roop Tab hi Puni Dhara| Jaun Saroop Sakal Autara||_
Sahib says that he took the form of Parampurush; with
this Mool Roop (Original Form), he caught the trunk and
whrilled him into the ocean.


**136 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
Then Niranjan lost his strength and pleaded with Sahibji
for forgiveness. He said that he could not recognise that he
is Sahib himself. He said that he was fortunate to have his
Darshan. Niranjan said that Sahibji has come to his world,
pleaded with Sahib to listen to his request, and said as to
what will happen to the curse if he takes all the Jivas to
Amarlok. (Niranjan was cursed to swallow one lakh Jivas a
day.) Niranjan asked whether those who have commited sin
would also be liberated. Sahibji replied that those who
follow my words, tread the path, you shall not touch them.
Others who do not follow my words, you can take them.
_Suno Niranjan Vachan Humara| Nahi Satt Vo Jiv Tumhara||_
This was the agreement between Sahib and Nirakar
Niranjan. Only for the same reason, I ask you to do Bhajan
in breath whenever and wherever it is possible. If it is not
possible, atleast refrain from sinfull acts after the
Naamdaan. Keep the thing, which is given to you safely. Do
not break any code of conduct (Niyam).
_Satya Naam Nij Aushadhi, Khari Niyat Se Khaay||
Aushadh Khaay Aru Path Rahey, Taki Vedan Jay||_
After the Naamdaan, you become aware of your Mind's
work. Then, Mind will become helpless, will become weak.
Once if you know the Mind, all its power fails. After this
realisation, Mind's power will not be effective. When you
take rope as snake, fear affects you. When you realize that it
is only a rope and not a snake, after which even if you
deliberately try to imagine that it is a snake, you cannot.
After knowing the Mind, you will lose worldly attraction.
Mind can be seen. You will realize that it is only the Mind,
which likes. There ends the strength of Mind. Mind
becomes crippled. This will not happen through any
sadhana. Mind tells Atma that it wants to eat Mango. Mind
cannot eat the Mango but it makes Atma as the medium of
action. However, Sahib says- _'Maan Jata Hey Jane De,
Gahakey Rakh Sharir| Utara Pada Kaman Se, Kya Kar
Sakta Teer||'_ The power of Arrow is with the Bow. Arrow


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **137**
will be powerless without a Bow. Mind sustains on the
power of Atma. Mind will become inactive without the
power of Atma. Seated in darkness, Mind issues directions.
Every activity of Mind becomes evident. When you walk on
the path of thorn, you will remain alert. One with a Naam of
Satguru when becomes aware, he remains alert. He realizes
that if he does not remain alert, Mind will delude. _'Usko Kaal
Kya Karey, Jo Aath Pahar Hoshiyaar|_ ' It wants to remain with
the Surti. _'Kshan Sumirey, Kshan Bisarey, Yaha Toh Sumiran
Naahi| Aath Pahar Vina Rahey, Sumiran Soyi Kahayi||'_ If there
is a black Cobra in front of you, you will remain alert,
likewise you should be alert from Mind.To tell the truth,
you will realize that there is no greater enemy to you then
your own Mind. _'Tera Bairi Koi Nahi, Tera Bairi Mann|'_ You
will not take your attention away from your Mind. Mind
expects you to remain in ignorance of its working. When
you are alert on your Mind, you will remain Atma-centric
(Atmanistt) however not like a magician.
.....Therefore, You will remain in Pragya Awastha. You
will understand how entangled and immersed others are
with their Mind. _'Jagat Ki Nazar Mey Bhakt Gaya| Bhakt Ki
Nazar Mey Jagat Gaya||'_ Without the Naam, even billions of
your attempts will not bring improvement. Param purush
has told Kabir Sahib to take the Naam to the Jivas and
Mind's power will not work. That is why Mind fails to
dominate you.
Sahib says that with the Naam , the inner senses become
conscious. Then Atma does not get involve in Unatmic
activities. It does not interact with the external affair more
than necessary. It does not let Mind to involve in un-
necessary issues. This is the meaning of riding over Mind.
_'Maan Par Jo Asavar Hey, Aisa Birla Koy|'_ It will control
and rule over the four aspects of Mind. You can imagine the
level of attainment. Even the famous men of penance could
not control their Mind. Meera says- _'Sakhi Ri Mey Toh
Naam Ratan Dhan Paayo|'_ I will tell the location of Atma.


**138 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
You can realise your Mind. You have to be remain alert
with the Mind's prompting. Till the last moment, it's effort
will be to attack. When we feel that, we cannot live without
it, it refered as Sammohan. If you feel that you cannot live
without material object, it is Sammohan. Mind has force.
When Guru gives the power, Mind comes under control. All
the 24 hours, your Mind attacks on you. _'Chashme Dil Se
Dekh Tu, Kya Kya Tamashey Ho Rahe....|'_ The blow is on
the Atma. It continous this way or that way. Most
prominent personalities followed very difficult spiritual
practices, they reduced the body to skeleton, they took
Sanyas leaving their home, but they could not achieve
control over their Mind.
_Kitne Tapsi Tap Kar Darey, Kaya Dari Gaara|
Gruh Chhod Bhaye Sanyasi, Tou Na Pavat Paara||_
Mind is extremely strong; it is the cage of three lokas
(three worlds). _'Teen Lok Mey Manhi Viraji| Tehi Na
Chinhat Pandit Kazi||'_ Mind rules these three worlds.
However, after the Naamdan, the influence of the Mind
becomes weak. _'Maan Ke Chalaye Tan Chaley...|'_ Those
who are in the control of Mind, they will suffer destruction
extensively in life. Even after extremely difficult spiritual
practice, Mind does not come under control. Shringi Rishi
made his body like a wood; he thought if he refrains from
eating food, there would not be any formation of blood.
Without blood, sperms cannot be produced without which
there would not be a sexual urge. However, later he married
to a prostitute.
Mind is a form of Paramatma. There are thousand
names of Mind. However, that supreme lord is addressed as
Sahib, Satpurush by Kabir Sahibji. Veda describes that
Mind seated in the body is extremely subtle. However, after
the Naamdan, activities of the Mind can be cognized. When
the anger activates the Nadis, you will cognize it. The Evil
forces in the activity of the Mind can be recognized. If
somebody throws stone, you take notice of it and you step


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **139**
back. My Mind never prompts me to marry. It knows that I
will never do that. He never tells me to eat the meat; it
knows that I will not take. Mind entangles in this system of
inducement. There is no one who is the master of Mind.
_'Maan Par Jo Asavar Hey, Aisa Birla Koyi|'_
There was a conference on peace in Mumbai. In that
Dalai Lamaji, Shankaracharyaji, head of Christian church,
Jain Guru, and others were invited. In this connection, I was
also invited because I am a recipient of Mahatma Gandhi
medal of peace. I have attended. Increase in religious
conflict, violence and unrighteousness in the society
prompted a group of intellectuals to arrange such a
conference. They decided to call the leaders of the religion
and spirituality to seek answers and find remedial solutions
for the society to overcome this malice.
I was astonished to hear that some leaders suggesting
Mantra upasana, some suggested importance of getting up
early in the morning and maintainance of body cleanliness,
some suggested methodology of Yagna but nobody had a
proper fix for this malice in this society. Living aside this,
none of them knew the fundamental reason for such a
negative trend. I gave my speech. I had described the nature
and the qualities of Mind's family Vs Kam (desire), Krodh
(anger), Lobh (greed), Moh (attachment), Mada (pride);
they keep all humans in ignorance and drive them towards
unrighteousness (Adharma). When the medicine of Satya
Naam is administered then the power of wisdom overtakes
which will make them harmless to others. This is the only
formula. The chief organiser said in his speech "Listening to
Madhu Paramhansji, I have felt that Kabir Sahib has come
again on this Earth."
Will peace remain in you if you just wake up at four in
the morning. Non-vegetarian food makes one cruel nature.
How a tiger did received a cruel nature? It is by eating the
flesh. I spoke about the ways and means of remedy.

Taking birth and meeting death are nothing but Maya;
that real protector is none other than Sahib (Param Purush
of Amarlok-Eternal world), who never die; he never visits
these three worlds. People of the world, has taken Avatars
as the real Sahib. Kabir Sahib says that where is the need
for Matsya (Fish form), Kchap (Tortise form) and such
Avtars! If all are his children then why should he protect
some and kill others? That is why it is said that Supreme
Lord, Sahib did not kill Daitya Shankasur because he is
very compassionate, he has no enimity with anyone, all
Atmas are of his essence then whom to kill and whom to
trouble!!! These torcher and killings are not pleasant; these
are all cruel and violent actions. Therefore, this work is not


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **141**
of Sahibji. That Sahib did not appear as Varah (Pig form)
and as not lifted the land. Not all these are the activity of
Sahib but the world attributes these acts on the Supreme
Lord-Sahib. The one who came out breaking the pillar in
the form of Narsingha (Lion form), everyone has taken him
as real Sahib, but the one who tore the stomach of
Hiranyakashyapu with the fingernails is also not the real
Sahib. The one who taken a Dwarf form, approached Raja
Bali for a land of three steps is also not Sahib. That Sahib
(Param Purush) never asks for anything, he is the giver of
all. Therefore, the whole world is entangled in illusion
without proper enquiry; they have taken these Avatars as
the ultimate Purush. This way, the Nirakar Niranjan has
deluded the entire universe. That Supreme Lord, Sahib did
not appear as Parshuram for killing the Kshatriyas. This is
the wicked act of Maya. Without being aware of Satguru
Bhakti (Satya Bhakti), people have wasted their entire lives.
Further, he says that Sahib did not marry Sita. How can one
marry his own daughter! Nor does he build the bridge over
sea. It is foolishness to develop devotion to anyone without
proper enquiry. That Supreme Lord Sahib did not play with
the Gopis in the Gokul and did not kill Kans in the guise of
a sustainer. He is one of compassion and pure love, neither
he wins against someone nor loses to someone. He did not
appear as Buddha even, he did not kill the Rakshasas.
Without the knowledge of real Sahib (Param Purush),
people are deluded. Maya has put everyone in delusion. He
did not come in Kalki Avatar even; he did not kill the
people of Kalinga. All these wicked acts are done by Maya.
Kal Purush has destroyed Yogis, Men of penance, and Men
of truth. Just like a small kid satisfied by a toy Aircraft
when he actually demands for a real one, so does Maya
deludes Mahatmas and Mahapurushas with falsehood. All
the ten Avatars are nothing but projection of Maya by
Niranjan (this Niranjan is called as Paramatma or Ishwar by
the worldly people and Gurus, Sants address him as Kal


**142 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
Niranjan, Kal Purush, Nirakar Niranjan or Mind), whom the
entire worlds takes as the ultimate Sahib and eternal one.
Sahib says "Oh people of the world! Listen and enquire that
the one who is born with the body and dies, cannot be
Sahib, he is nothing but somebody else (Niranjan-Mind).
Kal Purush pleaded with Sahibji for running 12 false
panths in the name of Kabir Sahib by deluding the Jivas
because only in the Kaliyug, Sahib's naam will be given to
many Jivas and to be taken to Satlok. In the other three
Yugas, Sahibji takes very few people to Amarlok. In these
three Yugas, Niranjan himself comes as Avatars and like a
Hero of protection he deludes the Jivas. People get drowned
in this.

nearby. At the time, he felt that there was something below

Pitrulok it is 1 day. When Pitrulok completes 1 year, it is 1
day for Demi God (Devas). When 12 years of Devas are
completed, it is a time of 1 manu. When seven Manus die, it
is a time of 1 Indra. When 7 Indras dies, it is the time of 1
Brahma.
_Sapt Brahma Jab Vinshi, Tab Ek Vishnu Ko Nash||
Sapt Vishnu Jab Biti, Tab Ik Rudra Vinash||_
When 7 Brahma dies, it is the time of 1 Vishnu. When 7
Vishnu dies, 1 Shiva dies.
_Sora Rudra Gathi Jab Hoi| Tab Ik Rom Mam Parey Khasoi||
Tatey Lomas Naam Hai Mora|Kara Samadh Jitbey Hai Thora||_
Lomash Rishi said- When 16 Shivas dies, 1 hair of my
body is destroyed.
_Janiyo Janm Alp Jab, Chaley Swarg Asthaan||
Nirakar Niranjan, Tasu Marm Na Jaan||_


**144 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
When the truth of life was unrevealed by the Rishi in
front of him then Ramji gaveup his body in the Sharayu
river.
_Tyagiyo Rajpat Bandhu Chari|Gaye Swarg Nrup Sain Sidhari||
Aap Ichha Janm Pun Linha|Krishna Charitra Aagey Pun Kinha||

Jamraja Hai Ati Barbanda|Marei Brahma Vishnu Nau Khanda||
Kal Fas Kaisey Muktavey|Jab Lag Satyanaam Nahi Pavey||_
All the four brothers, gave up their body and attained the
heavens. Then again out of desire, he took the incarnation of
Krishna. Sahibji says the Ram whom the world shows
devotion, this was his condition. Many were killed. This Kal
is very violent, he even kills the Tridevas. Till Jiva gets the
Naam, it cannot get salvation from the world of Kal.
Further Sahib tells Dharmadas-
_Sunn Dharm Mey Tohi Sunaau|Krishna Charitra Ko Bhav Batau||_
Sahibji said, now I will tell you about Krishna avatar.
_Ek Nar Raghupati Dukh Paya|Sora Sahastra Gopi Nirmaya||

In Tretayug, Ramji suffered bereavement of a woman
therefore, in the Krishna avatar, there were creation of 16
thousand womens, and he himself had taken birth through
Devaki. When it came to the knowledge of Kans, he sent


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **145**
Kagasur, Putna, and other Daityas. Krishna as a child killed
them all.
_Bahu Krida Hari Kinha, Janat Nahi Na Koi||
Ajiya Putrahi Paliye, Aap Swarthy Hoi||_
This way, Krishna enacted Leelas in front of the world.
_Marat Tasu Var Na Lava|Esa Dekho Hari Swabhava||

Shishupal and other mighty and powerful enemies were
killed by him like goats. He had enacted the Leelas with
Gopis in front of world and he killed all those who were
sent by Kansa. Due to the devotion of previous lives of the
servent of Kansa- Kubri, Krishna gave her physical
satisfaction (Rati-Daan).
_Kans Maar Hari Gokul Gaheyu|Gopin Samadhan Hari Kiyeu||_
Then he killed kansa.
_Ek Bar Shishupal Bhuvara|Krishna Sey Kinha Jo Samar Apaara||

Sab Ke Dekhat Krishna Jo Khava|Tehu Na Bhujey Kal Swabhava||

So many were killed. Inspite of these acts, worldly
people were unable to recognize the attitude of Kalpurush.
The world has taken these killings as liberation given by the
Prabhu.
_Kal Saban Ko Grasyo, Vachan Kahyo Samuzai||
Kahey Kabir Mey Ka Karo, Dekh Nahi Patiyaai||_
Sahib says Kal Purush seizes all, kills and devours them.
How to make them understand? No one is willing to listen.
_Jyo Nari Piya Ko Vrath Tajai|Dujey Ju Prem Preeti So Bajai||
Taiso Dekho Yaha Sansaara|Naam Bina Kimi Uthre Para||_


**146 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
This is similar to a woman giving up her chastity of her
husband and run to other man, people instead of developing
devotion to Param Purush Sahib, they are devoted to Kal
Purush. Without the Satya Naam, how can they attain
salvation!
_Bhul Pari Sab Duniya, Pakhand Key Vyavhar||
Mool Chaadi Daarey Gahey, Kaisey Utarey Paar||_
The Whole World Is Mislead By Hypocrites And Instead Of
Holding The Root, They Are Holding The Branches; Then
How Can They Get Liberation!
_Tab Hari Kinhey Charit Apaara|So Ab Bhako Agil Vyavhara||

Then Krishna created a great wonder. The five Pandavas
served him with lots of devotion. Then he has created
enimity between Pandavas and Kauravas. All were killed,
nobody can understand. Ganga's son Bhishma, Karan, etc
were killed in a wicked manner.
_Pancho Pandav Bachi Rahey, Au Bhujo Sab Jhaar||
Dharmarai As Kinha, Krishna Pari Hankaar||_
Except Pandavas, all others were killed. All these were
the play of Kal Purush. Then Niranjan has summoned
Krishna.
_Chal Bhaye Krishna Swarg Asthana|Shunya Adi Jaha Shish Nahi

Then Krishnaji travelled to void space where neither sun
nor moon exist. He travelled much beyond even Vaikuntha
and offered his salutation to Adi Niranjan and asked
Niranjan as to what he wish? Then the voice spoke from the
sky "You have been sent to world to bring it down, for the
destruction of Asuras.
_Marhu Yadav Vansh Kaha, Mano Vachan Rasaal||
Gopi Jaai Sanharo, Tehi Panchey Tuv Kal||_
Niranjan asked Krishna to destroy the Yadavas and also
the Gopikas and to finish them all.
_Krishna Kahey Sunu Purush Purana|Kal Abhey Kaha Mor Thikana||_
Krishnaji said- What is my position in front of
Kalpurush?
_Te Mam Ansh Mohi Mey Basa|Kal Rup Sansaar Nivasa||

Jajo Krishna Ab Baig Sharira|Aaye Atra Ab Das Kabira||_
Niranjan told Krishna that he is his essence and had
taken the duty of Kal. Kill the sinners by any means; even
by wickedness or by deception. The lifespan of Kaliyug is
very short therefore return quickly sacrificing your body
because Kabir Sahib is going to appear.
_Sun Kiyo Krishna Achambho, Kaiso Das Kabir||
So Mohi Swami Kahab Sab, Tab Mey Tajo Sharir||_
Hearing the name of Kabir Sahib, Krishnaji wondered.
Krishnaji asked – Who is this Kabir Sahib? Tell me, only
then I will sacrifice my body.
_Kali Anek Raj Hai Mora|Kaliyug Narhi Avadhi Hai Thora||

Niranjan said, in the Kaliyug, lifespan of Human being
are very short. Pandavas will conduct a Yagya in which all
Rishis and alike will participate. However, Yagya will not
complete even if they all pertake the offering of food
because none of them knows the benefit of Naam. In the
Kaliyug, Kabir will come in the form of Human. Through
his disciple Supach, the Yagya will be fulfilled. You have
killed Vali during Ram avatar therefore he will take birth as
a hunter. Let him take revenge on you so that world will not
have doubt (Karmakand). After listening to Kal, Krishnaji
returned to Dwaraka.
As directed by Niranjan, he got the Yagya done by
Pandavas. It was performed due to killing of Kinsman.
Krishnaji instructed for serving food.
_Baithey Gandharva Dev Gan, Rishi Munivar Sab Jhar||
Sab Mili Kinha Bhojan, Icha Ke Anusaar||_
All the Rishis and Munis partaken food to their
satisfaction.
_Bhojan Bhaye Ghant Baja|Rai Yudhishthir Ko Bhayi Laja||

_Baithey Supach Tahi So Kahai|Nirgun Bhakt Yaha Koi Rahayi||
Kahey Supach Nirgun Ko Jano|Satguru Mahima Sada Bakhano||_
All have taken the taken the food including Krishna
however the bell did not ring to indicate satisfactory
conclusion of Yagya therefore, Raja Yudhishthir felt sense
of Shame. Krishnaji told to look for a devotee who sings the
glory of Satguru. Bring him with all reverence and offer
him food. Listening to Krishna, Yudhishthir sent a
messenger to look for a devotee of Satguru but they could
not locate anyone. Then Bhima went on search and reached
Kashi and he saw a devotee named Supach. Supach spent
all the time singing the glory of Satguru.
_Kahey Bheem Sun Harijan, Kripa Karo Mam Sanga||
Chalo Jaha Hari Baithey, Swami Baal Govinda||_
Bhima addressed him- Oh Harijan! Be graceful, come to
the place of Prabhu Hari.
_Kahey Supach Prabhu Kaisey Kahau|Kalhi Jaan Krishna

Supach enquires as to how can he call him as Prabhu!
and said all are form of Kal. Listening to this, Bhima got
irritated and walked away abusing him. On return, he told
Krishnaji, for the fear of you, I did not kill him.Listening to
Bhima, Krishnaji smiled.
_Jiv Yudhishthir Ved Gey, Tum Aano Gahi Pai||
Agya Manic Hale Tab, Aye Yudhishthir Rai||_
Then Krishnaji asked Yudhishthir to go and request.
Following his command, he went to Supach.
_Aho Sant Tajiye Apradha|Adham Udaran Suniyat Sadha||
Chalo Swami Mere Graham Aaju|Kripa Karo Mam Hovey Kaju||

He pleaded with Supach to forgive him for the mistake
and requested Supach to grace his house which will benefit
his family. Supach asked- Oh King of Pandav, what work
do you have? Yudhishthir said- You are a Paramarthi
(Spiritualist) therefore I am confident that you will come
and grace us. Pleased with the Yudhishthir, Supach went
along with him, King Yudhishthir washed the feet of
Supach and served him with five varities of food. When
Supach pertook the meal and just stood up, the bell rang
indicating the successful completion of the Yagya. After
which completion of Yagya, Krishna reached Dwaraka.
_Buzo Rey Nar Parani, Kya Supchai Adhikar||
Gan Gandharva Muni Dev Rishi, Sab Mili Kinha Ahaar||_
Oh Men! What is the uniqueness of Supach, when he
pertook the food, the yagya was fulfilled. The bell did not
ring even when Gan-Gandharv, Muni, Devta, Rishi and
Krishna pertook the food.
_Sab Ke Khaye Ghant Nahi Baja|Dharma Kid Eh Yudhishthir Raja||

Supach Jan Bhal Nam Prabhau|Tathey Puran Yagya Karau||

When they all took the food, the bell did not rang
because none of them knew the greatness of Naam. Supach
knew the greatness of Naam therefore when he took the
food, the Bell rang and the Yagya was complete. The world
is devoted to Krishna and others, but Oh wise ones,
understand our "Naam". No one can escape without Satya
Naam.

Krishnji called Arjuna and asked to bring all Gopikas for

Mathura. Arjuna took his bow and left to bring them. Then
Krishna couldn't prevent them killing eachother.

The Bali was killed in the Tretha Yug by Rama, In the
Dwapar yug, to take the revenge, he came as a Hunter and
killed Krishna. The Yadavas and Gopikas, all of them died.
_Kahey Krishna Sun Arjun, Chado Yahi Sansara||

Relinquishing their country to their son Parikshit,
Pandavas went to the place where Krishna was there. Four
Pandavas left their body on the way itself, only Yudhishthir
could reach. Krishna gave up his body, he has repaid his
debt for killing Shishupal too.

harms another person, who can protect him! The ten
incarnation passes but however, no one is able to
comprehend the game of Kalpurush.

runs for many Eons (Kalpas) then how does he recreate?
Tell me the secrete behind creation and dissolution which
will clear my doubts.

Like a Waterwheel, the four Yugas go in cycle. After the
four Yugas, Niranjan brings shower of Fire. Then with the
water, he submerges the world. In this, the Heavens, the 33
crores of Gods and DemiGods and Men of penance are not
affected. This way, the four Yugas (72 Choukadi) passes.
Niranjan creates and destroys. He enjoys the rulership due
to the boon received from Param Purush.
_Maha Parlay Jab Kiya Niranjan Agni Sweth Na Raho||

When Niranjan brings Maha Pralaya (Great dissolution),
Sun, Moon, Fire, Water, etc. none of them remains. Then
Lomash Rishi also dies. All the four elements merges into
Akash tattva. Maya- Adishakti is also gets merged in
Niranjan. This way, Niranjan consumes every one. Nothing
remains. He keeps all the Jivas in himself.

Sahibji says- Those who have the grace of Satguru
escapes from this and reaches their true home Amarlok with
the help of Naam. Otherwise, he eats all and approaches
Param Purush for recreation. Whether they are devoted to
Kalpurush or not, he consumes all. Under such conditions,
we cannot understand whose glory Veda is singing! People
persue Veda but they are unable to comprehend this secret.
_Jehi Ko Bharosa Soi Churavey Kaho Tab Kaisey Baney|

**154 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
_Adi Ant Sabhi Grasey As Niranjan Raai Ho||_
If the person on whom we have trust, steals then whom
to believe! This way, the Jivas show devotion to Kalpurush
only to be consumed ultimately by him. Even when the
evidence are there, they fail to recognize. I have told that
Niranjan will consume everyone but all are unable to
understand it.
_Kal Saban Ko Khay, Hari Har Brahma Se Basey|
Baachey Kaun Upaai, Ek Naam Janey Bina||_
He does not leave even Hari, Brahma, and Shiva.
Without that one Satya Naam, no one can escape.

## 14.Who is Satguru?

Giving the identification of a Real Satguru, Kabir Sahib
tells Dharmadas-
_Bhrunga Mata Hoy Jehi Paasa| Soi GuruSatya Dharmadasa||_
Sahib says the one who has Bhrunga Mata is a Real
Guru - a true Satguru. What is Bhrunga Mata? There are 27
Lakhs, kinds of Insects; Bhrunga is unique among them.
They have only male form, they have no female. How do
they procreate? It creates a Mud House. There is a
miraculous effect in his sound. It flies very fast. They catch
hold of any Larvae of insect, keeps the Larva in the mud
house and transmits its sound; its sound is very endearing.
With this sound, it transforms the Larvae into a Bhrunga,
like itself. If the Larva does not concentrate, it cannot
transform. Then Bhrunga takes off, returns after sometime,
and again transmit its sound. If the Larva fails again, again
it goes around and comes back and tansmits its sound third
time. If the Larva concentrates, it can transform into another
Bhrunga but if it fails then Bhrunga will discard it. It
remains as an insect and not as Bhrunga. It will bring
another Larve and start over the whole process again.
Satguru does the same work. Satguru also with his Surti
(Concentration) transforms his disciple like himself. The


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **155**
Larvae does not need to do any activity. It is the Bhrunga
which brings it, keeping in the mud house, Bhrunga itself
transmits the sound. The Larvae has to only co-operate
through concentration on sound. If it does not heed, how
can it transform?
Sahib says-
_Bhrungi Shabd Kitt Jo Mana|Varan Pher Aapan Kar Jana||_
The Larvae, which concentrates on the sound of
Bhrunga, gives up his own form and transform itself into a
Bhrunga. If a Larvae is of a Tumblebug (Gubraila) will give
it's nature and become a Bhrunga; if it is a Larvae of Wasp
(Tataiya), it will give up it's habits and nature, and
transform into a Bhrunga.
_Koi Koi Kitt Param Sukhdaai|Pratham Awaz Gahe Chitlayi||_
Some Larve are very comfortable. It absorbes the sound
in the very first instant from Bhrunga and transforms into a
Bhrunga itself.
_Koi Dujey Koi Tijey Maney|Tan Man Rahit Shabd Hitt Janey||_
Some absorbes in the second or third attempt. Some
have difficulties in the first attempt but they may succeed in
the second or third attempt.
_Bhrungi Shabd Kitt Na Gahayi|Tau Puni Kitt Asarey Rahai||_
But that Larva which did not absorb the sound of
Bhrunga even on the third attempt may be out of fear will
remain as an insect and not as Bhrunga.
_Gurushabd Nishchay Satya Maney, Bhrungi Mat Tab Pavai|
Taji Sakal Aasa Shabd Baasa, Kaaga Hansa Kahavai||_
In the same way, Satguru is a bestower of Blissful
transformation. There is a frequency in the bhu- bhu sound
of Bhrunga. Some Larve could not transform itself in the
first attempt. Why it is so? Because, it has not surrendered
itself. Its not an ordinary surrender. Till the time it
surrenders and atunes to the sound of Bhrunga, it cannot
transform. If it fails in three attempts, bhrunga gives it up
and searches for another Larve of insect.
_Toh Puni Kitt Aasarey Rahai...||_


**156 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
_Pahale Data Shishya Bhaya, Jin Tan Man Arpa Sheesh|
Pichey Data Satguru Bhaya, Jin Naam Daya Bakshish||_
Everybody claims of Sahaj marg and asked for
accumulation of Merit. These are the two sides. Sahib says
that you don’t have to do anything, all will be done by
Satguru's grace; all will be given automatically- Spiritual
wisdom, Devotion, Control on Mind, Ruhaniyat and the
powers. You may ask that how is it possible without self-
effort. After the Naam diksha, who presides over the
individuality 'I'? It is the power of Satguru which sustains it.
Therefore, don’t keep the feeling 'I' and 'Mine'. Be humble
and submit to Satguru.
A man said that whatever happens is by the grace of
Guru, if so, then all the wicked and fraud activity we
commit is also by grace of Guru. I told him- Listen, I will
give the complete answer. This happens if we completely
surrender, then even if you wish, you cannot commit a sin.
Now you follow in the faith of God, your destiny disturbes
your state. You reap as per your action. Know that if you
are destined to fall into ditch, you will definately do so. If
you rely on your Satguru completely then Satguru will
deflect away the effect of past Karma. The event will be
cancelled.
_Koti Karam Pal Mey Katey, Jo Aavey Guru Ott||_
Whatever action you perform and the loss you may
encounter, Guru's protective intervention will always be
there with you. Whatever happens will be ultimately for
your own good. Therefore, whether it is good or otherwise it
is always for your betterment. Take it as grace of Satguru. It
means, all will be done by him and you are not the doer.
_Surti Karo Mam Saeiya, Hum Hey Bhavjaal Maahi|
Aap Hi Hum Baha Jayengey, Jo Na Gahogey Baahi||_
Kabir Sahibji indicates that Satguru will immediately
change your predictment. How it is done? He will transform
you into himself (sway away). That is why it is said that you
do not have to go circumblating.


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **157**
In this world, there are so many Gurus who promise you,
about liberation but when you look at them, there is no
evidence of transformation. It means they are not the real
Gurus. Therefore, Sahib says-
_Bhrunga Mata Hoy Jihi Paasa| Soi Guru Satya Dharmadasa||_
Just like the Bhrunga transforms the larva of an insect
without any effort on the part of Larva. Similarly, the
disciple will be transformed by Satguru without any effort
on disciple part.
Don’t you observe the manifestation of your own
characteristics in your children! They are your seed cell
(shukranu). The concentration of Satguru reaches up to the
Atma (Soul) of disciple. Through this concentration- Surti,
all are transmitted effortlessly and easily (Sahaj marg).
Then the Desire, Lust, and Anger will not be effective.
Sahib talks about such a Satguru who has the competence of
Bhrunga. _'Guru milney se Zagda khatam ho gaya||'_ The
battle is won when you get the real Satguru. The search for
the spiritual attainment comes to an end. In the path of
yoga, this is not possible.
What is Sahaj Marg? Guru takes the total responsibility.
Your attachment and desires will keep reducing; your inner
vices will begin to disappear. A security guard (Satguru)
will stand by you always. It becomes like _'Mera Hari
Mauko Bhajey, Mey Sou Pauv Pasaar||_ ' This is Sahaj marg.
You need not do any Sadhana. This is Bhrunga mata.
_Guru Ko Kijey Dandawat, Koti Koti Pranaam|
Kitt Na Janey Bhrunga Ko, Kariley Aap Saman||_
People are in confusion as to what course to take. People
are talking about various Sadhanas. You cannot overcome
Maya Shakti (power of Illusion) on your own effort. The
Satya Naam of Satguru will accomplish this for you.
The one who directs you to do some Sadhana or earn
merits by recitation is not a real Sant. He is an hypocrite in
the guise of a Sant, who has no real practical experience. He
speaks based on his bookish knowledge. Sant has


**158 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
competence but others are incompetent (Adhyatmically).
Sant Satguru speaks as a realised witness while others speak
with the bookish knowledge. Sant satguru practically return
from Amarlok, others have not seen Amarlok not even in
their dreams. If they have seen in the dream, it is not by
their effort, it is on somebody else's mercy. It is true that
one cannot see Amarlok even in his dreams. Then there is
absolutely no chance for reaching to Amarlok.Therefore, a
Guru who does not have Bhrunga mata with him will be a
burden to you, because they are misleading all into delution.
Keep this word imbibed in your heart that he is pushing you
into a path of total destruction; if he is directing you into
Sadhanas and Kamaai (Earning Merits and Yog Sadhana are
only for physical and mental well-being and not for the
benefit of Atma). Because these hypocrites doesn't know
that ----
_Na Kuchh Kiya Na Kari Saka, Na Karney Yog Sharir|
Jo Kuchh Kiya Sahib Kiya, Bhaya Kabir Kabir||_
The one who directs you towards meritorious actions for
Spiritual advancement; he would have pursued the same
path. This means that he has never seen the Amarlok- The
eternal world of Parampurush. His Guru also would not
have been a Sant Satguru. If it was to be a Satguru, then he
will not be directing to Sadhana and Kamaai and his
mission is not of a Sant Matt. Nowhere it can be a Bhrung
Mat. He is a bogus Guru, the one who is drowning you in
the worldly ocean of life along with himself. His aim is to
earn fame and wealth, your salvation is not his concern.
In our country, Naam initiation is accomplished with the
Guru's palm placed on the head of the disciple. Some
devotees say that their Guru has given Naam through a mike
and speaker system, some say that they received through a
television. No, this is not the correct way of Naam Diksha.
A man asked me if you have to give Naam Diksha to
thousands of people at a time, will you follow the same
procedure like keeping your hand on disciple’s head.I


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **159**
replied- Yes, I will. If the number of people exceed to
Lakhs then also I will follow the same procedure, because
the rules of Naam Diksha is so. It has to be conducted in
that manner. This is the system of Naam Daan. It is a matter
of transmitting rays of Adhyatmic power by touch, contact.
An alcoholic person came to me. It was sometime back
that he gave up liquor and requested me for Naam Daan. I
adviced him to exercise restraint on liquor for sometime and
then to come back later. Later, he took Naam Daan from
some other Guru, he started accusing his Guru saying that
he gave him Naam Daan when he was fully drunk. Is it the
way to give Naam Diksha! He said that he was not
conscious of anything. Means, Guru did not know anything
about the Shishya. It is said- _'Paani Pijiye Chhan Ke, Guru
Kijiye Jaan Key||'_ His Guruji is engaged in the process of
increasing number of disciples. I am cautioning the society
against such person who does not know anything about his
disciples. If a Guru is unaware about your Merits and
Demerits, know that he cannot help you in your attainment.
When Kal arrives to take your Atma, such Guru will not
know his arrival and he may push you into difficult
conditions. Such hypocrite Gurus cannot save you from the
Yama- Kalpurush. Therefore, one has to search for a
complete Guru- Satguru. One should remember the words
of Kabir Sahib-
_Bhrunga Mata Hoy Jihi Paasa| Soi Guru Satya Dharmadasa||_

_Sar shabad satguru se pavey, kshar akshar ke poara.
Abb bhaya re guru kai bachha, abb pakka re pakka._
He says that a devotee will become a perfect one only when he
gets blessed with the holy Naam. It means the enemies within us
are powerful and they can’t be controlled by any other means
except a true Naam.

## 15. Satguru gave me a unique herb.

_Koti Naam Sansar Mey, Tintey Mukti Na Hoy|
Mool Naam Jo Gupt Hey, Janey Virla Koy||_
In this mortal world, there are many religious scriptures
written by their Gurus, it contains crores of Words-Sounds,
which can be easily read and written. However, none of
them has the power to grant permanent Mukti beyond great
disolution. The Sanjivan Naam, which was refered by Kabir
Sahib, is unique and secretes Naam, which is not the subject
of any Granth or Text. That Satya Naam is received only
from Sant Satguru, rare is such a person who realises it.
Sants of Sant Mat say that Satya Naam, which has the
power to free the Atma from Niranjan Mind and Maya, is
Param Purush Sahib himself. That Naam cannot be written
or spoken, worldly people take it as a Naam, which can be
spoken and written. This ignorance in them is created by the
Gurus of Worldly Dharmas. Therefore, worldly people are
unable to grasp the essence of Satya Naam. This Sar Shabd
or Sanjeevan Naam is available only with Satgurus of Sant
Mat of Kabir Sahib.
Sant Mat proclaims that without this Sar Shabd, no one
can attain Mukti from Sansar Sagar (Worldly Ocean of life).
It also says the right to bestow the Sanjeevan Naam remains
only with the Real Satguru of Sant Mat in this creation.
The world is crowded with Teachers of Dharma, Gurus,
Yogis and self proclaimed Sants, without understanding the
secrete behind the power of Satya Naam and without
realisation of the same; they are initiating people with
Bodily Naam which are impermanent. All are mixing up the
ideology of Sant Mat of Satguru Kabir Sahib with Sagun or
Nirgun form of worship, mixing the same with the names of
Paramatma of this World. They imitate the Sant Mat and its
practices in initiating the people with perishable Naam.


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **161**
Imitating the form of a Sants, they claim that they have
Sanjeevan Naam to release the people from the worldly
oceans of life. In this manner, the self-proclaimed Gurus
entangled the worldly people in the initiation of Sagun and
Nirgun Bhakti and its perishable Names. The Nirakar Yog
revolves around five names; it manifests from the energy
centers of body. The Naam-Sounds of the religious
scriptures are of creation, perishable, and are of Siddhis of
Five elements.
As per as the Sthul (Physical-Gross) Yoga, it is
connected with different seating postures (Asanas) and
Mudras. This will help in maintaining a healthy body. This
yoga has no connection with Atma or Param Purush Sahib.
Sukshma (Subtle) Yog is based on Dhyan-Meditation. In
this, one concentrates on any one of the Chakras within the
body and experiences bright white, yellow, golden glow,
jyoti, or Anhad Dhun. Dhyan is the master key (Surti) to
open these seven energy centers-Chakras.
Sthul and Sukshma Yogas are limited upto the level of
Mind only. With these, one cannot transcend the worldly
existence, which is the creation of Mind itself (Mano
Moolam Idam Jagatu).
_Rishi Muni Tridev Adi Ley, Panch Shabd Mey Atkey|
Mudra Sadh Rahe Ghat Bhitar, Phir Ondhey Muh Latkey||_
Above all these Yoga of creation and disolution is the
unique Naam of Param Purush which can be illumined with
the grace of Satguru with his Paras Surti. It is different from
Yog Sadhana. That Satguru Shabd tatva which takes one to
Satlok cannot be obtained without his grace. That 11th door
which Sahib has revealed to the Sant is different from the
10th door (Sahastrasar), the 11th door enables one to attain
permanent blissfull liberation of Atma. This path is known
as Vihangam Marg or Chaal, Sahib says-
_Nau Dwarey Sansaar Sab, Dasvey Yogi Saadh|
Ekadashi Khidki Bani, Janat Sant Sujan||
Panch Shabd Auh Pancho Mudra, Soyi Nishchay Mana|_


**162 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
_Agey Puran Purush Puratan, Taki Khabar Na Jana||_
Where from this unique medicine (Satya Naam) came,
Kabir sahib and Sants described this Akaha-Nirakshar
(indescribable by alphabets), Videha Shabd (it is a
soundless, bodiless sound) and said:
_Shabd Videha Bhayo Ucchara| Tihi Pichhey Trilok Pasara|
Shabdh Hi Naam Lok Kahe Bhai|Nirakshar Mey Rahe Samzaai||_
In his blissful resolve, the formless Purusha (Sahib)
manifested himself with a word. That bodiless word
manifested as a strange brilliance of light, which is called
Amarlok (Eternal world). This means Param Purush himself
took the form of light. That indescribable word-'Naam' is
the 'Satya Naam' of Amarlok. The indescribable word of the
formless Satya Purush arised out of his wish and took the
form of Amarlok. That soundless sound assumed the form
of Satlok and merged in indescribable Satya Naam.
That secret Naam- 'Saar Shabd' which is indescribable
Chetan Shakti- cannot be spoken, read and written with
alphabet, is itself is the Satguru. With the grace of Satguru,
this unique medicine remains in you, will create a unique
power in you. Your Surti- Concentration will merge in the
Surti of Satguru and transcend the worldly ocean of Life.
Establishing himself in you, he did not engage you in Pooja-
Sacrificial offerings. Sahibji says-
_Na Kuchh Kiya Na Kar Saka, Na Karney Yog Sharir|
Jo Kuchh Kiya So Sahib Kiya, Bhaya Kabir Kabir||_
Satguru with the grace of touch of Paras Surti bestows
fundamental super consciousness (Mool Chetna). A real
Satguru will not ask a disciple to practice Shabd Kamaai
(Recitations) and Shabd Abhyaas (Rememberance of
Sound). The meditation on Satguru itself is the door to
salvation. ( _'Dhyan Moolam, Guru Roopam| Moksha
Moolam, Guru Kripa||'_ ). The unique medicine (Satya
Naam) received by the grace of Satguru, activates the super
consciousness, and enables Atma to reach its abode
'Amarlok'.


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **163**
If only Atma is immediately released from the body on
receiving the Satya Naam, then your family and relation
will call me as a Murderer because all are slave of Mind,
they are encircled by Kal Purush. If they die out of fear then
no one will come to me for Naam Daan- Initiation. They
will run saying that Satguru is putting to death at the time of
Naam Daan itself.
_"Hai Yaha Satguru Bina Koi, Moksha Ka Daata Nahi|"_
It is not a simple statement that "It is no one but a
Satguru, who is a giver of salvation." He gives the 'Sajeev
Naam' ( a unique medicine). It is out of world and free of
elements. That Naam protects and keeps you alert. on
receiving the Naam, your power of spiritual discrimination
(Vivek) enhances because without this true Naam, a
concentration is blind. Your ignorance is due to the
darkness which pervaides your Heart. Darkness produces
ignorance. with the Satya Naam, you can comprehend the
arising of Kam (desire), Krodh (anger), Lobh (greed), Moh
(attachment), Mada (pride). You can also identify your own
transformation.
_Guru Bina Hriday Shudh Nahi Hoi|Kotin Bhanti Karey Jo Koi|_
Illumining your inner senses (Antakaran) cannot be
accomplished without a grace of Satguru. With the Naam
initiation, you will be able to pursue the arising of inner
enimies and to discriminate sins and merits. Surti is subdued
due to the influence of Mind and Maya. By relighting the
superconsiousness of Atma, it can reach its abode –
Amarlok. To rise this super consciousness, Sants have
propagated Surat-Yog instead of Physical- Yog to enhance
the power of Surti (concentration). They have asked to
meditate on Satguru with one- pointed concentration.
_Nirakshar Ki Parchay Hoi|Tab Satyalok Pahunchey Hai Soi||
Jivit Lok Baith Puni Aai|Sar Shabd Mey Rahey Samaai||_
The one who gains by realising that which is
indescribable by alphabets only can attain eternal Satyalok


**164 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
through that Sar Shabd again. In the Satya Sar Shabd
Satlok, Atma merges with the grace of Satguru.
_Akah Naam Akshar hey bhai| Tum Niakshar raho samayi||
Ni-akshar ko karey nibera| Kahe Kabir soyi jan mera||_
With the grace of Satguru, Jiv merges in the Sar Shabd
while living and gains the knowledge of Amarlok. In the
Amarlok, Hansa (Atma) has the brilliance is equivalent to
16 thousand Suns. That world cannot be described in words
that are a Bodiless Naam (You hear and realise it in the
Surti not with the physical senses).
_Parampurush aru kaal key, Madhya mey satguru dham|
Shabd kid or dharay kar, devai avichal naam||_
It is the Satguru, who holds the rope of Shabd. This
Shabd ultimately helps Jiva to attain its Amardham. Seated
in the Sound, Atma moves up witnessing the creation and
existence of world. That Sound enables the vision with
which Atma moves observing all. It is different from the
imagination. That sound of the Satguru converses on the
way. That experience bliss is indescribable. If one can
describe it, it means that he has not experienced it. " _jo
suney so kahey nahi, kahe so suntan nahi_ |" Bliss can only be
perceived and it cannot be explained or narrated.
.....That sound pulls upward all the while discussing,
reaches the world of Sahib.
_Surti shabd mey jortey, khuley gagan kivar|
Jagmag jagmag ho raha, parampurush darbar||_
Earlier the Mind seated in you got all the work done
through you, but after the Naam Daan, Satguru takes his
seat and helps you to regulate your thought, word, and
deeds. Therefore, the disciple of Satguru should does not
have the feeling that he is the doer.
_Aap hi kanda taul taraju, aap hi taulan hara|
Aap hi levey aap hi devey, aap hi hey banjara||_
Before meeting the Satguru, all things are done by the
Paramatma of this universe, through you. He is the creator,
Kalpurush. Without the Satya Naam, it was the rular of the


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **165**
world, who accomplished all through you. He is also known
as Leeladhar-An actor of Drama. Assume that one should be
murdered and then Mind seated in his enemy will
accomplish the murder of that person. It will direct the
intellect of that person to carry out that murder. In the same
way, Mind accomplishes both meritorious and sinfull deeds
through people. He does not realise that he is being utilised
as an instrument in the act. He totally unaware about the
manifestation of Greed, due to which he steals. All are
associated with one or other religious Dharmas. Yet they are
engaged in sinfull deeds. What does it shows and why do
this happen?
Satguru has the Satya Bhakti, which is free from the
connection of deeds. After receiving the secrete Naam,
Satguru takes control over you. Whatever may be your
condition before the Naam Daan; you will be reformed and
transformed. You will loose your interest on this world.
You will be able to control Kam (desire), Krodh (anger),
Lobh (greed), Moh (attachment), Mad (pride). The Satya
Naam will save you from all the bad promptings. All you
need is to surrender to the Satguru; you will be free from
sinfull action and will become a seeker of truth
(Paramarthi).
_Guru Bin Bharam Na Chhutey Bhai, Koti Upay Karey Chaturayi|
Guru Bin Hom Yagya Jo Sadhey, Auro Man Dash Patak Bandhey||
Satguru Miley Toh Agam Batavey, Yum Ki Anch Taahi Nahi Aavey|
Guru Sidhi Chadhi Upar Jayi, Sukhsagar Mey Rahey Samayi||_
Only a Satguru thinks about Mukti of the Jivas of this
world. Devi-Devtas satisfies only the desires of the Mind,
and helps in Sankalp (thought)-Vikalp (resolve) and for the
fulfillment of the desire, they advocate worship and
devotion. All these are done for the Mind. Men of penance
and Rishis with their Sadhanas, whatever they perceived in
their mansion of their body; they have described it in the
form of Mantras. It is only a Satguru, who releases the Jiva
from the clutches of Maya and Mind with the Saar Shabd


**166 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
because he is different from Sagun and Nirgun Bhakti. The
world of Satguru, Amarlok, which is beyond 21 worlds, is
unique.
My disciples who have taken up Satguru Bhakti are free
from effect of Karma. They do not have to face their
consequences of Karmas of past. Till the time one gets Real
Satguru, he is considered as a Jiva without a Guru. The only
requirement is have a complete faith in his Satguru. Then
what remains is one entity in two forms. There is no power
that can separate them in these three Worlds. Satguru
succeeds in taking the disciple with the thread of Satya
Naam to the world of Param Purush, Amarlok. For a true
disciple, Satguru is higher than the Gods.

## 16. Satguru has the surti yog.

There are unique powers within the Surti-Concentration.
The eighth Chakra (1 and 1/4 hand height high above the
head) is the Surti Kamal. It is the seat of Param Purush. In
the Surti, the power of self is present. Just like there is a
power in Banknal (Dun), Agya and Sahastrasar Chakra,
similarly Surti has power. With Sadhana and Yoga, one can
attain Siddhis. Dhyan is the key for every action. It is the
Dhyan, which opens up the Mudras, Chakras through
Yogas. It is with the Dhyan, one perceives the experiences.
The key to open up the Surti is different from the above.
With the Dhyan or Surti, one can open up the energies of
Chakras and Mudras. However, Surti (Dhyan) itself
contains unique powers. This is the secrete which the
followers of Sagun and Nirgun Bhakti do not realise.
As one concentrates on the eighth Chakra, the seat of
Satguru, the power of Surti begins to manifest with his
grace. Connecting with the Surti of Satguru, the Surti of the
disciple unravels its fundamental devotion. They
comprehend the game of Mind. The hidden secretes of Surti
begins to reveal itself. In that state of disciple, Satguru


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **167**
reveals the game of the vices of Mind (Desire-Anger-
Greed,etc.) and its family of 25 characteristics of body with
their Trigunas (Satwa, Rajo and Tamo). As the Surti is fixed
in the Ashta Kamal, one experience bliss of nectare while
living. Therefore, a complete Adhyatmic Guru is absolutely
essential.
_Alakh Purush Ki Arasi Santan Karey Deh|
Lakha Jo Chahey Alakh Ko Inhi Mey Lakh Leh||_
A real Guru will not leave a disciple alone with the
instruction on learning and practices. He remains and moves
with him. To keep my disciple alert and aware, to keep free
from the delusion and to keep them in Surti; I travel around
giving Satsang. As per the instruction of my Guru, I travel
to the States, Districts, and Towns and build Ashrams for
Satsang with the help of my disciples.
Only the Naam of Satpurush from the Satguru can take
you across the world of Kalpurush. This Naam itself is
Satguru-Soundless Sound. On this Sahibji says-
_Na Kuchh Kiya Na Kar Saka, Na Karne Yog Sharir|
Jo Kuchh Kiya To Sahib Kiya, Bhaya Kabir Kabir||_
That is why, I repeatedly say without any Ego or Pride
that "The thing I possess cannot be found anywhere else in
the universe."
_"Jo Vastu Mere Pas Hey, Brahmand Mey Kahi Nahi Hey|"_
A person asked me that "you state you have that power
which cannot be found anywhere in the universe, please
give me evidence." I told him that "It is not the power which
I am talking about, it is the thing (Vastu)." Pay attention on
words.
It is like a shopkeepers claim that the Jaggery, which he
is keeping, cannot be found anywhere else. He was saying
that the Jaggery is from unique and strange place. Similarly,
the thing that I am talking about does not belongs to this
universe; it is not from these three worlds, it is from the
fourth world-Amarlok. When I bestow that thing to an


**168 |** S a hi b B a n d g i
individual during Naam Dan-Initiation, three changes occur
in that particular individual.
(1) Atma and Mind are separated.
(2) The attraction of the world comes to an end.
(3) He gets a complete security.
At the time, when he comes to me, his earlier
individuality comes to an end. I have transformed him into a
nectarine individual (Madhumay). From then on, his
thoughts and discrimination will be in synchronisation with
me. He will not feel driven by his father and mother.
Sometime the parents say the son is not good and we do not
understand his behavior but I transform my disciple like
myself with my Surti.
For this reason, Sant Mat is also known as Bhrunga
Mata.
_Guru Samana Sishya Mey, Sishya Liya Kar Neh|
Bilgaye Bilgey Nahi, Ek Roop Do Deh||_
Keep your Surti, one pointedly on Satguru. The easiest
and simplest way is to keep your Dhyan one pointedly on
the Atma Shakti (Surti and Nirati). With this, one can
succeed in overcoming the vices of the outgoing Mind.
Without a Grace of Real Satguru, no one can comprehend
the activities of Mind i.e.Kam (desire), Krodh (anger), Lobh
(greed), Moh (attachment), and Mada (pride)). Any Sadhak
cannot comprehend the importance and greatness of Surti
Yog because Mind has no role here. The Surti Yog received
through a Satguru is a real Adhyatmic Marg, which will
help overcome the cycle of Birth and Death. This is the
Vastu which cannot be found anywhere in this universe.
Kabir Sahib has said that when Naam, the Guru, and the
Disciple are true then realisation of Satlok (Moksh Dham) is
possible.
_Naam Satya, Guru Satya, Aap Satya Jo Hoy|
Teen Satya Jab Ek Ho, Vish Se Amrut Hoy||_


T h e Forml e s s M i n d **169
Distinction Between A Guru and Satguru**
The readers will find the frequent use of the words Guru
and Satguru in the books published by the Sahib Bandgi
panth. In the ordinary sense, we call a teacher as a Guru
though his teachings have nothing to do with the spiritual
world. It is in the spiritual line alone that we make use of
the word Satguru. Guru is considered as a religious teacher
who possesses the religious knowledge and is in a position
to impart the same to his disciples for their upliftment.We
find the mention of the word ‘Guru’ in our holy scriptures
like the Ramayana, the Gita & the like. However, it is
important to know that the knowledge of a Guru is limited
to that of 3 lokas alone. As such a Guru can in no way be
expected to help us attain true salvation.
It is, rather, a Satguru alone who can help us in this
regard.Now the question arises as to how can we distinguish
a Guru from a Satguru? For this, we have to remember that
there has been no mention of the word ‘Satguru’ and "Sant"
anywhere in any holy scripture before the incarnation of
Kabir Sahib. A Satguru alone possesses the complete
knowledge of the 4th loka. It was only Kabir Sahib who
used this word for a Satguru who possesses the following
seven virtues:

1. He should keep away from lustful life.
2. He should have no attachment.
3. He should depend on his own earnings.
4. He should not be greedy.
5. He should be truthful & unselfish.
6. He should have knowledge of all the holy scriptures.
7. He should have attained union with Param Purush.
Such a Satguru alone has the power to bless the jivas
with the real Naam and help them attain Amarlok—the
abode of Param Purush. Therefore, wherever the readers
may find the mention of the word ‘Guru’ in relation to
Param Purush, they should have no doubt in their mind that
the Guru mentioned is Satguru alone.
