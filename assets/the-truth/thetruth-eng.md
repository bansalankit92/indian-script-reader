My Motive

The world of Holy Saints is unique and altogether
different as compared to this mortal world. Holy saints used
the common man’s language in a very simpler form to convey
their teachings to the common man, about the true presence
and appearance of ‘Supreme Lord’ which can easily be
realized from their sayings. Kabir Sahib and other Holy Saints
used the words ‘Ram’ , ‘Hari’ , ‘Har’ , ‘Sai’ etc in their sayings
to make people understand in people’s language, but the
meaning to all the above said words for them remains the same
which were used for ‘Supreme Lord’ (Sahib) only. So there
is no need to get puzzled while reading out or hearing such
words into their teachings. Kabir Sahib clearly mentioned
about the presence of four different ‘Ramas’ in His own
sayings.
Sakaar Ram Dashrath ka beta,
Nirakaar Ram ghat ghat mein laeta.
Bindu Ram jin jagat pasara,
Niralanbh Ram sabahi te nyara.
It means the ‘Ram’ to whom the world is worshipping
and at the same time considering as ‘Supreme Lord’ is no one
else but a son of king Dashrath. The Holy Saints never talked
about to worship that ‘Ram’. So, then some people do worship
of ‘Formless Ram’ and considers that all Holy Saints were
talked about the same ‘Formless Ram’ as ‘Supreme Lord’.
But, to this ‘Formless Ram’, all Holy Saints addressed him
as ‘Kaalpurush’ who itself is formless ‘Mind’. Now, comes
the third ‘Ram’ who is the source of whole physical creation


The Truth 5

and this is the ‘semen’. So, the fourth ‘Ram’ for which the
Holy Saints talked about is beyond all the three ‘Ramas’ which
is immortal and it never comes in the circle of birth and death
through any form of incarnation. To that very ‘Ram’ all the
Holy Saints addressed him as ‘Sahib’.
Somewhere people find the mentionings of both
Sargun and Nirgun forms of worship and the ‘Words’
associated with the same into the teachings of Holy Saints
which make them think as if the Holy Saints were also doing
the same forms of worship and established the same into their
ideologies, but that is not the truth. Such mentionings of both
Sargun and Nirgun forms of worship are there into the sayings
of Holy Saints (except Kabir Sahib) because before getting
initiation of ‘Alive Holy Name’ by Kabir Sahib, they all were
doing the worship of ‘Kaalpurush’ (Mind / Niranjan / God of
Death). That is why the mentionings of those worships are
there in their spiritual ideologies.
You will also find the mentioning about the secrets of
kriya yog, anhad dhuns (jinglement of words), jyoti, 10th
aperture etc into the sayings of Holy Saints. They mentioned
such things only to convey the powers and limitations
associated with it. They never established such things as the
right medium of worship to realize the true ‘Sahib’. While
conveying all the facts about the above said mediums, Holy
Saints actually established the ‘Naam’ (Alive Holy Name),
alongwith its powers into the world of true spiritualism. Holy
Saints never established those ‘Words’ (Holy Names) as true
‘Naam’ which are present in every human body and can be
recited through tongue. The ‘Naam’ (Alive Holy Name) which
Kabir Sahib and all other Holy Saints talked about is a


6 Sahib Bandgi

formless ‘Word’ that cannot be recited through tongue and in
no way comes under writing, reading or speaking. That true
‘Naam’ is only available to real Holy Saints and is nowhere
to be found in any of the religious scriptures/ manuscripts that
are available to humanity. That true ‘Naam’ is the only key to
unlock the 11th aperture that is present in the concentration
(soul) of every being which actually is the gateway to
‘Amarlok’ (4th Lok) which exists beyond the limits of
universe (3 lok’s) i.e. beyond the reach of mind and body.
My real motive into this world is to create awareness
about the true mode of worship associated with ‘Supreme
Lord’ (Sahib) amongst the masses irrespective of caste, colour,
religion. I really want to share the purest form of knowledge
about soul, mind, body, universe and Supreme Lord with the
whole of mankind where everyone is living in darkness due
to complete ignorance and lack of true spiritual knowledge.

```
Avval sant Kabir hain dooje Ramanand,
tasey bhakti pragat hui saat deep nav khand.
Yak araj guftam paes, tu darr gos kun Kartar.
Hakka Kabir Karim tu, be aib Parvardigar.
—Guru Nanak Dev ji
```

The Truth 7

The Truth

Satya sohi joh vinshae naahin.
The One who was present when there was no creation and
will remain present even when the whole creation perishes. The
One who is Immortal and never comes in the cycle of birth and
death. The One whose existence and presence is far beyond from
the limits of mind and body is the only truth which itself is the
Supreme Lord.

The word ‘TRUTH’ means “The Reality Unknown To
Humanity”. All Truth goes through three phases. First, it is
ridiculed. Second, it is violently opposed. Third, it is accepted
as being self evident.

The same thing happened (as mentioned above) between
the year 1398 - 1518 in India, when ‘Sant Samrat Satguru
Kabir Sahib’ for the very first time defined an unknown truth
to the whole of mankind that, every single human being on
earth is doing the worship of ‘Mind’(Niranjan/Kaalpurush)
not of ‘Supreme Lord’(Parampurush/Sahib) which gave a real
shock to everyone. At that time, Sikander Lodhi was the King
and was ruling over India. The statement and popularity of
Satguru Kabir Sahib became untolerable to Shaekh Taqi who
was the Rajguru (Religious Preacher) of whole kingdom and
he tried his level best to kill Kabir Sahib. He gave 52 death
sentences to Kabir Sahib but failed to kill him. These 52 death
sentences are popularly known as ‘Bawan Kasni’ or as
‘Bawan Zanjeer’. Kabir Sahib was a social reformer who
worked only for the welfare of mankind. He was neither

```

```

8 Sahib Bandgi

against any religion nor an atheist. Kabir Sahib clearly
mentioned in His own sayings that I have descended down
onto earth from such a world which is unknown to all the
religious scriptures/manuscripts that are available to the
mankind. The world where there is no birth-death, no karmas,
no body, no mind, no elements, no universe, no planets, no
cosmos, no day-night, no time, no destruction, no dissolution,
no punishment, no religion, no caste, no colour.
No secondary God (Niranjan, Adhya Shakti, Brahma,
Vishnu, Shiv, Ram, Krishna, Ganesh, Gods-Goddesses, etc.)
exists over there. The world which I am talking about exists
beyond this perishable universe and is immortal. Kabir Sahib
addressed that world with a name ‘Amarlok’ (‘Amar’means
Immortal & ‘Lok’ means World/Abode) in His ideology of
SantMat which indeed is the true origin of all the souls and
is the true abode of Supreme Lord (Sahib). Kabir Sahib says
that I came here as per the desire of Supreme Lord just to
liberate the souls of Supreme Lord from the entrapment of
“Kaalpurush”(Niranjan/Mind) who is cruel by nature and has
entangled all the souls in the endless cycle of birth-death by
creating physical bodies, sex, anger, greed, attachment, ego
and karmas. It is the ‘Kaalpurush’(Mind) himself who is
giving pain, grief, suffering, sorrow to all the living beings
in this mortal world. He also explained that the world in
which we all are residing is the creation of ‘Mind’
(Kaalpurush) and is not at all our true abode. All beings who
are present in this mortal world are completely entrapped in
the endless cycle of birth and death. No being can attain
permanent salvation from the entrapment of Mind and Body
without a true ‘Satguru’ (Perfect Spiritual Master).


The Truth 9

Kabir Sahib clearly explains that every single religion on
earth is the creation of ‘Niranjan’(Mind/Kaalpurush) and all
are doing worship of ‘Niranjan’ (Kaalpurush/Mind) in one
way or the other by considering him as ‘Supreme Lord’
(Sahib), who in reality is the 5th son of ‘Supreme Lord’
emanated from the word ‘Jyoti Niranjan’.
At the same time, Kabir Sahib also explains that Supreme
Lord(ParamPurush – Sahib) is neither have any Form (Sakaar)
nor He is Formless (Nirakaar). Supreme Lord is neither a
Word, Anhad Dhuns (jinglement of words), Jyoti, White
Light, Golden Light nor He is Onkaar, Sohang, Jyoti Niranjan,
Satt, R-Rankaar. Supreme Lord is present within every
individual’s soul and is nowhere to be found in an outer
world. But, realization of Supreme Lord cannot be possible
without the blessings of a true living ‘Satguru’.

Kabir Sahib clearly explains that Supreme Lord (Sahib)
is the only ‘Truth’ and rest all which we are seeing, writing,
reading, speaking, listening, believing and experiencing in our
due course of life is perishable and is the secret play of
‘Mind’(Kaalpurush/God of Death) just to entangle every
single soul (our own true-self) within his own territory i.e.
within the limits of universe (3 lok’s) which holds the endless
cycle of birth and death.

“Satya” samaan dharam nahin aana.
Sahib Ji says that there is no religion equivalent to the
religion of “Truth”.


10 Sahib Bandgi

Ideology of Satguru

Teen Lok se bhin pasara, Amarlok Satguru ka nyara.
The real abode of the Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru)
is Amarlok (4th Lok), which exists beyond universe (3 Lok’s).

The ideology of “SantMat” and “Saints” is beyond the
limits of Sargun and Nirgun modes of worship, which is
totally based on true self-realisation. The complete ideology
revolves around “Satguru” (Perfect Spiritual Master) only and
has no dependence onto any kind of manuscripts / religious
scriptures. The word “Satguru” firstly came into existence
from the spiritual ideology of “Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir
Sahib”.

Kabir Sahib was the only saint in the history of mankind
who placed Guru (i.e. in SantMat word Guru is referred as
Satguru) onto much higher platform as compared to God and
declared that “Guru is greater than God”. Neither any saint
nor any religious scripture ever challenged to declare a Guru
being greater than God. There is a real reason behind such a
bold statement, which Kabir Sahib understands. But, in
today’s modern world, people are fighting to establish their
own individuality and religious rituals due to selfish motive
and lack of true spiritual knowledge.

Sahib Ji says that this universe (3 Lok’s) belongs to
Niranjan (Kaal Purush), who himself resides into every
human body as Mind and rules over the universe. The whole
world is doing worship of Kaal Niranjan (Mind) in one way
or the other by considering him as their Supreme Lord who
created all the entanglements for each individual soul. Mind
10


The Truth 11

is the closest enemy of every human being and is the only
barrier between a Soul and Satguru (Perfect Spiritual Master)
because he knows that only a real Satguru has the power to
liberate each individual soul from the endless cycle of birth
and death. Sahib Ji has always encouraged people to worship
One and only One Supreme Lord (Param Purush/Sahib) who
is immortal and is present into the concentration (soul) of
every human being. But, without getting blessed up with Real
Alive Holy-Name (Sajeevan Naam) of Supreme Lord from
a real Satguru, no one can liberate himself from the trap of
Mind and Body. The existence of Supreme Lord is far beyond
from the reach of any religion, religious scriptures and
religious rituals. Sahib Ji says that only a Satguru knows about
the real identity of Supreme Lord (Param Purush/Sahib) who
is neither have any Form (Sakaar) nor is He Formless
(Nirakaar).

The ideology of SantMat explains the importance of the
Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru) from whom one can
understand the Truth of Life and can easily attain permanent
salvation from the endless cycle of birth and death, only with
His blessings in form of real Alive Holy-Name (Sajeevan
Naam) which does not comes under reading, writing or
speaking. Real Alive Holy-Name (Sajeevan Naam) which
Satguru Kabir Sahib and other Holy Saints talked about is
not at all the subject of speakable words or sentence. It is not
available into any religious scripture or manuscripts. It is only
available to a true living Satguru who has the complete
authorisation to transmit that Alive Holy-Name to any
individual Soul in the universe through His concentration.


12 Sahib Bandgi

“Sahib Bandgi” spiritual organisation has brought a
scientific revolution in the world of spirituality. The
organisation is totally based onto the principles of True
Spiritualism (Satya Bhakti) which completely revolves around
a living Satguru who himself is a truly enlightened soul - His
Holiness : “Sant Satguru Madhu Paramhans Ji” (Sahib Ji).

Sahib Ji himself has the realisation of Amarlok (4th Lok),
which is the real abode of Supreme Lord (Param Purush –
Sahib). Sahib Ji has revealed all the secrets and limitations
of Mind-Body, Creation of Universe, Modes of Worship, Kaal
Niranjan, Realisation of Supreme Lord, True Abode of Souls,
Salvation and many other hidden mysteries which are
unknown to the humanity.

The five major things which Sahib Bandgi spiritual
organisation has revealed as per the true “Satguru Ideology”
are mentioned below :

1. This is the world of Kaal Niranjan (Mind) and he rules
over the universe.
2. Yogis have to struggle really hard to reach up to the
abode of Niranjan (i.e. shunya - the 14th lok, which is present
in every human-being). In veda’s ‘Niranjan’ is being referred
as Nirakaar, Aad Niranjan, Onkaar, Paar-Brahm, Nirgun
Brahm etc.
3. Rishi, Muni, Siddh, Saadhak, Peer, Paegambar, Yogi,
Yogeshvar etc had reached upto the 14th Lok (Shunya) only,
but all failed to attain permanent salvation from the endless
cycle of birth and death i.e. could not escape from the territory
of Niranjan (Kaal Purush - Mind) who himself resides in
shunya (sky-vacuum-space).


The Truth 13

4. Beyond “Shunya” there is the creation of “Maha-
Shunya”. In Maha-Shunya there are 7 Lok’s (worlds/abodes)
where no articles exists. These 7 Lok’s are : 1. Achint lok, 2.
Sohang lok, 3. Mool-Surti lok, 4. Ankur lok, 5. Ichha lok, 6.
Vani lok and 7. Sahaj lok. All 21 Lok’s (i.e. 14 Lok’s up to
Shunya plus 7 Lok’s of Maha-Shunya) up to Sahaj Lok comes
under great dissolution.
5. The soul has descended into this universe from
‘Amarlok’. Amarlok is a world which never comes under any
dissolution and is immortal in nature. In Amarlok, there is
no existence of five elements (water, fire, air, earth, sky),
cosmos (sun, moon, star, planets), gender (male, female),
body, mind, time (day, night, period, phase, era), secondary
god (Niranjan, Adhya Shakti, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiv), birth-
death, punishments, sounds, words, jyoti, jinglement of
words (anhad dhuns) etc.
Bin Satguru pavey nahin, koi kotin karey uppaey.
Without the blessings of a true perfect spiritual master
no individual soul can attain permanent liberation from
the entrapment of ‘Mind’ and cannot reach back to its real
abode ‘Amarlok’.

```
Naam videhi jab miley, andar khulein kapaat.
Daya Sant Satguru bina, ko batlavey baat.
—Tulsi Sahib (Hathras waley)
Tulsi Dass ji says, “The inner gate of conscience gets
opened only after getting blessed with the bodiless
‘Naam’. None but the grace of Sant Satguru can show
the needed path in this regard.”
```

14 Sahib Bandgi

Differences Between

Guru and Satguru

Devi Deval jagat mein, kotin pooje koye.
Satguru ki pooja kiye, sab ki pooja hoye.
The worldly people are engaged in the worship of gods-
goddesses by performing thousands of rituals. Whereas, the
worship of a true Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru) alone
includes the worship of whole divine wisdom.

```
GURU

    state of Oneness with
    Supreme Lord whose

3. Guru is limited only upto
    the limits of Sargun &
    Nirgun modes of worships
    which both comes under
    the territory of Kaal
    Niranjan.

```

```
1. Satguru truly attains the
    state of Oneness with
    Supreme Lord who neither
    have any Form nor He is
    Formless.
2. Satguru has the true

    (4th lok) which exists
    beyond universe (3 lok’s)
    and is the true abode of
    Supreme Lord.
3. Satguru is the one who
    knows about the secret of
    ‘Pra Bhakti’ (Satya Bhakti)
    which is the true worship
    of Supreme Lord and is
    above Sargun/Nirgun
    modes of worships.

          speaking and is present in
          His own concentration.
       5. Satguru solely
          concentrates all His
          devotees to ‘Kripa’

          permanent salvation.
       6. Satguru has the true
          knowledge of 11th
          aperture (Gyarvaan
          Dwaar) which is present in
          concentration and is far
          beyond from the reach of
          Kaal Niranjan (Mind).
       7. Satguru has the power to

          religious scriptures/

The Truth 17

Features of A Real

Satguru

Satya Purush ko jaansi, tiska Satguru naam.
A guru who has the true realisation of Supreme Lord
is a Satguru.

Kabir Sahib in his ideology of SantMat clearly explain
that without understanding the basic difference between a
Guru and Satguru, and by simply considering every guru as
a Satguru is not going to serve the most important purpose
of human life i.e. Maha Nirvana (permanent salvation from
the cycle of birth-death). Such a devotee won’t succeed in
his true purpose and will not be able to reach back ‘Amarlok’
(4th lok). He will instead attain heaven at the most. Kabir
Sahib also explain that a Guru who shows the path of Sargun
and Nirgun modes of worship is without a doubt to be
considered as an ordinary Guru. But, a Guru who shows the
true path of worship related with Supreme Lord
(ParamPurush/SatyaPurush/Sahib) alone, which in reality is
far above from both Sargun and Nirgun worships, is a true
living Satguru. But, in modern times every Guru considers
himself as a Satguru, so in such circumstances it is but natural
for the people to get misled. There are thousands of religious
preachers who talks about ‘Amarlok’ , but have not actually
seen it.

Kabir Sahib knew that in kalyug (modern times) even
unreal Gurus will try to mislead people. So he spoke about
the distinguishing features of a real Satguru. Further, all the
17


18 Sahib Bandgi

true saints have recognised and accepted the same features
when realized the true presence and appearance of Supreme
Lord (Sahib). In fact, the word ‘Satguru’ is not be found in
any of the religious scripture/manuscript before the advent
of SantMat. It is only Kabir Sahib who gave the name
‘Satguru’ to the real holy saints. Earlier there was only the
mentioning and the talk of Guru, Sargun and Nirgun mode
of worships alone which were available to the religious
scriptures/manuscripts. Kabir Sahib for the very first time
revealed the secret of ‘Supreme Lord’ and ‘Amarlok’(4th lok)
to the whole world that lies far away from this universe (
lok’s). In the world of spirituality, all true holy saints
addressed Kabir Sahib with the names ‘Sant Samrat’ ; ‘Sant
Satguru’ and accepted all his true sayings and teachings.

Kabir Sahib shares and further explained all the seven
special features of a real Satguru (Perfect Spiritual Master)
which will help the devotees in seeking up a true living
Satguru. The seven special features are :

1. Nirvasna.
2. Nirbandhan.
3. Saargrahi.
4. Nirlobhi.
5. Satyavaan.
6. Sarvagyi.
7. Ekroop.
NIRVASNA – It means that he should never have sex
with anyone. The lustful activities are always performed in a
state of ignorance. So, how can such a person be called as
the true representative of Supreme Lord. Just as a person


The Truth 19

cannot experience dreams in an awakened state, likewise a
person cannot indulge in sexual activities in the state of
awareness. It is the appearance of sex that makes a man forget
everything else except lustful ideas and deprives him from
the power of rightful thinking. Such a person cannot be
considered as a true enlightened being. Keeping this in view
you must make a search for a Guru who is Bal-Brahmchari
(No sexual relation with anyone right from childhood). Kabir
Sahib says that if a person fails to find a Bal-Brahmchari
Guru, then he should find such a Guru who has become a
sanyasi (who has renounced the world) on becoming
enlightened.

NIRBANDHAN - It means that the Guru should not
have any special attachment with his family members. He
should only have relation with his disciples alone. If he
maintains relation with family, he will then utilize the money
received from the disciples for the welfare of his own family
instead of using that money for the noble deeds. He will
behave in a partial manner and at the time of his departure
from this mortal world will make someone from his family
members or near and dear ones as his successor. The process
of choosing the successor to a Guru should not take place
on the basis of one’s descendant but, should take place on
the basis of the competence of the disciple. The real duty of
a Guru is to liberate the soul of the disciple from the grip of
attachment and to lead him back to its real abode. If a person
wants to liberate himself from the worldly bondage, he should
seek the shelter of such a Guru who himself is free from all
the worldly bondages.


20 Sahib Bandgi

SAARGRAHI - It means that the Guru should live his
life on his own earnings and never beg money from anyone
to feed the body. One should not bow one’s head at the feet
of such a Guru who does not live on his own earnings. Kabir
Sahib says that a Guru who lives on the offerings made by
the disciples will teach the same to his disciples.
NIRLOBHI – It means that Guru should not keep an eye
on the wealth of his disciples. He should instead, utilize the
wealth of his disciples for noble cause. If the Guru does not
possess this virtue, then the future of the disciples will surely
drown in the middle of nowhere.
SATYAVAAN - It means that Guru should be truthful
in all means. Supreme Lord resides only in the heart of
truthful person. Alongwith, the Guru should be one who
serves the society in selfless manner. There is no sin greater
than falsehood and no worship greater than truthfulness.
SARVAGYI – It means that Guru must have hold the
complete in-depth knowledge of all the religious scriptures/
manuscripts as well as know each and every aspect of the
inner spiritual journey and about the whole spiritual world,
so that he may be able to clear all the doubts of his disciples
regarding true spiritualism. If a Guru is not in a position to
clear the doubts of his disciples, then he is not worth being
called as a Guru.
EKROOP - It means that a soul of a Guru should have
become in union with Supreme Lord (Sahib). This seventh
feature can be found only in that Guru who has all the
aforesaid six features. It is such a Guru alone who can be
called as a real ‘Satguru’. He who does not possess all the
seven features should be totally consider as an unreal Guru.
Kabir Sahib says that if you find that your Guru is not a
real one and is not in a position to provide you permanent


The Truth 21

liberation from the endless cycle of birth and death, you
should not waste any time in shunning that Guru. Some
people think that they will commit a sin if they leave their
Guru. But, Kabir Sahib says that such a thinking is not a
rational one in the field of spirituality. You must have no
doubt about it, because every single being has the right to
choose the perfect spiritual master who can easily remove all
the darkness and illusion from the heart of a disciple with
his true spiritual powers in a truthful manner. There is no
harm in seeking the shelter of even 5 to 10 Gurus by the time
one finds a real Satguru.
A person who becomes a devotee of a real ‘Satguru’ will
definitely achieve Maha-Nirvana (permanent salvation) and
that is a true guarantee. There should be no doubt about it.
In order to know the true importance of worshipping a
‘Satguru’, it is very much important to understand the true
difference between Nirgun form of worship and the true
worship of Satguru. But, it must be borne in mind that the
worship of a real Satguru is altogether different from that of
both Sargun and Nirgun form of worships.
Guru milney se jhagda khatam ho gaya.
All search regarding to the realisation of soul (true-
self) and Supreme Lord comes to an end when a true
living Satguru comes in your life and bless you with a true
Alive Holy Name.

The Reality of

‘NAAM’

Koti Naam sansaar mein, tintey mukti na hoey.
Mool Naam yeh gupt hai, jaane virla koey.
There are countless Words (Naam) that are present
in this mortal world into religious scriptures/manuscripts
which can easily be recited with the tongue. But, none of
those Words has the power to liberate an individual’s soul
permanently from the worldly ocean of birth & death.
Whereas, the true ‘Naam’ (Alive Holy Name) which
Satguru Kabir Sahib has talked about is really a secret
which is not at all present in any of the religious
scriptures/manuscripts and is only known to a rare being.
“Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib” is truly the originator
of true ‘Sajeevan Naam’ (Alive Holy Name) which He talked
about in His ideology of ‘SantMat’ (Pra Bhakti) is not the
subject of writing, reading or speaking. It is not available in
any of the religious scripture/manuscript known to mankind.
The ‘Naam’ (Alive Holy-Name) which Satguru Kabir Sahib
and all other true Saints talked about as per the true wisdom
of SantMat, is neither a Speakable Word nor an Inner Musical
Sounds (Anhad Dhuns). It doesn’t mean that Satguru Kabir
Sahib and other true Saints in past denounces the importance
and presence of Words that are related with religions and
religious scriptures. But, the Words that are present into
religious scriptures does not have the power to liberate an
individual’s soul permanently from the territory of Kaal

```

```

The Truth 23

Niranjan (Mind/Mann) i.e. from the endless cycle of birth and
death.
The true ‘Naam’ (Alive Holy Name) which has the power
to liberate an individual Soul from the entrapment of Mind
(Mann) and Body (Maya) according to the true wisdom of
SantMat is “Supreme Lord”(ParamPurush) himself which
does not comes under writing, reading or speaking to whom
mankind wrongly considered as some ‘Speakable Word’ due
to the limitation of their own intelligence and imagination
along with the religious preachers (Gurus) who preaches the
same. Hence, they completely failed to understand the true
secret of ‘Naam’ (also called as Sajeevan Naam
or Saar Shabd) which Kabir Sahib established through His
ideology of SantMat.

Kabir Sahib clearly mentioned in His ideology that “No
individual soul can cross this worldy ocean of mind without
the power of Naam” and at the same time also declares that
“The Right to give Sajeevan Naam to an individual being is
only available to a true living Satguru in this universe”. Due
to complete failure in understanding the secret behind the
above mentioned statements and power of true “Naam” (Alive
Holy Name), thousands of Gurus, Religious Preachers, Yogis
& Self-proclaimed Saints came into existence and started
giving ‘Naam’ (Holy Name) to people in the name of religion
and Supreme Lord by mixing the ideology of Satguru Kabir
Sahib (SantMat) into both Sargun and Nirgun modes of
worships. Likewise, they all become Gurus and established
their own individual organisations of ‘Naam’ (Alive Holy
Name) and declared between people that the “Naam” which
they are giving as in form of “Guru Deeksha” is the only true


24 Sahib Bandgi

“Naam” (Alive Holy Name) which liberates them from the
worldy ocean of birth & death. Hence, all the self-proclaimed
Gurus entangled the whole mankind into Sargun & Nirgun
modes of worship which completely revolves around 5
Speakable Words – Jyoti Niranjan, Onkaar, Sohang, Satt &
R-Rankaar. In reality all these Words (as mentioned above)
are perishable and cannot liberate an individual Soul (our own
true-self) permanently from the territory of Kaal Niranjan
(Mind).

As a result of this, most of the people who adopted the
profession of a ‘Guru’ started giving ‘Naam’ to people with
a motive to Earn Money, Fame & Name. Such kind of self-
proclaimed ‘Gurus’ who have no personal interest in Supreme
Lord, Salvation, True knowledge of a soul, are quite busy in
enjoying luxurious lifestyle. Hence, Sahib Ji warned mankind
to be aware of such self-proclaimed gurus, religious preachers
& saints.

Guru sajeevan Naam bataey,
jaakay bal Hansa ghar jaaey.
A Perfect Spiritual Master when transmits the
Supreme Power into an individual through His
concentration, after then only an individual’s soul will
reach back to its true abode.

```
Kaag palat Hansa kar deena,

The Truth 25

The Mind

Mann He Niranjan, mann he Onkaar, Mann he hai Kartara.
Jeev ke sang Mann kaal rahai, agyani narr jaanat nahin.

Mind himself is Niranjan, Mind himself is Onkaar,
Mind himself is the Ruling Power of the Universe (3
Lok’s).The Death of every being resides with him as in
form of Mind for whole life but, the ignorant human being
is not at all aware of this truth.

The Mind (Mann) is Formless (Nirakaar) and body is
nothing else but a Form (Sakaar) state of Mind. Niranjan (the
5th son of Supreme Lord, emanated from the Word : Jyoti
Niranjan) himself is present as Mind in every human body
who is the Creator of 84 lac living species including human
beings and is the Ruling Power of this universe (3 Lok’s).
His abode is Shunya (vacuum-space-sky) from where he
regulates the whole universe which itself is the 5th element
of the universe emanated from the Word: R-Rankaar. The
colour of Sky (vacuum-space) is black and is formless in
nature. The universe along with this mortal world in which
we all (each individual soul) are living belongs to Mind
(Mann) and Body (Maya) which all comes under great
dissolution. This universe (3 Lok’s) is neither the true abode
of Supreme Lord nor it is the true abode of a Soul (our own
true-self).

The Mind (Niranjan) resides in ‘Sushmana Nerve’ (the
central nerve in between the two nostrils–Ida & Pingla) of
every single human being on earth and has its limitations upto
Saehstrasaar (7th Chakra/Crown Chakra) only from where he
25


26 Sahib Bandgi

regulates the brain of every single human being on earth
except the Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru). Each individual
human being on earth except Satguru is working as per the
command of Mind just to fulfil the never ending desires of
the Mind (Mann) itself which is only associated with a
physical Body (Maya) and has no concern at all with a Soul
(our own true-self). This is only because of Mind that we all
(souls) are living in this mortal world as a physical body,
which in reality is not ours. Every individual Soul except
Satguru who is present in this universe (3 Lok’s) either
residing into a physical body or ethereal body is in the
imprisonment of Mind (Mann).
The Mind (Kaalpurush-Niranjan) is the King of the
Universe (3 Lok’s). The world in which we all are living is
completely an illusionary world which is being created by
Mind itself just to engage each individual Soul into
materialistic things so that none could recognise his true
identity and he can easily mislead each individual being from
its supreme goal of life i.e. Salvation. The Mind only gets
afraid from the Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru) into this
mortal world because in reality ‘Satguru’ himself is the
Supreme Power who can easily liberate each individual Soul
(our own true-self) permanently from the endless cycle of
birth-death with His own Spiritual Powers. The human body
is the only way of means through which we can liberate
ourselves (soul) permanently from the endless cycle of birth-
death by doing worship of the Perfect Spiritual Master
(Satguru).
The Mind itself has four different types of forms which all
are formless in nature and is directly associated with each other.


The Truth 27

1. When the Mind creates a desire, at that very moment
it is being addressed as Mind (Mann).
2. When the Mind starts making decision to fulfil that
desire, in that very form the Mind is being addressed as
Intellect (Buddhee).
3. When the decision gets final by the Intellect, then it is
being passed on to the Memory (Chitt) which acts as a
guiding system on the basis of previously stored information
to produce the best possible way out to fulfil the decision
made by the Intellect.
4. At last, when the Mind commands the physical body
to act, in that very form it is known as Action (Ahankaar –
Kriya).

Every human being in this mortal world spends their
whole life in the same exact manner as mentioned above just
to fulfil the never ending desires of the Mind. The biggest
wonder is that each individual Soul (our own true-self) in this
human body is empowering (giving his own energy) to
regulate the Mind (Mann) and the Body (Maya) against his
own true-self which is the root cause of all the entanglements.
Right from the creation of this universe, the Mind truly
succeeds in making every individual Soul realise that “You
are a physical body”. And surprisingly with the complete
support of each individual Soul (Aatma), both Mind (Mann)
and Body (Maya) also succeeded in hiding the true identity
of the Soul into this illusionary world, because Mind (Mann)
and Body (Maya) very well knows that they cannot operate
this mortal world without the support of each individual Soul
(Aatma) which in reality is our own true-self.

Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib and all other Holy
Saints in past, addressed this Mind with the name “Kaal


28 Sahib Bandgi

Purush” meaning “The Devil” or “God of Death” who himself
is NIRANJAN (NIR means Not Visible & ANJAN means
Eyes; the power which is not visible to eyes or the power
which cannot be seen through eyes i.e. Formless). The
characteristics of the Mind are all Evil i.e : Sex, Anger, Greed,
Attachment, Ego etc. which has been created by Kaal
Niranjan (Mind) himself for each individual living being just
to regulate this mortal world. These evil characteristics of the
Mind are present in every human being and is directly
associated with the physical body. All these evil characteristics
of Mind are completely against to the characteristics as that
of a Soul (our own true-self) because Soul is not at all a
physical or ethereal body which means that a Soul does not
have any physical or ethereal organs in it and its true
existence/presence is beyond 5 perishable elements i.e :
beyond earth, water, fire, air, sky. Soul is never been created
out of blood & semen or by the power of Word and hence it
does not require even a single object out of all the 5 elements
into this perishable universe (3 Lok’s). The Soul (our own
true-self) is Immortal in nature and has all the same properties
in it as that of Supreme Lord (ParamPurush/Sahib) because
Soul (our own true-self) itself is the part of Supreme Lord
whose origin is beyond universe i.e. beyond the limits of mind
and body. Soul (our own true-self) is suffering really bad into
this mortal world with immense pain and sorrow due to the
endless repetition of birth-death which is the creation of Kaal
Niranjan (Kaal Purush), not of Supreme Lord (Sahib).
Each individual human being on earth is doing the
worship of Mind (Niranjan-Kaal Purush) itself in one way
or the other which itself shows the presence of all the Evil
properties of Mind i.e Sex, Anger, Greed, Attachment, Ego


The Truth 29

into every human beings body and are clearly visible even
into the nature of every human being which are not at all the
properties of a Soul. No individual being on earth can control
these evil powers of Mind with his/her own intelligence, yog,
meditation, prayers, religious rituals, worshipping of Idols,
worshipping of Gods-Goddesses or either with the brain
power. All the human beings on earth firmly believes that they
all are doing the worship of ‘Supreme Lord’ which in reality
is not true. The true worship and the realisation of ‘Supreme
Lord’ can never be possible without the Perfect Spiritual
Master (Satguru). Without getting blessed up by the Perfect
Spiritual Master (Satguru) with real Alive Holy-Name of
Supreme Lord which does not comes under writing, reading
or speaking, no one can ever attain permanent liberation from
the endless cycle of birth-death neither can control these evil
powers of Mind: Sex, Anger, Greed, Attachment, Ego while
residing into physical body which is the basic root cause of
all the sufferings like: pain, sorrow, grief, violence, hatred,
lust, jealousy, impatience, cruelness etc. for each individual
being on earth. It is because of Mind only that every
individual being on earth is living in complete darkness by
truly considering himself as a physical body and forgot his
true abode i.e: Amarlok (4th Lok) from where each individual
soul has descended down into this perishable universe (3
Lok’s) which belongs to Kaal Niranjan (Mind). The true
abode of Supreme Lord is “Amarlok” (4th Lok) which is
Immortal and whose existence is beyond the limits of Mind
(Mann) and Body (Maya) i.e: Supreme Lord is nowhere
present in this perishable universe (3 Lok’s). Sahib Ji and all
other Saints addressed Supreme Lord as “ParamPurush –
Sahib” who dwells into the Soul (our own true innerself) and


30 Sahib Bandgi

HIS true existence is beyond the knowledge of all the
religions and religious scriptures that are available to mankind
i.e. beyond the limits of Sargun and Nirgun modes of
worships which comes under the territory of Mind and Body.
The religious scriptures such as Vedas, Quran, Bible, etc.
that are available to mankind are limited only upto the
knowledge of the universe (3 Lok’s) which itself is the
creation of Kaal Niranjan (Mind) and has no description of
“Amarlok” (4th Lok) which itself is the true abode of
“Supreme Lord” that exists beyond the limits of this
perishable universe (3 Lok’s). All the religions with their
respective religious scriptures does not either support or
promote the teachings of violence, falsehood, jealousy, hatred,
criticism, evils etc to the humanity. Every religion on earth
talks only about divine love and praise of the Almighty God.
But, all the religious scriptures failed to realise the true
identity of Supreme Lord as well as the true appearance and
limitations of the Mind (Kaalpurush-Niranjan) and addressed
the presence of Supreme Lord as ‘Formless’ which itself is
the 5th element of the universe i.e : Sky (vacuum-shunya) and
got remain entangled into the territory of this perishable
universe (3 Lok’s) which itself is the abode of Niranjan
(Mind). The knowledge of all the above mentioned scriptures
is the creation of Kaal Niranjan himself which can only
provide four different types of temporary salvations to all the
human beings living in this mortal world.
Only the Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru) knows about
that secret place which is the true abode of Supreme Lord
(ParamPurush/Sahib) and it never comes under dissolution
because no 5 elements exists over there. Supreme Lord
(ParamPurush/Sahib) is neither a Hindu, nor Muslim, nor


The Truth 31

Sikh, nor Christian, nor Buddhist, nor Jainist. Supreme Lord
has neither have any Form nor He is Formless. No physical
body or ethereal body exists over there. His true appearance
is only known to the Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru) which
cannot be described into words because His existence is
beyond the limits of Mind (Mann) and Body (Maya). There
is no secondary God present into “Amarlok” i.e. Niranjan,
Aadhya Shakti, Brahma, Vishnu, Shiv, Ganesh, Ram, Krishna,
Jesus, Buddha, Mahavir etc. does not exists over there. All
the 5 elements: Earth, Water, Fire, Air, Sky along with 5
words: Jyoti Niranjan, Onkaar, Sohang, Satt and R-Rankaar
does not have their reach upto the “Amarlok-Satlok” (4th
Lok). All the 5 words which are mentioned above comes
under the territory of Kaal Niranjan (Mind/Mann) and is the
secret game of Mind himself which plays another important
role to mislead each individual Soul from its true origin i.e.
“Amarlok-Satlok”.

Tera baeri koi nahin, tera baeri mann.
No one is your enemy except Mind who resides with
you all the time.

The Body

Chhit jal pavak gagan sameera,
paanch tattva ko aadham shareera.
The human body which is made up of five elements
i.e. Earth, Water, Fire, Air & Sky is impure in nature.

The human body is made up of 5 elements, which all are
perishable in nature. Vedas has the clear mentioning that the
creation of human body and the universe are exactly the same
and the whole universe is present inside every human body
in equal means. Each element is located at its own central
point and is completely visible in the human body along with
its nature. Each individual element came into existence from
a Word which further has five different forms that help us to
understand the basic presence and nature of all the five
elements into the human body.
The Element - Earth.
Word : Satt
Centre : Anus
Colour : Yellow
Taste : Sweet
Forms : Bones, Flesh, Skin, Pores, Nails
The Element – Water.
Word : Onkaar
Centre : Penis
Colour : White
Taste : Saline
Forms : Blood, Saliva, Perspiration, Urine, Semen
32


The Truth 33

The Element – Fire.
Word : Jyoti Niranjan
Centre : Mouth
Colour : Red
Taste : Spicy
Forms : Hunger, Thirst, Laziness, Sleep, Yawning
The Element – Air.
Word : Sohang
Centre : Naval
Colour : Blue
Taste : Sour
Forms : Speech, Hearing, Force, Contraction, Expansion
The Element – Sky.
Word : R-Rankaar
Centre : Sushmana Nerve
Colour : Black
Taste : Tasteless
Forms : Word, Appearance, Juice, Smell, Touch
Also, the human body consists of 5 Karm Indriyans
(working organs), 5 Gyaan Indriyans (sense organs) & 4
Suksham Indriyans (sensorium). The details are as mentioned
below :
5 Karm Indriyan (working organs) : Feet, Anus, Penis,
Mouth, Hands.

5 Gyaan Indriyan (sense organs) : Eyes, Ears, Nose,
Mouth, Skin.

4 Suksham Indriyan (sensorium) : Mind, Intellect,
Memory, Action.


34 Sahib Bandgi

So, all the 5 elements along with 25 forms and 14
Indriyans (organs/sensorium) as mentioned above makes the
complete physical structure of a human being and is called
as ‘Body’ (Maya -cage into which soul is imprisoned) which
is highly venomous in nature and is completely being
controlled by ‘Mind’ (Mann) who is the Ruling Power and
resides into the “Sushmana” nerve (the central nerve between
the two nostrils Ida & Pingla) from where he gives command
to the brain and regulate each individual soul (concentration)
continuously into the net of infinite desires, intellect, memory,
action which controls each and every activity of a being into
this mortal world. Every human being (except Satguru)
spends whole of his/her life as a servant of this Mind just to
fulfill his infinite desires which are only meant for a physical
body and has no concern with a soul (our own true-self).

Mann maya toh ek hain,
maya mann he samaey.
Both mind and body appear as two different identities
but, in reality they are very much ‘one’ because body is
nothing else but a physical form to mind.

The Truth 35

The Soul

Yeh pinjra nahin tera hansa, yeh pinjra nahin tera.
Sahib is addressing every individual soul with a caution
that, the body in which you are residing does not belongs
to you and in reality is a cage which belongs to mind.
“Concentration is a Soul”. Concentration (Surati-Dhyaan)
itself is the true ideal form of a Soul (our own true-self) which
can be easily experienced into this human physical body as
well as into all other living species that are present in this
mortal world. Soul itself is a part of Supreme Lord
(ParamPurush/Sahib) and is same in all the living species
which consists of two properties. One is “Surati”
(Concentration) which is completely engaged by Mind
(Mann) and the other is “Nirati” (Pranas) which is totally
engaged in breathing i.e Air, and is being deployed through
9 different nerves into a physical body (Maya) which regulates
every single organ of the body with its own power. This is
how each individual Soul (surati + nirati) which in reality is
our own true-self is being entrapped into the net of Karmas
which is being created by Mind (Mann) just to regulate the
Body (Maya) into the endless cycle of birth and death.
Concentration (surati-dhyaan) itself consists of three
major qualities i.e. To Hear, To Understand, and To See.
Concentration is the master-key which is working into every
physical body and without its presence, not even a single deed
(karma) can be accurately performed into this mortal world.
Concentration is the most important factor with which the
whole world is moving. Soul (our own true-self) is neither a
physical body nor an ethereal body and is never being created
out of blood-semen or with any of the five elements i.e. earth,
35


36 Sahib Bandgi

water, fire, air & sky which all are perishable in nature. It
clearly indictaes that the origin of each individual Soul is
beyond the limits of mind, body and the five elements.
Every single religion along with every single religious
scripture admits that something remain exists even after the
death of a physical being that travels to the different worlds
present into the higher limits of the universe just to reap the
fruits (karmon ka phal bhogney ke liye) against all the Good
Deeds and the Bad Deeds which are being performed during
the due course of human life.
The worlds (abodes) that are present in reality into the
higher limits of the universe are : Heaven (Swarg-Jannat),
Hell (Narak-Jahannam), Ancestoral Lok, Dev Lok, Siddh
Lok, Brahm Lok, Vishnu Lok, Shiv Lok, Shakti Lok &
Nirakaar Niranjan Lok (abode of Niranjan - Kaal Purush, who
is being worshipped as Supreme Lord by the people of the
world). All these abodes are neither the true abode of Supreme
Lord nor the true abode of a Soul. The different worlds that
are mentioned above is the creation of Kaal Niranjan (Kaal
Purush) which all comes under the territory of the universe
(3 Lok’s) only and will perish at the time of great dissolution
because all five elements (earth, water, fire, air, sky) with
which the whole creation was being done are itself perishable
in nature. The thing which remain exists even after the death
of a physical body is being addressed as Soul-Aatma-Rooh
in different religions whose meaning remains the same in
every context.
Some of the clear indications and true mentionings about
the endless cycle of birth and death are present in one of the
religious scripture – ‘Bhagavad Gita’ which projects the
reality of the continuous repetition of birth-death for each


The Truth 37

individual Soul into this universe (3 Lok’s). The true sayings
of ‘Bhagavad Gita’ are mentioned below :
“As a person puts on new garments, giving up old ones,
the soul similarly accepts new material bodies, giving up the
old and useless ones”. (Bhagavad-Gita ;Chapter 2 Verse 22)
Soul (our own true-self) is Immortal and is the part of
Supreme Lord (ParamPurush/Sahib) which is never being
created out of blood and semen and has no concern with any
kind of Karmas (Deeds) because a Soul does not have any
physical or ethereal organs in it. Hence, it does not require
any of the article or object that is present in this universe.
The true origin of each individual Soul is Amarlok-Satlok (4th
Lok) which is the real abode of Supreme Lord (ParamPurush/
Sahib) whose existence is beyond the limits of this perishable
universe (3 Lok’s) i.e. beyond the limits of mind and body.
Jeev padda bahu loot mein,
na kachhu laen na daen.
The soul is entrapped in the net of Karmas. Whereas
it has no concern at all with any of the Karma and has
nothing to gain or to lose in this moral world.

```
Bahaut jeev atke rahey, bin Satguru bhav mahin.

Countless jivas remain entangled in the
worldly ocean of birth and death and none is

A True Saint

Paras mein aur Sant mein, tu bado antaro maan.
Voh loha kanchan karey, yeh karlein aap samaan.
There is a big difference between a Paras (a
touchstone) and a Saint (Sant). Paras with its single touch
can only transform an iron into gold but not into paras.
Whereas, a true Saint transforms a human being alike
Himself just through His supreme concentration.

The presence of a true Saint on earth means “An easiest
way to realise Supreme Lord” whose presence is unknown
to the mankind and the only chance for each individual soul
to attain permanent liberation from the endless cycle of birth-
death.
A true Saint cannot be described in words due to the
infinite depth of true spiritual knowledge that flows
soothingly into His spiritual discourses. A true Saint himself
is a true Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru) who has the true
self-realisation of “Supreme Lord” and of “Amarlok” (4th
Lok – Real abode of Supreme Lord) whose existence and
presence is beyond the limits of this perishable universe (3
Lok’s). A true Saint himself has attained permanent liberation
from the entrapment of Mind (Mann) and Body (Maya) i.e.
He attains permanent liberation from the endless cycle of
birth-death. The real abode of a true Saint is “Amarlok” (4th
Lok) which is beyond universe.
A true Saint (Sant) neither gets involved into Sargun
Bhakti nor into Nirgun Bhakti because He is the only single
being into this mortal world who completely rules over Mind
and knows about all the limitations of both Sargun and Nirgun
38


The Truth 39

modes of worship which comes under the territory of Kaal
Niranjan (Mind). A Saint needs no support of any religious
scripture/manuscript to define Pra Bhakti (true worship of
Supreme Lord). The true knowledge of a Soul (Aatam Gyaan)
is only available to a true living Saint because He himself is
an ‘Enlightened Soul’. A true Saint leads a very simple life
as a normal human being which holds no attraction towards
any of the materialistic things present into this mortal world
and does not even perform any miracles infront of the people
by showing off His true spiritual powers. A Saint truly rules
over Mind and has the complete control over all the evil
properties of Mind : Sex, Anger, Greed, Attachment, Ego as
well as on all the forms of senses that are present in the body,
and leads a truthful life just for the welfare of all the suffering
souls who are entrapped in the endless cycle of birth-death
which is the creation of Kaal Niranjan (Mind/God of Death/
God of Universe).
In reality, there is no difference at all between a true Saint
(Sant Satguru) and Supreme Lord (ParamPurush/Sahib)
because a true Saint himself attains the level of Oneness
(completely uniformed with Supreme Lord) which is the state
of Supreme Conscience whose existence is beyond the limits
of mind and body. He is the only Guru available into this
mortal world who has the “Paras Surati” (Supreme
Concentration) with which He can transform any human
being on earth alike Himself and can easily liberate any
individual Soul permanently from the entrapment of Mind
(permanent liberation from the endless cycle of birth and
death) with His own Spiritual Powers. “Paras Surati Sant Ke
Paasa” for which Sahib Ji repeatedly says : The Thing I
Possess Cannot Be Found Anywhere Else In The


40 Sahib Bandgi

Universe. The complete process of awakening an individual’s
Soul through Supreme Concentration is called as ‘Naam
Daan’ which in true means is known as Spiritual Genesism
(on the path of true spiritualism it is called as Bhrangmatta).
A true Saint (Sant Satguru) never talks about to perform any
Religious Rituals, Religious Prayers, Yog Saadhna, Shabd
Kamai, Naam Kamai or Surati Shabd Abhyaas to any
individual being for attaining permanent Salvation.
Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib for the first time
established the role and importance of Sajeevan Naam (Alive
Holy Name) into the field of true spiritualism (SantMat) with
which any individual soul can easily attain permanent
liberation from the endless cycle of birth and death. The
Sajeevan Naam (Alive Holy Name) which Sahib Ji and all
other Saints has talked about is neither the subject of
speakable words nor available into any of the religious
scriptures/manuscripts. The Sajeevan Naam (Alive Holy
Name) which Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib has talked
about into His ideology of SantMat is the ‘Supreme Lord’
himself (ParamPurush/Sahib) which does not come under
reading, writing or speaking and is only available to a Perfect
Spiritual Master (Satguru) in the whole of universe which is
present into the “Paras Surati” of a Perfect Spiritual Master
who in reality is a true Holy Saint.
Sahib Ji clearly gave a word of caution to the whole
mankind just to be aware from such self- proclaimed Saints
or Gurus who have only joined the path of spiritualism just
to earn their bread & butter and to lead a luxurious lifestyle.
Sahib Ji also gave a word of caution to the humanity that not
to follow such kind of self-proclaimed Saints, Gurus or
Religious Preachers who themselves are engaged in the


The Truth 41

endless cycle of birth and death and are doing Sargun or
Nirgun worship (both modes of worships comes under the
territory of Kaal Niranjan - Mind) as well as talking about
SantMat and misleading innocent people from the path of true
worship of Supreme Lord (Param Purush/Sahib) just for the
sake of their own selfish means. In reality, such self-
proclaimed Saints, Gurus and Religious Preachers does not
know anything about the true ideology of SantMat and failed
to understand the true limitations of both Sargun and Nirgun
modes of worships. Hence they declared to the mankind that
Sargun Bhakti, Nirgun Bhakti and SantMat is one and the
same thing. Whereas, the ideology of SantMat has a clear
mentioning in it that ‘Sargun-Nirgun Mann Ka Khela’ means
that both Sargun & Nirgun modes of worship is the play of
Mind.

At present, Gurus who themselves are engaged either in
doing Sargun Bhakti or Nirgun Bhakti (modes of worship)
are also using the title name ‘Saint/Sant’ before their names
because the ideology of Kabir Sahib became so popular
between the people of the world that some of the self-
proclaimed religious preachers in the society started misusing
the true sense of the ideology of SantMat just for their own
selfish means and mislead the whole mankind from the path
of true worship of Supreme Lord (Param Purush/Sahib).
The word ‘Sant’ and ‘Satguru’ firstly came into origin
from “Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib” who gave birth to
the ideology of ‘SantMat’ in which for the first time He
revealed an Unknown Truth to the whole of humanity and
declared that every single human being residing in this mortal
world is doing the worship of “Kaal Purush” (Niranjan) by
considering him as ‘Supreme Lord’ in one way or the other


42 Sahib Bandgi

due to lack of true spiritual knowledge. Kaal Niranjan himself
is present as ‘Mind’ into the physical body of every living
being on earth which itself is the 5th element of the universe
(sky-vacuum). Sahib Ji explained that this mortal world in
which every individual living being is suffering from pain and
sorrow due to the continuous repetition of birth-death belongs
to Kaal Niranjan (Mind) and is not at all the true abode of a
soul. This universe (3 Lok’s) is the creation of “Niranjan”
emanated from the word “Jyoti Niranjan” who himself is the
5th son of Supreme Lord. The true presence and existence
of Supreme Lord is beyond the limits of religions and
religious scriptures which itself is the creation of Kaal
Niranjan (Mind). SantMat undoubtedly has given a complete
new direction to the whole of mankind into the field of
spiritualism. It is the ideology of Saints only which holds the
statement of “Guru is greater than God” i.e. Guru is primary
to God (here, Satguru is being referred as Guru). The ideology
of a true Saint (SantMat) starts from that very point where
both Sargun and Nirgun forms of worship ends.

Sant ki mahima keh na sakey shruti shaesh.
Even vedas & other religious scriptures failed to
praise the knowledge of rare holy saints.

```
Ka-ka kewal naam hai, B-Ba varan sharir.
R-Ra sab mein rum raha, jiska naam Kabir.
Soi Gyani Purush hai, Satguru satya Kabir.
Rajj veeraj paida nahin, swaasan nahin sharir.
```

The Truth 43

Modes of Worship

Bhakti-Bhakti sab jagat bakhana,
bhakti bheid koi virla jaana.
The whole world is worshipping God in their own
ways. But, only the rare being realises about the real
secret behind the true worship of God.
Kabir Sahib has divided worship into three different
modes just to explain its limitations and the achievements
associated with them, to the humanity.

1. Sargun Bhakti – Worship of God in a Form state.
2. Nirgun Bhakti – Worship of God in a Formless state.
3. Pra Bhakti - True Worship of Supreme Lord (Sahib).
Mankind is partially aware of Sargun and Nirgun modes
of worship, which has its limitations upto the universe (3
Lok’s) only and it both comes under the territory of Kaal
Niranjan (Mind). By doing Sargun and Nirgun form of
worships, we (souls) cannot attain permanent liberation from
the endless cycle of birth and death.
Kabir Sahib was the first ever Saint (Sant) in the history
of Spiritualism who revealed the secret of Supreme Lord
(Param Purush) who is Immortal and exists beyond this
perishable universe and as well as explained the right mode
of worship associated with Supreme Lord i.e. Pra Bhakti
(True Worship/Satya Bhakti).
Following are the three modes of worships (Bhakti) as
explained by Kabir Sahib :

SARGUN BHAKTI
Sargun Bhakti is only associated with the materialistic
elements into its physical state present in an outer world such
43


44 Sahib Bandgi

as going to temple-mosque-church for prayers, performing
religious rituals, worshipping Gods-Goddesses, worshipping
of Idols, worshipping of planets, chanting of mantras
etc. Sargun Bhakti only revolves around the Speakable Words
(Varn-natmik shabd) as mentioned in different religious
scriptures. Those who do Sargun Bhakti believes onto the
presence of God in some Physical State (in a Form state ;
Sakaar Roop) and they keep on searching God into an outer
world.

This form of worship has its own limitations, which can
only provide us (to a soul) two types of temporary salvations
i.e. Samipaya and Salokya (for more details read the article -
Types of Salvations Created by Niranjan) for limited time
duration only against our Good Deeds. After death of a
physical being, we (a soul) reap the fruits against our Good-
Deeds (punya karmas) into Ancestoral World (Pitar Lok) or
into Heaven (Swarg lok - Jannat). And onto the completion
of time duration as per Karmas, we (a soul) will again be sent
back to this mortal world (i.e. A Soul again accepts a new
material body) and cannot be liberated permanently from the
endless cycle of birth-death which continues for infinite
period of time. The principles and its fruits associated with
different good-deeds are well mentioned in all the religious
scriptures known to mankind.

NIRGUN BHAKTI
Nirgun Bhakti is directly associated with the Meditation
which has no connection with the objects present in an outer
world (materialism). Nirgun Bhakti only revolves around the
Inner Musical Sounds (Dhun-atmik shabd). Those who do
Nirgun Bhakti believes onto the presence of God in a Non-


The Truth 45

Physical State (Formless/Nirakaar) and they commit that God
itself is present inside every human being.

In Nirgun Bhakti, an individual only concentrates upon
their own inner-self and is mainly focused on the subject of
self-realisation as a soul (i.e. knowing about own true-self).
This requires a lot of self practice. This mode of worship only
revolves around five different ways of meditation postures
defined in Vedas known as : Chachri, Bhuchri, Agochri,
Unmuni and Khechri which only concentrates upon five
speakable words i.e. Jyoti Niranjan, Onkaar (Om-Aum),
Sohang, Satt, and R-Rankaar respectively. All the above five
words are present at their own particular plexus into every
human body. The enterance to experience and to travel into
the universe is ‘Sushmana Nerve’ for all the above mentioned
postures of meditation.

The limitation of Nirgun Bhakti is only up to ‘Dasham
Dwaar’ (10th aperture) and holds the knowledge upto the 7th
Chakra (also known as Crown Chakra/Saehstrasaar present
on the top of the head). With help of complete concentration,
we can see the whole universe inside our physical body and
at the same time travels into the higher limits of universe (3
Lok’s) through different Ethereal Bodies which all are present
inside every human being. Miraculous mind powers gets
generated into one’s body and a person starts getting immense
bliss into their own inner-self. Such an experience cannot be
described in words, which gives an impression and feeling
of true self-realisation as a soul. In the past, Yogis, Rishi-
Munis, Siddh, Saadhak, Peer, Paegambar, Yogeshvars etc
have all experienced these ethereal bodies, which are
available to every human being in equal means. The


46 Sahib Bandgi

descriptions about the reality of these ethereal bodies are also
available in Vedas as well as in the religious scriptures of
different religions.

By doing Nirgun form of worship, we (a soul) can rather
achieve much higher level of salvations i.e. Sarupya and
Sayujaya (has longer time duration) as compared to those who
are doing Sargun form of worship. It has its reach up to the
higher limits of universe such as Dev Lok, Siddh Lok, Brahm
Lok and Paar-Brahm Lok which all comes under the territory
of Kaal Niranjan (Mind- 5th element of the universe). After
death of a physical being, we (a soul) resides into extremely
higher limits of the universe for quite a longer time duration
(upto dissolution of the universe) just to reap the fruits of our
Karmas. And, after the re-creation of the universe we (a soul)
will again be sent back to this mortal world (i.e. A Soul again
accepts a new material body).

We (a soul) cannot attain permanent salvation (Param
Moksh) even by doing Nirgun form of worship.

PRA BHAKTI
Pra Bhakti (also known as True Worship/Satya Bhakti)
firstly came into origin from Kabir Sahib himself. Pra Bhakti
is far beyond from the reach of Sargun Bhakti, Nirgun Bhakti,
Vedas and other religious scriptures. This accurate mode of
worship is the true worship of Supreme Lord who is immortal
and exists beyond the limits of this perishable universe (i.e
beyond Shunya) which is the creation of Niranjan.

Pra Bhakti completely revolves around “Satguru”(Perfect
Spiritual Master) only, who himself is an enlightened soul i.e.
His Soul is in complete union with Supreme Lord (Param


The Truth 47

Purush - Sahib) and attains the level of Oneness which is
beyond the reach of mind. Satguru has all the Spiritual Powers
(Aadhyatmik Shakti), with which He himself liberates each
individual soul permanently from the entrapment of mind
(mann) and body (maya). In Satguru Bhakti, we don’t have
to do anything at all except meditating onto Satguru which
means that we don’t have to perform any religious rituals,
religious prayers, worshipping of gods-goddesses/idols or to
practice hard for any of the Yogic postures as involved in
Nirgun Bhakti, which all are directly associated with the mind
itself but not with the soul and Supreme Lord. In reality,
Realisation of Supreme Lord is not possible without the
blessings of a true living Satguru and we only have to
concentrate ourselves upon Satguru, because Satguru himself
is the Supreme Power which is an unknown secret for the
whole of mankind, where everyone is engaged in doing the
worship of Kaal Niranjan (Mind) as their Supreme Lord due
to the lack of true spiritual knowledge.

The knowledge of Pra-Bhakti was firstly being
introduced to the whole of humanity by Satguru Kabir Sahib
which gave birth to the ideology of ‘SantMat’ in which the
secrets about real abode of a soul “Amarlok- 4th Lok” and
“Supreme Lord” (Param Purush/Sahib) has been revealed.
Our Supreme Lord exists beyond the limits of mind and body.

Pra-Bhakti (SantMat) starts from the point where Nirgun
Bhakti (YogMat) ends i.e. The meditation starts from the 8th
Chakra (plexus), which is at the height of 1 ¼ hands above
from 7th Chakra (i.e. Saehstrasaar) outside body and lasts up
to 9th Chakra (plexus) which is only known to a living
“Satguru”(Perfect Spiritual Master).


48 Sahib Bandgi

The Alive Holy-Name (Sajeevan Naam) which Kabir
Sahib has talked about into His ideology is the ‘Soundless
Sound’ (mukat-atmik shabd) which does not comes under any
writing, reading or speaking. It is the only real Alive Holy-
Name of Supreme Lord (ParamPurush/Sahib) which is
present only in the concentration of a Satguru and has all the
spiritual powers to liberate each individual soul permanently
from the territory of Kaal Niranjan (Mind).

Thus, a soul will reach back to its real abode Amarlok
(4th Lok) after being blessed with Alive Holy-Name by a true
living Satguru which indeed is the permanent salvation
(Param Moksh) from the endless cycle of birth-death.

Bhakti nsaeni mukti ki.
The true worship of ‘Sahib’ is the ladder of
‘MahaNirvana’ which leads to permanent salvation from
the endless cycle of birth - death.

```
Sunn gagan mein Shabd uthat hai,
so sab bol mein aavey.
Ni-Shabdi woh boley nahin,
so Satya Shabd kahavey.
—Paltoo Sahib ji
All the words arising in the shunya (sky-vacuum) forms the
subject of speech, whereas the true word is the only soundless
sound that in no way forms the subject of speech.
```

The Truth 49

Description of Five

Words

Paanch shabd aur paanchon mudra, veh nishchey kar maana
Uske aagey Purush puratan, tiski khabar na jaana.
In past, everyone (Rishi, Muni, Siddh, Saadhak, Yogi,
Yogeshvar etc.) remained concentrated only onto the
following five words: Jyoti Niranjan, Onkaar, Sohang, Satt,
R-Rankaar with their respective meditation postures:
Chachri, Bhuchri, Agochri, Unmuni, Khechri and declared
them as the true methods of meditation through which one
can realise Supreme Lord (ParamPurush) who resides
within each individual’s soul. But in reality, they all failed
to understand the true limitations of the five words which
falls under the territory of Kaal Niranjan (Mind) and
cannot able to realise the true presence of Supreme Lord
(Param Purush / Sahib) whose existence and presence is
ahead of all the five words and five meditation postures.
Before arrival of Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib into
this mortal world, Nirgun Bhakti (mode of worship totally
revolves around 5 words based on meditation, as mentioned
above) was being considered as the only true method of
worshipping and realising Supreme Lord (Param Purush-
Sahib). With this belief, everyone who gets involved into
Nirgun Bhakti considered it as the right path towards
realisation of Supreme Lord because this mode of worship
came into popularity from the times of Rishis, Munis, Siddh,
Saadhak, Yogis, Yogeshvars etc.
Nirgun Bhakti is the mode of worship which is totally
based on meditation (Kriya Yog / Dhyaan Saadhna) and only
49


50 Sahib Bandgi

concentrates onto recitation of one particular word out of all
the 5 words : Jyoti-Niranjan, Onkaar, Sohang, Satt, R-Rankaar
through their own particular meditation postures. It is called
as Surat-Shabd-Abhyaas or Shabd-Kamai or Naam-Kamai or
Kriya Yog and is mainly focused on the subject of self-
realisation (as a soul) which is truly based on self experiences
of inner journey (within the body) through concentration and
travel towards different worlds (abodes) that are present into
the higher limits of the universe. Vedas and other religious
scriptures had clearly mentioned that the whole universe (3
Lok’s) is present inside the human body which holds 100%
truthfulness. But, this knowledge is far beyond from the reach
of those people who are completely engaged into Sargun
Bhakti (doing worship of Idols, chanting of mantras,
following religious rituals) and keep on searching Supreme
Lord into an outer world.
Nirgun Bhakti is only related with the Five Words and
Five meditation postures as mentioned above.The reach and
the limitation of Nirgun Bhakti is only upto the territory of
Kaal Niranjan who himself resides into the 5th element of
the universe i.e Sky (vacuum-space-shunya) from where he
governs the whole universe. The whole humanity is doing the
worship of Kaal Niranjan (Mind/God of Universe/God of
Death) in one way or the other because he never discloses
the true presence of Supreme Lord (ParamPurush/Sahib) to
anyone in this universe, not even to his own three sons
:Brahma, Vishnu & Mahesh. The knowledge of every religion
and the religious scriptures that are available to mankind is
limited only upto the knowledge of universe (3 Lok’s) which
itself is the creation of Kaal Niranjan and everyone considers
him and worships him as formless Supreme Lord due to the
lack of true spiritual knowledge.


The Truth 51

But, all Holy Saints who followed Satguru Kabir Sahib
Ji’s true ideology of SantMat, addressed Niranjan (Formless
God) as ‘Kaal Purush’ (God of Death) who is the ruling power
of this universe and is cruel by nature who continuously gives
pain, suffering & sorrow to each individual being into this
mortal world. No individual being in this universe is safe and
cannot liberate himself permanently from the entrapment of
Mind (Kaal Niranjan) even by doing Nirgun Bhakti because
all the Five words along with Five meditation postures falls
under the territory of Kaal Niranjan (Mind-Mann) whose
limitation is upto the creation of Shunya (14 Lok’s are present
in this creation where articles exist). Above Shunya, there is
the creation of Maha-Shunya (7 Lok’s are present in this
creation where no articles exists) which all comes under great
dissolution. No being can attain permanent salvation (Param
Moksh) from the endless cycle of birth-death and cannot
reach back to its true abode i.e. Amarlok (4th Lok- The abode
of Supreme Lord) even by doing Nirgun Bhakti.
The description of Five Words, their limitations and the
expert masters of each individual meditation posture who in
past, attained perfection over each individual word and has
attained the different types of temporary salvations through
different levels of conscience which are as mentioned below :

1. JYOTI NIRANJAN
Jyoti niranjan chachri mudra, soh hai nainan mahin.
Tisko jana gorakh yogi, maha tej hai tahin.
A yogi called “Gorakh Nath” was an expert of Chachri
mudra (meditation posture) in which he recited the word
“Jyoti Niranjan” and completely fixes his whole concentration
into the nerve called ‘Sushmana’ onto a place midway
between the eyes at the mole inside pupil (also known as
Teesray Till Ki Sadhna). The innermost deeper cells of this


52 Sahib Bandgi

very particular point in the body gets activated only with the
sound of the word: ‘Jyoti Niranjan’ with help of complete
concentration which gives the feeling of immense pleasure
to an individual and produces immense Mind powers which
is being generated by Mind (Kaal Niranjan) itself. It is not at
all the state of true self-realisation (as a soul) and has no
concern with the spiritual powers (powers of a soul).
Gorakh Nath entered into the 4th stage of conscience
(Pragya Awastha / Turiya Awastha) with help of complete
concentration and got an ethereal body called as ‘Mahakaaran
Shareer’ which is of the size equivalent to Split Red Lentil
(Masoor Dal ke daney ke barabar) where he experienced
soothing Golden Light (called as ‘Alakh Brahm’) into which
he looked at the different worlds present in the universe
within the physical body. This path is known as ‘Papeel Marg’
because the whole concentration moves very slowly (as the
speed of an ant) inside one’s body.

2. ONKAAR
Onkaar Bhuchri Mudra, Trikuti hai asthana.
Vyasa Dev tis ko pehchana, chand suraj ho jana.
A yogi called “Vyasa Dev” was an expert of Bhuchri
mudra (meditation posture) in which he recited the word
“OM” and completely fixes his whole concentration into the
nerve called ‘Sushmana’ at Medula plexus (Aagya Chakra).
The innermost deeper cells of this very particular point in the
body gets activated only with the sound of the word: ‘OM’
(Aum) with help of complete concentration which also gives
an immense pleasure to an individual and produces immense
Mind powers which is being generated by Mind (Kaal
Niranjan) itself. It is not at all the state of true self-realisation
(as a soul) and has no concern with the spiritual powers
(powers of a soul).


The Truth 53

Vyasa Dev also entered into the 4th stage of conscience
(Pragya Awastha / Turiya Awastha) with help of complete
concentration and got an ethereal body called as ‘Gyaan
Daehi’ through which he experienced a much higher state and
traveled to much higher level of worlds present in the higher
limits of the universe within the physical body and at the same
time entered into the ‘Onkaar Mandal’ which is the state of
higher conscience than Chachri mudra. This is the stage where
an individual speaks out with a word : ‘Aham Brahmasmi’
which means that ‘I am God’. This famous phrase often
repeated in the Upanishads. This path is also known as
‘Papeel Marg’ because the whole concentration moves very
slowly (at the speed of an ant) inside one’s body.

3. SOHANG
Sohang Shabd agochri mudra, Bhanwar Gufa asthana.
Shukdev tis ko pehchana, sunn anhad ki taana.
A yogeshvar called “Shuk Dev” was an expert of Agochri
mudra (meditation posture) in which he recited the word
“Sohang” and completely fixes his whole concentration into
the nerve called ‘Sushmana’ onto the Jinglements of Words
(Anhad Dhuns) continuously happening inside ‘Bhanwar
Gufa’ which also gives an immense pleasure to an individual
and produces immense Mind powers which is being generated
by Mind (Kaal Niranjan) itself. This mudra is much more
superior than Chachri & Bhuchri mudras (meditation
postures). It is not at all the state of true self-realisation (as a
soul) and has no direct concern with the spiritual powers
(powers of a soul).
Shuk Dev entered into the 5th stage of conscience (Maha
Pragya Awastha / Turiyateet Awastha) through complete
concentration and got an ethereal body called as ‘Vigyaan
Daehi’ through which he experienced a much higher state of


54 Sahib Bandgi

conscience and traveled to the much higher levels of the
universe (has its reach upto the creation of maha-shunya
where no articles exists) at much greater speed as compared
to the Chachri and Bhuchri mudras. In this meditation, a
person listens to the 70 kinds of jinglement of words (Anhad
Dhuns/ Anhad Naad) in Bhanwar Gufa (Bunk Canal) which
in reality originates from Anhad Chakra within the physical
body. Here an individual holds his concentration onto a
particular jinglement of word like: onto a sound of Whistle,
onto a sound of Flute, onto a sound of Tabla, onto a sound
of Mridang, onto a sound of tinkling Bells, onto a sound of
Trumpet etc. and travels to the different worlds present into
the universe. There are 70 different paths that are connected
with 70 individual musical sounds. This path is known as
‘Meen Marg’ because the whole concentration moves onto
different musical sounds in the same manner and at the same
speed as fish moves in water. In Vedas, these musical sounds
(Anhad Dhuns) has also been described as ‘Naad Brahm’ or
‘Bangay Elahi’.

4. SATT
Satt Shabd soh unmuni mudra, soh prakash sanehi.
Tisko zhilmil jyot dikhana, jaana janak videhi.
A yogeshvar and a king called “Janak” was an expert of
Unmuni mudra (meditation posture) in which he recited the
word “Satt” and completely fixes his whole concentration into
the nerve called ‘Sushmana’ at the point called ‘Saehstrasaar’
(crown chakra) which also gives an immense pleasure to an
individual and produces immense Mind powers which is
being generated by Mind (Kaal Niranjan) itself. This mudra
is much more superior than Chachri, Bhuchri & Agochri
mudras (meditation postures). It is not at all the state of true
self-realisation (as a soul) and has no concern with the
spiritual powers (powers of a soul).


The Truth 55

King Janak also entered into the 5th stage of conscience
(Maha Pragya Awastha/ Turiyateet Awastha) through complete
concentration and got an ethereal body called as ‘Vigyaan
Daehi’ through which he experienced a much higher state of
conscience and traveled to the much higher levels of the
universe as compared to Chachri, Bhuchri & Agochri mudras.
In this meditation posture the whole concentration of the body
enters into Saehstrasaar for which Janak got associated with
the title name ‘Videhi’ (Formless Being) after his name. This
is also known as ‘Meen Marg’ where whole concentration
travels into the universe at the same speed as fish travels into
the water.

5. R-RANKAAR
R-Rankaar khechri mudra, duswan dwar thikana.
Brahma-Vishnhu-Mahesh adi le, R-Rankaar ko jaana.
The three Maha-Yogeshvars Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh
were the experts of Khechri mudra (meditation posture) in
which they recited the word “R-Rankaar” and completely
fixes their whole concentration into “Shunya” which is
equivalent to the size of a Poppy Seed (Khuskhus ke danay
ke barabar) while passing through Sushmana nerve. Here they
also enters into the 5th stage of conscience (Maha Pragya
Awastha / Turiyateet Awastha) and attains such a level of
super conscience state which in spiritual terminology is
known as “Dasham Dwar” i.e. opening up of the 10th
Aperture which leads them to the end of the universe (3
Lok’s) where they attains Oneness with Niranjan to whom
they considered as Supreme Lord which is beyond the reach
of yogis.This is also known as Meen Marg which also comes
under the territory of Kaal Niranjan (Mind). This mudra is
much more superior than Chachri, Bhuchri, Agochri &
Unmuni mudras (meditation postures). It is not at all the state


56 Sahib Bandgi

of true self-realisation (as a soul) and has no concern with
the spiritual powers (powers of a soul). This is the end of
Yogmat (Nirgun Bhakti).
Above all, a true Saint (Sant Satguru) also attains this
level of super conscience state and moves further towards the
level of Supreme state of conscience which is the 6th stage
of conscience (Beyond Turiyateet Awastha) while crossing the
territory of Kaal Niranjan (Mind-Mann) which leads to the
opening of “Gyarvaan Dwar” i.e. opening up of the 11th
Aperture which is present into the concentration (surati) itself
that leads to “Amarlok” (4th Lok). It is beyond the reach of
Brahma-Vishnu-Mahesh. This is known as “Bihangam Marg”
because the complete concentration travels into the universe
at the same speed as Bird flies in the sky which is only
available to a true saint. No one has ever attained the Supreme
state of conscience except the true holy saints.

Kaya naam sabhi gunn gavein, videh naam koi virla pavey
Videh naam pavey ga sohi, jiska Satguru saacha hoi.

Everyone praises of those Words that are present in
every human body which can easily be recited with the
tongue, but only the rare beings get blessed up with real
Alive Holy-Name (Sajeevan Naam) which is formless and
it does not comes under writing, reading or speaking. Only
that being will be blessed up with formless Alive Holy-
Name (Sajeevan Naam) who gets the shelter of the true
Perfect Spiritual Master.


The Truth 57

Secrets Behind

Conscience

Mankind is totally unaware of this fact that the play of
continuous Birth and Death is happening, only due to change
in the level of Conscience. “The change into the level of
conscience is Birth & Death”. There are six different levels
(stages) of conscience that is available to every single human
being on earth which is present in every human body. Human
Being is partially aware only from the three different levels
(stages) of conscience i.e. Awakened State, Dream State &
Coma State.

1. Awakened State (Jaagrit awastha) : This is the state
of conscience in which we all are living as human beings and
experiencing every single object into its physical state which
appears to be Real and True in every sense that is available
to all of us into our surroundings. In this state, our
concentration (soul) resides into Eyes. This state of
conscience is a complete cheating state in which brain & heart
does not work together with complete co-ordination. Every
single human being on earth (except Satguru) considers this
state of conscience as the complete truth of life and at last
dies as a physical being only.

```
“Human Beings resides into this state of conscience”.
```
2. Dream State (Swapn awastha) : This is the state of
conscience in which we all experience Dreams while sleeping.
Almost every single human being experiences this state of
conscience into his/her due course of life. The level of
57


58 Sahib Bandgi

knowledge is 16 times lesser into this state of conscience as
compared to Awakened state. Everything that happens into
this state of conscience also appears to be Real until we are
sleeping. In this state, our concentration (soul) enters into an
ethereal body called as ‘Suksham Shareer’ which is present
into a nerve that is located on the left side of the neck below
jawline. This nerve is 1000 times thinner than a hair. The
whole process is automatic for which we don’t have to do
any extra effort. This is a very unique state in which both heart
and brain work together with complete co-ordination. There
is no cheat at all into this state of conscience but it is limited
only upto the duration of sleeping and is not at all Real. This
is the state which may take place at the time of death.

```
“Animals/Insects resides into this state of conscience”.
```
3. Coma State (Susupti awastha) : This is the state of
conscience which takes place while sleeping and is a very
deeper state as compared to a Dream state in which the whole
concentration drops down and gathers into the navel region.
The level of knowledge is 1000 times lesser as compared to
Awakened state. This state is also called as Deep Sleep (a
complete fools state) in which the complete memory of a
person gets disturbed for a limited time frame while residing
into deep sleep. This state of conscience also takes place when
a person gets a severe brain injury. This state takes place
atleast once in a lifetime with almost every human being (age
may vary) while sleeping. This is such a darker state in which
the complete co-ordination of our heart and brain stops and
cannot respond to any physical activity at all. This is the state
which takes place in every human beings life at the time of
death except those who has the shelter of a true living Satguru.


The Truth 59

“Trees/Plants resides into this state of conscience”.
But, there are 3 more higher states of conscience which
is above the level of our present state of conscience i.e.
Awakened state in which we all are living by considering
ourselves as physical body. These higher levels of conscience
are available to every single human being in equal manner
and are known as : Turiya State, Turiyateet State & Supreme
State (Beyond Turiyateet State).

Mind, who is the Ruling Power of the universe has only
one single duty to perform into His whole creation of the
universe i.e : He never allows any individual human being
to realise his own true-self (soul) in the due course of life
and at the same time he never wants that one should even
think onto the subject of Self-Realisation and Salvation, so
that none could attain the permanent liberation from the
endless cycle of birth-death. This is the only reason why Mind
never sleeps even when all the living beings on earth comes
at rest and goes to sleep. He never allows any being into this
mortal world to do the worship of a true Perfect Spiritual
Master because only a true Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru)
knows about the true appearance, existence and all the
limitations of Mind. He is the only Perfect Master of Mind
in this mortal world as well as in the whole of universe who
completely rules over Mind and knows about all the secrets
behind the creation of this universe as well as the real abode
of Supreme Lord (all Saints addressed that Supreme Power
as ParamPurush/Sahib) whose existence is beyond the limits
of mind i.e. beyond universe. Everything which we all are
seeing and experiencing around us through our eyes appears
to be Real and at the same time gives an impression that it is


60 Sahib Bandgi

the only truth of human life which is only due to the state of
conscience in which each individual soul considers its own
true-self as a physical body. But, in reality ‘Truth’ exists far
beyond from the limits of mind & body.

In past, our ancestors who practically experienced these
next levels of human conscience and also experiences the
whole of universe through concentration within their own
physical bodies are the Rishis, Munis, Siddh, Sadhaks, Yogis,
Yogeshvars, Peer, Paegambar etc who then gave this
knowledge to the humanity which is present in all the
religious scriptures/manuscripts available to mankind. But,
they all failed in attaining up the Supreme State of Conscience
which in reality is the true state of Self-Realisation as a Soul
whose existence is beyond Turiyateet State and got remain
entangled into the territory of Mind which itself is the 5th
element of the universe i.e. sky (shunya-vacuum). Only a true
Perfect Spiritual Master (Satguru) attains the level of Supreme
State of Conscience because only He knows the secret of that
path which helps an individual soul to liberate from the
territory of Mind and leads back to their origin – ‘Amarlok’
which itself is the true abode of Supreme Lord. Now, let’s
see to the next three levels of our conscience which Sant
Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib describes into His ideology are:

4. Turiya State (Turiya awastha) : This is the state of
conscience which is the next level as in comparison to our
present level of conscience in which we all are living as
human beings into this mortal world. To attain this 4th state
of conscience we need a complete accurate guidance and
direction of a Perfect Spiritual Master. In this level of
conscience, the complete concentration (surati) along with
Pranas (nirati) i.e. Breathing enters into the ‘Sushmana’ nerve.


The Truth 61

The physical movement of the body gets completely locked
up and the whole body appears to be vacant. Here, a person
nearly experiences death while remaining into this physical
body where the individuality of a person nearly becomes
breathing only because the ‘Nirati’ (Pranas) gets completely
concentrated in Sushmana nerve along with ‘Surati’
(Concentration). Here, in this state of conscience a Soul gets
liberated out from three elements only i.e. Earth, Water & Fire
and got completely engaged into breathing i.e. Air. Such an
individual partially travels into the different worlds that are
present into the higher limits of the universe with help of an
ethereal body within their own innerself. The limitation of
this level of conscience is only upto the Medula Plexus
(Aagya Chakra). Yogis attains this level of conscience with
help of complete concentration which indeed is the higher
level of temporary salvation as compared to Heaven &
Ancestoral abode. Mind becomes visible into this state of
conscience which is present into Sushmana nerve and after
that such a person never gets attracted back towards the
materialistic things which then appears to him as
entanglements of Mind created just to mislead every being
from the real motive of human life i.e. Salvation. But, this
state of conscience is not at all the state of Supreme
conscience and neither a state of true self-realisation as a Soul.
“Gods-Goddesses (Idols, Devi-Devtaas, Siddhs, Yogis
etc.) resides into this state of conscience”.

5. Turiyateet State (Turiyateet awastha) : This is the
state of conscience which is one step ahead from the Turiya
state and is called as Super Conscience. Also, to attain this
5 th state of conscience we need a complete accurate guidance
and direction of a Perfect Spiritual Master. In this next level


62 Sahib Bandgi

of meditation, the Nirati (Pranas) gets completely
concentrated in Sushmana nerve with help of complete
concentration and enters into Bhanwar Gufa which is also
know as Bunk Canal. Some of the yogeshvars holds their
complete Surati (Concentration) onto jinglement of words
(Anhad Dhuns) which is of 70 kinds that are continuously
happening inside Bhanwar Gufa and travels into the much
higher levels of universe with help of an ethereal body which
is far superior than the Turiya state. Here, the soul still
remains engaged into the element Air. Some yogeshvars
moves further and hold their complete concentration into
Saehstrasaar where an individual completely experience
himself as a formless being. The physical movement of the
body gets completely locked up and the whole body appears
to be vacant. Here, in this level of conscience the soul gets
liberated out from 4 elements of the universe i.e. Earth, Water,
Fire & Air and remain entangled into the 5th element i.e. Sky.
And above all, some of the maha-yogeshvars moves further
and hold their complete concentration into ‘Shunya’ while
passing through Sushmana nerve and opens up the 10th
aperture which is also known as ‘Dasham Dwaar’ and
wanders into the ultimate level of Super conscience state.
Here, in this level of conscience the soul still remain
entangled into the 5th element of the universe i.e. Sky which
itself is the abode of Kaal Niranjan (Mind). The reach of these
different levels of conscience within Turiyateet State is upto
the creations of shunya and maha-shunya abodes. But, this
state of conscience is not at all the state of Supreme
conscience and neither a state of true self-realisation as a Soul.
All the 5 states (Awakened State, Dream State, Coma State,
Turiya State & Turiyateet State) of conscience falls under the


The Truth 63

territory of mind and body which itself is the territory of Kaal
Niranjan (Mind).
“Niranjan, Aadhya Shakti, Brahmaji, Vishnuji, Shivji,
Maha-Yogeshvars resides into this state of Super
conscience”.

6. Supreme State (Beyond Turiyateet State) : A
Supreme state of conscience is ahead of Turiyateet state. The
secret path of this 6th state of conscience is only known to a
true Saint (Sant) who himself is a true Perfect Spiritual Master
(Satguru). In this level of meditation, the Nirati (Pranas) gets
completely merged into Surati (concentration) and enters into
the 8th Chakra (plexus) which is at the height of 1¼ hands
above Saehstrasaar (7th Chakra/Crown Chakra). This is called
as “Surati Kamal” which is the abode of a “Satguru” and is
the opening of the 11th aperture (Gyarvaan Dwaar) which
leads to ‘Amarlok-Satlok’. It is in the concentration which is
the abode of “Hansa” (Soul) where Supreme Lord (Param
Purush/Sahib) Himself resides. Here, in this Supreme level
of conscience, the Soul gets completely liberated out from
all the 5 elements of the universe i.e. Earth, Water, Fire, Air
& Sky i.e. the Soul gets completely liberated out from the
territory of Mind (Mann) & Body (Maya) and attains the level
of Immortality as well as attains the level of Oneness with
Supreme Lord (ParamPurush – Sahib) which indeed is the
permanent salvation and is the state of true self-realisation
as a Soul. This Supreme state of conscience is beyond the
limits of mind (mann) & body (maya).
“A Saint (Sant) who himself is a Perfect Spiritual
Master (Satguru) resides in this Supreme state of
conscience”.


64 Sahib Bandgi

Salvations Created by

Kaal Niranjan

Mukti mukti sab jagat bakhana
Mukti bheid koi virla jaana.
Everyone in this mortal world really understand the
importance of salvation and shows their concern in
attaining up the same. But, the secret to attaining up the
permanent salvation is only known to a rare being.

In the religious scripture “Vedas” (the world’s oldest
knowledge of universe) there are only four kinds of temporary
salvations mentioned which are available to mankind i.e. there
is neither any mention about permanent salvation (Param
Moksh) nor any facts of Amarlok (4th Lok- real abode of a
soul) whose existence is beyond universe, in any of the
religious scriptures. All knowledge in this world is emanated
from Vedas, which is limited in its approach upto Shunya
(sky-space-vacuum) and described ‘Niranjan’ as Formless
Supreme Lord (Nirakaar Paramatma).

Satguru Kabir Sahib was the first Holy Saint into the
history of mankind who clearly explained and says that
“Mind” itself is Niranjan who is Formless in nature and
resides into the 5th element of the universe i.e. sky-vacuum-
shunya which is perishable and at the same time resides into
every human being as in form of Mind.

By worshipping God in a Form mode (Sakaar-Physical)
or in a Formless mode (Nirakaar-Non Physical), a human
being can only attain the following four kinds of temporary
salvations which all were created by Kaal Niranjan (Mind).
64


The Truth 65

1. SAMIPAYA
An Individual who do noble deeds (punya-karmas), never
give harm to any of the living species and worship the
Ancestors attains SAMIPYA salvation. After death of a
physical body, a soul of that individual being finds a place
into Ancestoral World (Pitar-Lok) and enjoys all the partial
comforts over there as per Karmas for quite sometime. But,
onto the completion of time period, an individual soul again
comes back to this mortal world i.e. re-birth takes place of a
new physical being concerned with the same individual soul.
2. SALOKYA
An Individual who do noble deeds (punya-karmas) as
mentioned in Vedas and other religious scriptures, never take
meat-wine, do acts of charity and worship one or the other
deity for whole life attains SALOKYA salvation. After death
of a physical body, a soul of that individual being finds a place
into Heaven (Swarg-Jannat) and enjoys all the partial
comforts over there for thousands of years against noble
deeds. But, onto the completion of time duration against noble
deeds, an individual soul again comes back to this mortal
world after reaping the fruits of noble deeds i.e. re-birth takes
place of a new physical being concerned with the same
individual soul.
3. SARUPYA
An Individual who rise above Sargun worship and
wanders in the limits of “Brahm” attains SARUPYA
salvation. After death of a physical body, a soul of such an
individual being finds a place in “Brahm-Lok” for lacs of
years and enjoys all the comforts over there which are of
much higher level as compared to the comforts of Heaven.
But, onto the completion of time duration, an individual soul


66 Sahib Bandgi

again comes back to this mortal world i.e re-birth takes place
as a new physical being concerned with the same individual soul.

4. SAYUJAYA
An Individual who worship only the Formless God
(Nirakaar Niranjan), gets absorbed in Formless after death of
a physical being which is known as SAYUJAYA salvation.
Such an individual soul wanders in the limits of “Paar-
Brahm” and enjoys the bliss into that extremely higher level
of universe which can’t be described in words. But, onto the
re-creation of the universe, that individual soul will again
comes back to this mortal world and re-birth takes place as a
new physical being.

It clearly indicates that Kaal Niranjan (Mind), who is the
ruling power of the universe, has created all the temporary
salvations in this universe just to entangle each individual soul
into the endless cycle of birth and death which itself is the
biggest pain for all of us. He has all the powers to mislead
each individual soul from the right path towards permanent
salvation (Param Moksh).
But, in the whole of universe, only “Satguru” (The
Perfect Spiritual Master) has the spiritual powers with which
He can easily liberate the Souls permanently from the territory
of Niranjan (Mind) i.e. from the endless cycle of birth and
death.

Mukti bheid main kahun vichaari.
I have shared such a true hidden secret of moksh
(maha nirvana) which is unknown to the whole of
mankind. A true being must think upon it seriously by
giving a deep thought onto my words.


The Truth 67

Origin of Soul

Amarlok hanson ka dera,
Parampurush jahan karein basera.
The real abode of a soul is ‘Amarlok’ where Supreme
Lord Himself resides.

The origin of a soul is “Amarlok” which indeed is the
true abode of Supreme Lord (ParamPurush/Sahib). Every
single element and article which is present in the whole
universal creation comes out of Him only.

Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib for the first time
revealed all the secrets about this unknown path to
Immortality in His ideology, which indeed is the true origin
of a Soul. ‘Amar’ means immortal and ‘Lok’ means abode.
The abode of a Soul (our own true-self) is immortal and its
existence is beyond the creation of universe i.e. beyond all
the 5 perishable elements - Earth, Water, Fire, Air & Sky as
well as beyond the knowledge of Vedas, Bhagavad Gita,
Ramayana, Quran, Bible and all other religious scriptures/
manuscripts that are available to mankind.

No secondary God exists in ‘Amarlok’ i.e. Kaal Niranjan
(every single being worships him by considering him as
Supreme Lord and addresses him with the names - God,
Heavenly Father, Bhagwaan, Ishwar, Rabb, Nirakaar
Paramatma), Aadhya Shakti, Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesh,
Ganesh, Ram, Krishna, Jesus, Buddha, Mahavir, Gods-
Goddesses, Peer, Paegambar, Yogeshvars etc. have no
existence in ‘Amarlok’.

```
67
```

68 Sahib Bandgi

None of the 5 Words – Jyoti Niranjan, Onkaar, Sohang,
Satt, R-Rankaar from which 5 individual elements Fire,
Water, Air, Earth & Sky came into existence does not exists
in ‘Amarlok’. The world where there is no dissolution,
destruction, karmas, body, mind, punishment, fear, grief, pain,
sorrow, birth, death, caste, colour, creed, religion, rituals,
physical body, ethereal body, time, mass, length. No Anhad
Dhuns (Anhad Naad / Naad Brahm), Jyoti, Prakash, Sun,
Moon, Planets, Stars etc exists in ‘Amarlok’. It is beyond the
limits of mind (mann) and body (maya).

Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib clearly mentioned in
His ideology of SantMat and at the same time addresses the
whole of humanity with a word of caution that “No individual
soul (our own true-self) can attain permanent liberation from
the endless cycle of birth-death i.e. can never liberate from
the entrapment of Mind (Kaal Niranjan) without getting
blessed with Alive Holy-Name (Sajeevan Naam) by a true
living Satguru (Perfect Spiritual Master).

Jeh vahan se hansa aaya,
amar hai woh lokwa.
The abode from where each individual soul has
descended down into this perishable universe is an
immortal world and is called as ‘Amarlok’.


The Truth 69

Surati Yog

Surati ka hai khel sara,
surati mein rachyo sansara.
The whole play is of concentration and the whole
creation itself is being done in concentration.

Sant Samrat Satguru Kabir Sahib for the first time explore
the secret of “Surati Yog” in His ideology of ‘SantMat’ and
also explained the true limitations of ‘Sthool Yog’ &
‘Suksham Yog’ into the field of spirituality.

As far as ‘Sthool Yog’ (physical yoga) is concerned, it is
completely associated with different physical Asanas (postures
of body) of Yoga through which we can easily maintain our
physical health to lead a healthy life. It is only meant for the
maintainence of physical body and has no concern at all either
with self-realisation (as a Soul) or with the true realisation
of Supreme Lord (Sahib).

The second kind of Yoga which is called as ‘Suksham
Yog’ is based on meditation in which an individual completely
holds his concentration onto one of the 7 different plexuses
(Chakras) that are present in every human body and
experiences different worlds which are present into higher
limits of the universe. An individual also experiences White
Light, Golden Light, Jyoti, Jinglement of Words (Anhad
Dhuns) etc. within the physical body. The master-key to
unlock all the 7 Chakras (plexuses) is Concentration (surati).
And, while holding complete concentration onto any one
particular plexus, the innermost deeper cells of the body along
with the innermost deeper nerves that are present on that
69


70 Sahib Bandgi

plexus (chakra) gets activated and generates immense powers
within the body which is directly being generated by Mind
itself. The Mind Powers (Riddhis-Siddhis) that an individual
experiences and attains through this ‘Suksham Yog’ are not
at all the true spiritual powers of a Soul and has no concern
with Self-Realisation (as a Soul) or with the true Realisation
of Supreme Lord. This ‘SukshamYog’ has its limitations upto
the ‘Dasham Dwar’ (opening up of 10th aperture) only which
remains under the territory of Mind.

So, both ‘Sthool Yog’ & ‘Suksham Yog’ are directly
associated with Mind which remains under the territory of
Mind (in the universe) itself. Hence, an individual cannot
attain permanent liberation from the territory of this universe
which belongs to Mind.

Whereas, ‘Surati Yog’ which Kabir Sahib has talked
about in His ideology of SantMat means “Always remain
concentrated onto Satguru” because a true living Satguru is
the only real source of true spiritual powers (aadhyatmik
shakti) which itself are the powers of Supreme Lord (Sahib)
and at the same time is the only Perfect Spiritual Master in
the universe who completely rules over Mind. Sahib Ji clearly
mentioned that keeping concentration on Satguru is the easiest
and the direct way to attain the true spiritual powers of a soul
(concentration) which are already present in our soul
(concentration) itself and then we will be able to see every
single activity of Mind i.e Mind, Intellect, Memory & Action
within the physical body and can easily rule over Mind who
continuously engages the concentration (our own true-self)
in materialistic things which are present in an outer world so
that he can rule over every single human being on earth.


The Truth 71

Without the blessings of a true Satguru, an individual being
cannot see the net of evil properties which all are formless
in nature and resides in Mind i.e. Sex, Anger, Greed,
Attachment, Ego etc. and can never understand the depth and
importance of ‘Surati Yog’ because Mind does not involves
in it. This is the path of true self-realisation which leads to
permanent salvation from the endless cycle of birth & death.

Jaaki surati laag reh jeheinva,
kahey kabir pauhchaun tehvaan.
Wherever an individual engages his concentration
(surati), his pranas (nirati) will definitely lead over to that
place and completely gets merged into it, at the time of
death.

```
Koi sargun mein reejh raha, koi nirgun thaehraye.
Dadu atpat chaal Kabir ki, mujse kahi na jaye.
Hindu to hadd mein chaley, Musalman hadd paar.
Dadu chaal Kabir ki, mujse kahi na jaye.
Dadu Dayal ji says that people are engaged in Sargun
(with form) or Nirgun (formless) forms of worship &
seems to be satisfied with such worships. But, Kabir
Sahib’s philosophy is altogether different from these &
is indescribable. The Hindus remain within the limits
of shunya whereas the Muslims has there reach above
shunya. But, Kabir Sahib shows the rare path to be
followed which is beyond the reach of both shunya and
maha-shunya creations.

True Sayings of Sahib Ji

Ek Kabir bhav mein dubaey,
ek Kabir bhav paar lagaey.
Sahib Ji says that hypocrites played a very big role in
defaming the real personality of ‘Kabir Sahib’ and presented
the unreal knowledge about His sayings in front of people.
So, people who are following the unreal and defame
personality of Kabir Sahib will for sure drown into the
worldly ocean of birth and death. And, the true personality
of ‘Kabir Sahib’ which has never been presented in front of
humanity that too in a truthful manner, holds the true authority
and supreme power to liberate the souls permanently from
the worldly ocean of birth and death.

Saeeyaad ke kaboo mein hain sab jeev baecharey.

Sahib Ji says all the souls which are present in this
universe are under the complete influence and control of
‘Kaalpurush’ (Mind/God of Death) who is the creator of this
universe (3 lok’s).

Paanch naam hain brahm swaroopa,
uske aagey ‘Naam’ anoopa.
Sahib Ji says that all the five words : Jyoti Niranjan,
Onkaar, Sohang, Satt, R-Rankaar with which the whole
universe (3 lok’s) has been created holds the power and
appearence of Brahm(creator). But, above all the five words,
there is one true and unique ‘Holy Name’ which is Immortal
and holds the Supreme Power to liberate all the souls from the
entanglement of mind and body. The true knowledge about that

```

The Truth 73

‘supreme holy name’ is unavailable to all the religions
alongwith their respective religious scriptures/manuscripts.

Paap punya yeh dono baedi,
ik loha ik kanchan keri.
Sahib Ji says that both inauspicious karma (paap) and
auspicious karma (punya) is a chain of bondage for every
soul, one is of iron and the other is of gold which is the
creation of Kaal Niranjan (Mind) who entangled every soul
into the net of karmas.

Guru bin hirdaey shuddh na hoi,
kotin bhaanti karey jo koi.
Sahib Ji says that without the blessings of a true Guru,
the heart of a being cannot be purified, even if a being tries
onto billion over other methods/ways to completely purify his/
her own heart.
Guru hain badey Gobind se, mann mein dekh vichaar.
Hari sumrey soh vaar hai, Guru sumrey soh paar.
Sahib Ji says that as per the ideology of SantMat, “Guru
is greater than Supreme Lord”. Just think over it. Meditating
directly onto Supreme Lord will not provide any help or
protection to a being, whereas meditating onto a true Guru
will provide all the help and protection to a being while living
in this mortal world and will also provide permanent salvation
from the endless cycle of birth and death.

Guru milney se jhagda khatam ho gaya.
Sahib Ji says that all search regarding to the realization
of Soul (true-self) and Supreme Lord comes to an end, when
a true living Satguru comes in your life and bless you with a
true Alive Holy Name (Sajeevan Naam).


74 Sahib Bandgi

Tann ki jaaney mann ki jaaney ghatt ki jaaney chori,

Uss ‘Sahib’ se kya chhipa hai jiskey haath mein dori.

Sahib Ji says that ‘Sahib’ who is the Supreme Lord of
souls knows each and every movement of body, mind and
heart. He holds the life force of every living being. So, you
have nothing of your own which you can hide from the eyes
of ‘Sahib’.

Koti naam sansaar mein, tintey mukti na hoey.
Mool Naam joh gupt hai, jaaney virla koey.
Sahib Ji says that there are crore over ‘Holy Names’
(Words) present in this mortal world, which all are unable to
provide us permanent salvation. Whereas, the true ‘Alive
Holy Name’ which holds the supreme power to provide us
permanent salvation is an absolute secret which is only known
to a rare being in this mortal world.

Mann ki tarang maar do, toh ho gaya bhajan.
Aadat buri sudhaar lo, toh ho gaya bhajan.
Aaye ho tum kahan se, aur jana hai kahan.

Sahib Ji says that by just killing the commands (comes
in form of vibrations to the brain) of mind and by leaving all
the bad habits, your worshippness to Supreme Lord is over.
‘Where have you come from and Where you have to go’; by
just giving a sincere thought to it, your worshippness to

of ‘Kaal Niranjan’ (Mind) has no permanent exit for a soul
from the circle of birth and death. Every single soul will keep
on revolving in the continuous cycle of birth and death within
the creation of ‘Kaal Niranjan’.

Whereas, the true abode of a Satguru is the 4th loka
which exists beyond Kaal Niranjan’s territory and is the only
permanent exit available for a soul which leads back to
origin.

Kabir mann toh ek hai, bhavey jahan lagaey,
Bhavey guru ki bhakti kar, bhavey vishaey kamaey.
Sahib Ji says that Mind is only one and can be involve
into any kind of activity in life. It’s upto you, that either you
involve mind in the worship of a true Guru or you involve
mind in lustful activities.

‘Amarlok’ hai sabse nyara,
mann maya na pavey para.
Sahib Ji says that ‘Amarlok’ which is the true origin of
all the souls is unique as in comparison to other abodes which
are present in this universe. Mind and Body cannot go beyond
the limits of universe, and does not have their reach upto
‘Amarlok’ which exists beyond universe.

Sabki gathri laal hai,

Sahib Ji says that every single human being on earth is
filled up with equal miraculous powers and has no
differentiation of any type at all between a poor and a rich.
No individual being is empty from inside and has the presence
of same Soul which truly belongs to ‘Sahib’ (Supreme Lord).

But, it is only the ‘Kabir Sahib’ who succeeded in maintaining

in this world.
Naam satya Guru satya, aap satya joh hoey.
Teen satya jab ek hon, toh vish se amrit hoey.
Sahib Ji says that in ‘Satguru Bhakti’, three things are
equally important to transform the poison into nectar. Firstly,
“Naam” should be of True nature. Secondly, “Guru” should
be of True nature and must have attained Oneness with
Supreme God (Sahib). Thirdly, a disciple should also be of
True nature towards his Guru after taking “Naam” and will
never try to find another shelter for himself during problems/
hardships in life. Sahib Ji says if all the three things are
truthful in nature, only then, the poison will turn into nectar
i.e : such a being will attain permanent liberation from the
endless cycle of birth and death within no time.

territory.

The Truth 83

The Reality of Ghosts

(Evil Spirits)

It is said that the soul of Abraham Lincoln continued to
wander in the President House even after his death. Once a
journalist asked Mr. Regan (Former President of America)
that did u ever felt the presence of the wandering soul of Mr.
Lincoln in White House? Mr. Regan laughed and said that it
was better to leave that question. On being requested again
and again, Mr. Regan said that he had actually seen the soul
of Mr.Lincoln at various occasions. He had seen him working
in White House. He also said that his pet dog also barked on
it on all such occasions. But, he told the journalist that if he
wrote such a thing in his newspaper, then the people would
comment that the president of such a powerful country like
America is lying and speak all rubbish things in today’s
modern scientific world.

It is true that evil spirits have their own existence. They
are infact, one out of the eighty four lac species (yunis). The
religious scriptures has describe this category as a very dirty
one. Those who deserve hard punishment, attain this category
of a ghost. All other forms of living beings like insects, birds
etc. are somewhat better because they possess a physical body.
But, ghosts does not have any physical body. They are forced
to satisfy all their needs inside the bodies of other living
beings. Six types of evil doers attain this fearful and hateful
specie. After attaining it, they wander like dogs and often
return to the place where their family members or other
descendants live.

```
83
```

84 Sahib Bandgi

Let’s now understand as that how do they enter the bodies
of others. Suppose some evil spirit has to enter the body of
some person named Tom. It will make Tom forget his own
identity and will then use his body according to its own
manner. It is similar to the case of air that comes out of a
bottle when water is poured into it. Just as drunkard forgets
himself and becomes senseless after taking too much of
alcohol, a man also does the same when some evil spirit enters
into his body. Accordingly, the original behaviour and nature
of Tom will give place to the new one of the evil spirit.
But, the evil spirits cannot enter the bodies of all. They
enter the bodies of only those who are weak from brain and
less awakened. They cannot enter into the bodies of such
people who are brave and more awakened. We should not
forget that the evil doers always take forcible action only
against poor and helpless people. But these evil spirits do not
enter the bodies of others as and when they desire. These do
so only when one is asleep. Moreover, they prefer to enter
the bodies of females as they are less mentally strong as
compared to men.
During sleep, evil spirit come and put pressure on the
concerned person. A person will feel as if some heavy weight
has been put on him. The voice of such a person will not
come out from mouth and at that moment a person feels that
someone is pressing the neck with full force and is choking
out the complete breath. A person tries to ease this pressure
with full force. He also calls for the object of his worship
for help. At that time, the body of such a person seems to be
lifeless. The evil spirits thus find their entry into the bodies.
The pitras (deceased family members) also come in the same
manner. In this way, the evil spirits make the bodies as their
abodes. The evil spirits does not leave the bodies so easily.


The Truth 85

As a result, the intellect and brain of such a person suffer a
great deal. A person becomes less active than before and the
memory becomes weaker and weaker. In short, the whole
nervous system of a person gets severely damaged. The reality
and the existence of evil spirits is far beyond from the
knowledge and reach of medical science as well as modern
science.
The number of evil spirits is continuously increasing. In
this universe, there are more than 10 evil spirits that can be
put after every human being. Also, ghosts live longer than
other living beings and has the age of 1000 years.
These evil spirits normally enter into the bodies of those
who have not sought the shelter of a true Guru. And, those
who got blessed with the Alive Holy Name, remains free from
all the ill effects of evil spirits. I have not given anything to
your mind and body. I have given the needed thing to your
soul only. I directly touched your soul (true-self) at the time
of ‘Naam Daan’ with my supreme concentration and makes
it awake that has helped in creating awareness and awakening
within you. Evil spirits now cannot have their ill effects on
you because I have mark the presence of supreme power
within you through my supreme concentration and you have
reached far higher as compared to those who does not have
the blessings of a true Guru with them. The disciples
associated with other religious/spiritual organizations remain
in the grip of superstitions of various kinds even after getting
blessed with the Holy Name. But, those who are associated
with Sahib Bandgi spiritual organization comes out of the grip
of superstitions soon after they get blessed with the true Alive
Holy Name. This is because people really feel the presence
of “Sahib” (Supreme Power) with them which continuously
gives complete protection from the influence of evil powers.


86 Sahib Bandgi

This is what makes me say again and again with complete
faith that ‘The thing I possess cannot be found anywhere else
in the universe’.
The suffering people go to ‘syanas’ (posing to have the
technique/method to cure the ill effects of evil spirits) for the
cure of their problems related to evil spirits. Such people don’t
realize that hypocrites are cheating them to earn their
livelihood.
The medical profession is a very noble profession. It is,
in fact, a profession of social service. But the doctors don’t
show due care to the poor patients. They care only for those
patients who belong to the upper strata of society. They have
turned this profession into a business for earning handsome
wealth, name and fame. The doctors have so far badly failed
to offer a complete cure against the diseases like fits, cancer,
diabetes, high blood pressure and the like. They tell the
patients that they will have to take the medicines till the last
breath of their lives. In other words, they will have to remain
dependant completely on the doctors.
Likewise, these ‘syanas’ can never provide relief to the
people suffering from problems associated with evil spirits.
They only pose to free people from ill effects of these evil
spirits. After all, what is the special thing associated with
Alive Holy Name. Kabir Sahib has said in this regard :
Bhoot pishach sab hoey nyara,
adhbhut Naam sadaa rakhwala.
The true Alive Holy Name gives full protection to the
being. Even ghosts get scared from it.
Thousands of people who were suffering from the ill
effects of evil spirits got cured after being blessed with Alive
Holy Name. It is this that has caused the mental disturbance


The Truth 87

to the hypocrites and the syanas. They are trying their best to
see to it that the people should remain entangled in their grip
and their own source of livelihood remains intact.
Often the devotees listen to the heavy criticism against
myself as well as against the Sahib Bandgi organisation and
feel somewhat perturbed. They also think perhaps the critics
do not have the true knowledge about Sahib Ji and Sahib
Bandgi organisation. But the devotees should not feel
disturbed. These hypocrites have gained a lot of knowledge
about our organization through my spiritual discourses,
literature books, website etc. They fully understand that
people who are attached with Sahib Bandgi spiritual
organisation are noble and have lovable manners. They do
not indulge in bad and evil activities. But still, such elements
avail every possible opportunity to defame us. The only
reason behind all this is that their sources of income are
suffering a set back. I have never worked for my personal
benefit. I am helping out the people to come out from the
grip of such hypocrites. In retaliation, they are spilling venom
against Sahib Bandgi organisation. Some call us as anti-
hindus while others call us as an atheist.
They want us to speak nothing about hypocrisy,
unscientific, unreal rites and rituals that have marred and
damaged the fair name of religion and the worship associated
with it.
Remember my words, just as vaccination helps in
preventing diseases, the true Alive Holy Name of ‘Sahib’
protects a being from all ill effects of evil spirits and at last
liberates the soul permanently from the endless cycle of birth
and death.

Some Experiences of

The Disciples

1. I was suffering from some nervous problem. I went to
various Syanas (experts in curing the evil effects of evil
spirits) for about 4-5 years but, in vain. Some associated my
trouble with the anger of the gods while others associated it
with Hatya (spirit of some deceased family member who
doesn’t find suitable abode).

By chance the doctor whom I used to visit for
purchasing the medicines was the follower of Sahib Bandgi
spiritual organisation. He advised me to go to Sahibji. I acted
upon his advice & narrated to my family members all that
Sahibji said. My elder sister-in-law guessed that this guru is
not like other ordinary ones. She lost no time in getting
blessed with Alive Holy Name. Then all other family
members also did the same. But I was still not a disciple. At
the instance of Sahibji I also got blessed with Alive Holy
Name. After it I began to enjoy life & soon recovered
completely.

I tell you an incident that disturbed me much. Someone
levelled a serious allegation against me. I remained upset for
15 days. One day, while I was lying on bed, I heard around
me the slogans being raised in honour of Gurudev (Sahib Ji).

The next day it was a full moon day. At the instance
of my younger brother, we went to Ranjadi Ashram, listened
to the satsang & offered salutations. Sahibji looked at me &
asked the reason of my frustration. I narrated the whole


The Truth 89

incident. Sahibji told me not to worry about & said that
Sahibji was with me. Right from that day I became normal. I
can say with confidence that in Sahibji I have found Param
Purush (Supreme Lord) Himself.

2. My husband was a dead drunkard and I was suffering from
the evil influence of Jalbir (a spirit that enters into the bodies
of females & tortures them) & Hatya. The Syanas had set up
some Mohras (articles of stones supposed to cure these evil
spirits) but they couldn’t give me any relief. Instead, I became
a mental case & remained in hospital for 6 months. By chance
I met some disciple of Sahibji. At his instance I went to
Sahibji. I attended 2 to 3 satsangs & got blessed with Alive
Holy Name. The power of Alive Holy Name not only cured
me but made the entire homely atmosphere pleasant. I
purchased a photo of Sahibji & began to worship in the right
earnest. Right from that day the whole atmosphere got
changed. My husband also started going to his work place
after offering salutations to Sahibji. He gave up taking wine
as well. He said that he experienced a change in heart just
on the very day Sahibji’s photo was placed. After about a
year he also got blessed with Alive Holy Name. By the grace
of Sahibji my home has become like heaven.

3. Earlier I was engaged in such dirty acts as were not easy
to give up. But by the grace of Sahibji I was able to free
myself from all these. I was earlier a devotee of Vaishno Mata.
(one of the forms of Durga) But I couldn’t get any peace of


90 Sahib Bandgi

mind. After seeking Sahibji’s shelter I have such a peace of
mind as I couldn’t dream of even. Satguru always protects
from dangers.
Once I was standing on the roof. I was about to fall
when I felt that Sahibji had again placed me on the roof. I
feel as if in Sahibji I have found Param Purush (Supreme
Lord) Himself.

4. Earlier I was a devotee of Shivji. I had his vision as well.
I attended the satsangs of some Guru as well. But all it
appeared as hypocrisy. I didn’t like satsangs of Sahibji as well
& used to denounce him. A boy who was Sahibji’s disciple
began to make me listen the discourses of Sahibji through a
cassette. I attained some knowledge & went to Sahibji to get
blessed with Alive Holy Name. I can’t describe the pleasure
that I experienced after seeking the shelter of Sahibji. I was
also able to see some miraculous things. All my desires began
to be fulfilled. My attachment with my relatives has got
decreased. I feel that our real world is far away from the
one we are living in.

Earlier I had been suffering from kidney pain. I spent
a lot on medicines but to no effect. After getting blessed with
Alive Holy Name I felt relief. I feel at all the time that there
is someone to protect me from troubles. I was also suffering
from the problem of walking in sleep. On many occasions I
couldn’t even know where I had reached. One night, as I
began to move out in my sleep, I felt as if some invisible
power had stopped me from going out. I remained standing
where I was. Sahibji never takes the credit of all these


The Truth 91

miracles.

When I move out, I remember Sahibji & I find that
the task at hand has been fulfilled. One day my foot slipped
from the stairs & I was about to fall. At that very moment I
felt as if some power had caught hold of me. On that very
day, in the evening time, I was again about to fall. I was
carrying vessels in my hands. All these were broken but I
remained where I was. It was, no doubt, Sahibji who had
come to my rescue.

5. Right from my childood I was interested in worship. I was
associated with a great organisation. I was the successor of
that organisation. I felt some shortcomings there & deserted
it. About 35 yrs. have passed & I have never visited there
again.

On 28/11/02 I got my daughter married. But after 20
days my son-in-law turned mad. It was an unbearable problem
for us. All kinds of treatments proved useless. He broke the
doors of his house & beat all the family members. He was
admitted in mental hospital as well for 10 days, but in vain.
We became helpless. I had made a firm determination to take
him to Sahibji but he wasn’t prepared to go there. Any how,
we managed to take him to Sahibji. A miracle happened. My
son-in-law got cured. I thought that he alone could be my
Satguru. Then after testing for six months, I along with my
family members got blessed with Alive Holy Name.

6. From the very beginning I had an inclination for worship.
At that time we lived in U.P. If we found any sage, we used
to follow him. The family members watched us lest we should
run away. I was not interested in studies. One day, on my
way to school, I found that a satsang was being held. The
very sight of Sahibji charmed me. At that time I was 12 years
old. Then I started attending satsang daily. I continued it for
about one year. In the meantime the family members had got
blessed with Alive Holy Name. Being young I wasn’t allowed
to do so.

One day I took wine and remained intoxicated. The
family members decided to make me to Sahib Ji to get blessed
with Alive Holy Name so that I may not get spoiled. At the
age of thirteen I went to Sahibji to get blessed with Naam.
At that time Sahibji was alone. He laughed on seeing me &
asked what do you want? I said that I want to get blessed
with ‘Naam’. At this Sahibji blessed me with ‘Naam’ & we
returned back to home. After that the grace of Sahibji
remained with me. When I sat for meditation, a ray of light
emanated from my forehead & my surti (concentration)
reached direct to the abode of Sahibji. The severities of hot
& cold mattered nothing to me.

After coming to Jammu I was once going to the
Ashram at Akhnoor. The bridge had got damaged as a result
of flood & the people went across the river by boat. But at
that time even the boat service was not available. All the
passengers returned back but I lay there on the bank of the
river. At night there came a terrible storm. I found many
soldiers (evil spirits) firing shots at me from all sides. A line
appeared to be formed all around me. Their bullets couldn’t
enter that line. I continued to see this show for half an hour.


The Truth 93

As I greeted them with the word ‘Sahib Bandgi’, all of them
disappeared.

There came a time when I ceased to have sleep. I
didn’t feel hunger & thirst even. I remained at all the time
engrossed in the thoughts of Sahibji. My body looked as light
as a flower. The people took me as a mad fellow. At one time,
I also began to think if I had really turned mad. Then I
requested Gurudev to restore my sleep to me. Since then I
feel the sensation of hot & cold as before.
I am a mason by profession. Once Gurudev asked me
to make three Chimneys. We began the work at 6 a.m. &
made two chimneys by 6:30 p.m. But we couldn’t make the
third one. The reason was that gurudev was standing nearby
with an umbrella in hand. As soon as one was near
completion, he got it dismantled. He did so again & again.
When Gurudev asked me again to make it, I said, though
unknowingly, “Gurudev! you should make it for yourself.”
Gurudev said, “Don’t feel annoyed, my child.” Hearing this
I realized my mistake & falling on his feet begged pardon. I
couldn’t pass the test.
Even today that very mistake disturbs me. So I want
to request all the followers with folded hands not to commit
such like mistake.

Kunjwani.

7. I had some problem in my leg. I couldn’t perform my job
well. I spoiled about 2½ years in consulting Syanas. Their
techniques failed to do any good to me. I had to spend about
500 to 800 rupees per month. They charged Rs. 1000 for
home visit. Then I consulted the doctors. I wasted about 60


94 Sahib Bandgi

to 70 thousand Rupees but in vain. I happened to meet a
teacher who took me to Sahibji. I felt 25% relief in the very
first satsang I attended. Then after attending about four
satsangs I got blessed with ‘Naam’. Within a month I got
relief from my problem & was able to do my work well.
One day I was going to Akhnoor on foot. As I tried to
cross the road, a fast moving vehicle came very near to me.
Some invisible power pushed me aside. There is another
incident to cite. I had gone to Delhi. I was crossing the railway
track. In the meantime a train came from behind. There as
well I was saved by Sahibji who pushed me aside.

8. Soon after passing her TDC part-II, my elder daughter fell
ill. I had lost all hopes of her survival. Syanas & sages failed
to do any good to her. Disciples of one sage suggested to
me to get blessed with ‘Naam’ as that would relieve him from
all his problems. I was forced to do so. In a period of about
2-3 years I spent about Rs. One lakh at the instance of that
sage. The economic condition of my family grew worse. On
learning about Sahibji, I sent both of my daughters for getting
blessed with ‘Naam’. Right from the day of getting blessed
with Naam, my elder daughter began to recover & gradually
she became quite well. Seeing all this I also got blessed with
Naam. But, that hypocrite Guru didn’t want to let me go out
of his fold. He sent his disciples to me but I didn’t respond.
After some time I came to know of his death on account of
heart attack. Anyhow, my elder daughter did her M.A, B.Ed.
& is now serving as a lecturer in some govt. school. I am


The Truth 95

pleased to see all this all by the grace of Sahib Ji.

9. I read in books about the power in the Holy Name of
Sahibji. I thought to test it. So I got blessed with Naam (Holy
Name). Within a year I experienced the power of ‘Naam’.
There is an incident to tell. One night it was raining. I was
going along Talab Tillo road at a great speed. There was a
pit on the way that had got filled with water. On reaching
near the pit I felt as if someone had turned my motor cycle
aside. In order to find the fact, next day I drove back on my
motorcycle to the same side. Reaching there I found a big
pit which was nearly two feet deep. I, at once, realized that
it was the miracle of Sahibji. Seeking the shelter of Sahibji
has saved me from purposeless wanderings.
