Our life seems to have become meaningless. Inwardly

> Right from the very beginning of this universe, man has\
> been engaged in the search of that Super-power which he\
> believes is the controller of this entire cosmos. After all,\
> why has man been so much curious to know and to realise\
> God (Param Purush)\
> There are four main reasons behind all this---\
> **1**. In reality, the soul felt, it had got separated from\
> someone. It couldn't understand as to what it lacked.

It is this feeling that made it go in search of God.

> **2**. The sorrows and sufferings of the world and the fear\
> of death encouraged him to move in search of eternal\
> pleasures and immortality. Thus he moved in search\
> of God for attaining these objects.
>
> **3**. On seeing the sun, the moon and the stars etc., he\
> felt that it was not an ordinary phenomenon. There\
> must be some super-power that has created all this.

This thought made him move in search of Him.

> **4**. With the passage of time, as man gained consciousness,\
> he thought that the life doesn't come to an end with\
> the death of this physical body. There is some such\
> element in man that remains alive even after death.
>
> Thus, knowing that the soul is immortal, man began\
> to make a search of God.
>
> Just as man has continuously been trying to know more\
> and more about the solar system, he has been trying to know\
> more and more about God as well.
>
> The devotion and worship of God had begun right from\
> the vedic era. On being influenced by the charming and

**6**

> **Crossing The Ocean Of Life With The Grace Of Satguru** **7**
>
> beautiful sceneries of natural objects, man began to worship\
> them. Some thought that water was the sustainer of life\
> because life without it was impossible and as such they began\
> to worship water itself. Likewise, some began to worship\
> fire; some began to worship the earth and the air while others\
> began to worship the sky taking it as the most powerful object.
>
> Thus man began to worship the objects of nature in\
> different ways.
>
> The people had great devotion and regard for the vedas\
> because these were the oldest scriptures of the world. Finding\
> different view points about God in the vedas, man also began\
> to accept His presence according to different view points.\
> In vedas, the different concepts about God are as under---\
> According to Rigveda, God is formless. According to\
> Yajurved, God has a definite form. According to Athrav ved,\
> performance of actions and deeds alone is God while\
> according to Samved, the soul itself is God.
>
> Being complex in nature, it was not in the power of all\
> to understand them. So the philosophers produced six shastras\
> out of these four vedas. The sage Gautam Rishi produced\
> Nyaya Shastra from Rig veda; Sage Jaimini produced\
> Mimansa Shastra from Yajur ved; Sage Vyas Muni produced\
> Vedant Shastra from Samved while the sage Kapil produced\
> Sankhya Shastra from Athrav Ved. From Athrav Ved itself\
> sage Patanjli produced Yog Shastra while the sage Kanad\
> produced Vaisheshak Shastra. As these shastras were produced\
> by different sages, there was some difference in their view\
> points. These sages don't appear to agree to a single view\
> point. That is why the Nyaya Shastra describes man as\
> subordinate to actions and deeds. According to it, not a single\
> leaf even can make any movement without the will of God.\
> Mimansa Shastra has accorded prime place to deeds and
>
> **8** **Sahib Bandgi**
>
> actions. According to it, man attains the form of life after his\
> death as per his deeds. Vaisheshak Shastra also says the same\
> thing.
>
> Nyaya Shastra considers the soul itself as God. It says,\
> "It is I who is Brahm (God) himself." In Yog Shastra,\
> importance has been given to Yog itself. According to it,\
> the jiva will cross the ocean of births and deaths only after\
> knowing the God particle. According to the Sankhya Shastra,\
> the Soul as well as God are in no way attached to the material\
> world. Everything--good or bad--is nothing but illusion.\
> Neither the soul does any action nor does it reap any fruit.\
> To have knowledge of God, we shall have to keep our soul\
> separate from mind.
>
> One Shastra describes God as having a form; the other\
> describes Him as formless while the 3rd one attaches the\
> highest importance to Karma. In this way, all are trying to\
> present His identity according to their own view points. *Kabir*

*Sahib says that the contradictory view points presented*

*through these shastras have prevented man from knowing*

*the true identity of God.*

> For the whole of mankind there has to be one God. Then\

> The Christians take God as formless. Jesus has time and\

> His only son.
>
> Muslims also believe that God is formless. They call\

> identity as that of a formless super-power.

Our Hindu religion also accepts that God is formless

> **Crossing The Ocean Of Life With The Grace Of Satguru** **9**

> though His identity as a super-power with form (Sagun) has\

>
> According to Buddhism, the soul itself is God. In the\

That is why Sahibji has said---

*Sahib Itna Deejiye, Jamey Kutumb Samaye.*

*Main Bhi Bhookha Na Rahun, Sadhu Na Bhukha Jaye.*

> **O God! Give me wealth enough to support my family**\
> **and to feed the sage if any that comes to my house.**
>
> When the fire grows hot, it can burn even the wet wood.\
> Likewise, sin will also increase alongwith increase in greed.\
> Attachment is also very dangerous.
>
> *Moh Sakal Vyadhin Ko Moola, Ta Te Upjat Bahu Vidhi Soola.*\
> **This attachment is also the root cause of diseases.**
>
> **20** **Sahib Bandgi**
>
> All the jivas have got entangled in the grip of attachment.\
> Then comes the ego that is more dangerous than these. It\
> has been described as Jheeni Maya (ethereal matter).

*Moti Maya Sabb Tajain, Gheeni Taji Na Jaye.*

*Peer Paigamber Auliya, Jheeni Saban Ko Khaye.*

> **It is easy to part with material Maya (wealth), but it**\
> **is not easy to part with the ethereal one. It is the ethereal**\
> **Maya that has devoured even the great sages.**
>
> It is the ego that brings anger. An egotist doesn't tolerate\
> even a slightest remark against his nature. Ego may be related\
> to wealth, power, caste, learning or complexion. Never be\
> proud of anything. If your words are full of ego, you will\
> pour venom. Our words must be pleasing to others. In my\
> opinion, an egotist gives the proof of his weakness alone.\
> The more egotist a person is, the more ignorant he will be.\
> This is because an egotist always tries to frighten others. A\
> wealthy man will boast of his wealth before a comparatively\
> less wealthy person and never before a more wealthy one.\
> I find that some mahatmas (sages) also try to frighten others\
> with their long grown hair and spread of chandan on forehead.\
> They demand respect from others. But remember! he who\
> tries to frighten others, gets himself frightened from some\
> one stronger than him.
>
> It is easy to pose as a mahatma and get some fame but\
> it is very difficult to bear insult. The noble and enlightened\
> souls know that they will have to suffer humiliation in the\

> Once a head master came to Ranjri. He gave me one\

speaking against you and I, at once, guessed that some

enlightened soul must have arrived."

Sahibji has said---

All this is the play of Munn.

> *Niranjan* *Dhan* *Tumra* *Durbar,*
>
> *Jahan* *Tanik* *Na* *Neyaye* *Vichar.*

*Rung Mahal Mein Basein Muskarey, Pas Terey Sardar.*

> *Dhoor* *Dhoop* *Mein* *Sadhu* *Virajain,*
>
> *Bhaye* *Jo* *Bhav* *Nidhi* *Par.*

*Veshya oodhe Khasa Malamal, Gal Motiyan Ko Har.*

*Pativrata Ko Milay Na Khadi, Sookha Niras Ahar.*

*Pakhandi Ko Jug Mein Aadar, Sant Ko Kahain Labar.*

*Agyani Ko Param Viveki, Gyani Ko Mood Ganwar.*

*Kah-Hin Kabir Faqir Pukari, Ulta Sabb Vyovahar.*

*Sanch Kahe Jug Maran Dhaye, Jhuthan Ko Etbar.*

**What a lovely world has Niranjan created. Everything**

**in this world is abnormal. There is nothing like justice**

**and fair play here. Here hypocrites are honoured as great**

**learned persons while the Sants are defamed as ignorant**

**ones. The prostitutes get all the available facilities while**

**the virtuous women have to lead a simple life. A preacher**

**of truth is tortured while a liar is honoured. In this world**

**those who come forward to guide the people along the**

**path of truth are denounced in every possible manner.**

This dangerous Mind is proving a great hurdle in the

path of letting the Hansa realise its true identity. It tries its

best to keep you ignorant about everything. No doubt, the

whole of the creation is due to Munn alone.

With folded hands, Dharam Dass Ji tells the seekers

after truth the way he attained salvation and requests them

to do the same with the power of Naam. Let this holy Naam

spread itself in your entire body and illuminate it. With the

passage of time you will feel that your hidden powers have

begun to make their appearance. These powers will enable

you to lead a worthy life.

> *Shabad Nij Sar Hai,* *Jo Guru Diya Bataye.*

*Balihari Wa Gurun Ki, Sish Viyog Na Jaye.*

Through Naam the Satguru gives a sweet and charming

music to the 'Sar Shabad' lying in the interior of the disciple.

He uses all possible ways and means to let the dormant seed

in us take the form of a mighty tree.

If you drown yourself deep in the nectar of Naam, You

will find that it burns in the begining but heals afterwards.

Sahib Kabir Ji burnt the unscientific and unreal views

of Dharam Dass Ji regarding religion and the achievement

of Parampurush. Dharam Dass Ji continued to suffer from

the pains of these burns for six months. Sahib Ji had termed

his modes of worship as 'Pakhands'. It was really very

difficult for him to digest it.

> Sahibji said,\

*Kaun tumari utpati keeni. Kisne tum ko mala deeni.*

*Kaun Guru deeno updesh. Utaro mala karo adesh.*

**Sahib said :**

Gorakh :

*Keya lai utho keya lai baitho, raho kaun ki chhaya.*

*Kaun mah niranjan pekho, kaise tyagi maya.*

> I move about in the company of one and live under the\

> In this way Gorakh Nath entered into a great dialogue\

> Again, once Gorakh Nathji *said* to Sahibji, "I'll hide\

come for the real purpose of worship. Thirdly, my back biters

are sending people to me. These are the intellectuals who

include the social reformers. They come to know the cause

behind our opposition. When their misunderstandings and

doubts are cleared, they come forward to get blessed with

the holy Naam. Thus my back biters are sending to me very

good persons. So I advise my followers not to bother about

our denounciation. Let the dogs bark if they desire so.

Remember! Two things happen when some dog barks. Either

it will die or it will go mad if it continues to bark.

While barking, a dog applies its full force. The veins

of its throat swell and if it continues to do so for 3 to 4

hours at a stretch, it will die.

**Sahibji advises us to remain absorbed in reciting the**

**it. Let the fellow go to hell if he desires so.**

**7. Why To Denounce The Sants**

From the very beginning there were great Sants who

worked for the welfare of the society all through their lives.

The great Sants like Nanakji, Paltoo Sahib, Dadu Dayal ji, Ravi

Dass ji and the like were never given due respect and honour

> **Crossing The Ocean Of Life With The Grace Of Satguru** **61**
>
> during their life time. But after their departure from the world,\
> the intellectuals on being influenced by their teachings, wrote\
> books in recognition of their great services. But could such\
> things give those holy Sants the respect they deserved. After\
> their departure from the world the people began to follow the\
> path shown by them. It was good but it would have been better\
> if such representatives of God had been shown due reverence\
> and respect in their very life time.

> and for taking them to Amarlok. But how foolish do the\

*Mein Heyr Rahun Naina, So Neh Lagai.*

The love with the Satguru is infact, the love with the

two eyes wherein one finds the glimpse of parampurush.

And remember! The true Satguru is he in whose eyes you

see some glimpse of parampurush. We have not seen the

Parampurush but he who has seen Him, has some definite

glimpse of Him or some rays of Him floating in his eyes.

In the interior of a person, some echoes of melodious heavenly

songs he has heard of, definitely remain preserved.

*Mein Heyr Rahun Naina So Neh Lagae.*

*Rah Chalat Mohi Mili Gye Satguru,*

> *So* *Sukh* *Baran* *Na* *Jayi.*

Only a person, who walks and searches, becomes lucky

enough to seek the shelter of a Satguru. Those who don't

make a search, can't seek the shelter of a Satguru.To become

a shish, the first step is to become a student. Without becoming

a student, one can't expect to become a shish.

*Rah Chalat Mohi Mili Gye Satguru, So Sukh Barni Na Jayi.*

*Ji Darr Raha Tha Jisse, Wohi Baat Ho Geyi.*

*Satguru Jabb Milta Hai.Deh Ke Daras Mohi Boraye\...\...\...*

The very sight of a Satguru makes a shish lose his sense

for the time being. The meeting between a Guru and shish

can't be called a meeting in the real sense unless such a

thing happens. A real Guru is he in whose presence you feel

as if your very heart has been stolen.

We call God by the Naame of Hari which literary means

a thief. In no other country God is called by this Naame. It is

only the highly intellectual ones who can use such a word for

parampurush. A single glance of parampurush makes a devotee

part with even his highly valuable possessions. At first, such a

thing happens in the presence of a Satguru who is an inseparable

part of parampurush.

his blessings at any moment. A fraction of the dazzling light

kindling inside a Satguru is sufficent to remove the darkness

residing in the heart of a disciple.

When such a thing happens, there arises an ir-resistible

desire to meet the Satguru. The previous meetings are only

a sort of dialogue with him. To have such a desire, there is

a need to understand the Satguru in the real sense.

Satguru is the living form of Parampurush. His one hand

is in the hand of disciple and the other one is in the hand of

Parampurush.

He is limitless and it is not possible to bring him within

limits. He can't be imprisoned in a temple or a mosque. There

is no mantra, by which we can call him in any ritual or

ceremony. He is present everywhere. His presence can be

felt, by looking into the eyes of a Satguru who has seen the

Parampurush with his own eyes. Looking into the eyes of a

Satguru or that of a parampurush is the same thing.

This is the first event. When the lips taste a little nectar,

a desire to drink more and more arises. A strong desire, a

thirst arises inside a disciple. There is a great difference

between thirst and desire.

Normally people have desire but no thirst. The only

condition is to arouse a thirst. Only a few are able to fulfil

Earlier, the behaviour was being controlled by mind and
