The one, who remains in serving his guru, can be called as

claim to be a sevak (servant).

#### Few Words

**"The thing I possess, cannot be found anywhere in
this universe"**. I am not this saying with ego. There is no
ego here. It is different matter, however people take their
own meaning with their level of understanding. I am
saying with innate belief. I strongly despise (condemn)
ego, I consider ego as cancer which feeds on the body, ego
eats wisdom. However much knowledgeable a person
might be, still ego will destroy him. That is the reason why
I am not saying out of ego, it is true I can give proof for it.
Believe in the truth of my saying, I am not saying out of
ego. I speak with the spiritual discrimination (vivek). I can
prove my words.
We see several Religions (Mat-matantar-streams of
Bhakti) in our surroundings. If you see honestly, you will
get to know that 70% people consume flesh and liquor.
Though they give a speech on Bhakti, though they talk on
Sant Matt however, their habits of eating, drinking, and
their conduct are improper. Even their actions are not good,
it is very mean. As a Naami, your eating habits are good,
even your actions are meritorious. They may be cheats,
hypocrites and deceptive but you have a stable life. Even if
you want, you can do no wrong. A power will alert you.
This change is evident in every Naami’s life. You are
matchless while taking security measures, in the matter of
Gyaan; you are supreme knower (param gyaani). What to
do and what not to do, even in this, you do not need
anyone’s guidance. Just as you are about to do any
mistake, you will get an inner prompting. That power will
alert you and warn you not to do. You have this knowledge
and you can sense it. You are unique in the field of
devotion. When you look at others, you will get to know
that they worship Shiva, sometimes Goddess Kali and
sometimes others. We can see the evidence of this. They
are under delusion, they are lost. You know how evil
spirits affects and you are aware of it.


The Real Disciple 5
You have a strong on Bhakti. You are different from
others in this World. Every person in this world is
intoxicated and trapped by their Minds. Mind (Kal), makes
them dance to his commands but you are free from this.
Mind cannot influence you.
Sahib Kabir says—
_Naam Hoye Toh Math Namavey|
Na Toh Yaha Maan Baandh Nachaavey||_
Certainly, Mind cannot exercise its force on you. Mind
is powerless. It makes everyone dance to his tunes. All are
afflicted with the intoxication of Illusion (Maya), but you
are free from Mind’s grip. When Mind’s intoxication takes
effect, it activates Kaam, Anger, etc. These are present in
you but are under full control and cannot harm you. In your
Panth, there are wonderful powers. You do not harm
anyone with your thoughts, words, and deeds. You have
inner peace and happiness. A power directs you therefore,
you are very secure. Demons and Evil spirits cannot come
near you. When you come across persons affected by evil
spirits, if you sit with him and do Naam Bhajan, the spirit
will run away from there. No magic, no spell, no
supernatural power can harm you.
Once, Dharmadas felt disturbed. Kabir sahib gave him
his position and he was leaving. He said, "Kalpurush is
very powerful, he has bound everyone, how is it possible
for me? How can I induce people in Satya Bhakti?" Sahibji
told him not to worry.
_Purush Shakti Jab Aan Samai|
Tab Nahi Rokey Kaal Kasaai||_
Sahibji said when power of Param purush enters; Kaal
(mind) cannot do anything. The day when you take Sat
Naam, the power of Param Purush will be filled in you.
Then Kaal cannot influence or force you.
A power resides within you, which you can strongly
sense more certainly than I would say, it does. You do not
require any clarification from me on anything; my
vibration is with you, this alone can teach you. If I count


6 Sahib Bandgi
numbers in reversely in satsang, then you too can grasp
that, listening to what I say, you will never be bored. To
make you understand with words is just an excuse. Ravan
did not change his heart, even when Ramji was there.
Duriyodhan did not change his heart, even when Krishnaji
was there, but then Sahib says:
_Satguru mor rangrej| Chunari mori rang daari||_
In all these three worlds of illusion, formless Mind
keeps the Surti (Dhyaan) entangled and deprive it from
Spiritual wisdom (Atma Gyaan). Mind never allows the
Surti to go towards the Spirit (Atma). 1)Ami Surti-
intensifies pleasure, 2)Mool Surti -Fundamental
concentration for all actions,3)Chamak Surti-It activates
sense organs, 4) Shunya Surti-Withdrawal of
Concentration,5)Nischay Surti-discriminates,6)Gyaan
Surti-It gives perceives data from senses and 7)Hriday
Surti-prompts action, all the above aspects of Surtis helps
in identifying what is accomplished and what is not and the
quality, taste etc. With all these seven Surtis, world is
immersed in Dharma (Righteousness)-Karma(Action),
Krut-Accomplishment)-Akrut-Non-accomplishment. All
these things are related to the perishable body and not to
the immortal Atma. Individual has become a slave. It is
only a real Satguru, who can release the grip of Mind on
Surti. Removing the mind, he makes us centered on Spirit-
Atma. Mind involves the Surti in the Tri-Gunas (Satva,
Rajo and Tamo), to activate Thought-Mann, Intellect-
Buddhi, Memory-Chitt and Ego-Ahankar and indulges in
the worlds through Kama (desire), Krodha (anger), Lobha
(greed), Moha (attachment), Mada (pride) and Maathsarya
(envy) all of that makes the Atma forget his Mooldhaam
(Satlok- Eternal world).
When Satguru releases the Surti from all the unreal
entanglements of the world and focuses it on Atma then the
realisation of Atma (Spirit) is attained. During the
Naamdan (initiation), Satguru lets in his disciple the


The Real Disciple 7
power that separates the Surti from Mind and Maya. Then
the disciple discharging his duties stays Atma centric
(opposed to Mind centric).
Concentration is not one-pointed therefore mistakes
happen. Atma is illumined in everyone. Just as how a child
can identify its mother. Similarly, Surti (Dhyaan) will be
towards Atma, then Mind cannot influence Surti. Surti is
scattered. Virus attacks blood because blood has all the
nutrients in it. In the similar manner, the army of mind,
namely the Trigunas and six vices (as mentioned above),
attacks on Surti. This is the source for them. Disease is due
to carelessness in food regiment (discipline). Subjugate the
six vices with Surti, but not the senses. If you suppress
hunger, thirst, fecal matters, etc., it may suppress the
senses and makes it weak but this will not help achieve
one-pointedness-Dhyaan (Ekagrata). It is important to take
care of Surti, it is the goal of Adhyatma.
_Surti Mey Hai Rachiyo Sansaara, Surti Ka Hai Khel Sara||_
There is nothing greater than devotion to Sadguru. It is
only with the grace of Satguru, it is possible to attain one-
pointedness (Dhyaan). For those who are Sadguru-centric
(Gurumukh), there is a special place in Amarlok. The one
with whom he is pleased, his fortunes cannot be
compared. _'Guru Bhakth Aaphi Tarey, Aurhi Lei Ubar_ |'. It
is not only a disciple of Satguru who crosses the worldly
ocean of Sansaar and all those who are around him also
receive benefit.


8 Sahib Bandgi

#### 1. The Real Disciple

_Shishya Ko Aisa Chahiye, Guru Rijaye Aapa Khoy||_
Please your Satguru by sacrificing the ego and
individuality. This is the primary obligation of the disciple.
On the day of Naam Diksha (Initiation), I have asked for
three things; your individuality, your Mind and your
Possessions. On this condition, Naam was bestowed on
you.
_Pehele Daata Shishya Bhaya, Jin Tan Man Arpa Shish|
Piche Data Guru Bhaya, Jin Naam Diya Bakshish||_
With your Eyes closed, you have offered your
individuality, your Mind and your Possessions from your
Heart. I have returned to you your individuality and
possessions for, you need to serve your family who
depends on you. However, I have not returned your Mind. I
have asked you to keep it with me. I have partly released
your Mind so that, you can perform your worldly
obligations. Just as, you tie a Cow to a pole with a rope, so
that it can move a little for grazing. If the rope is too short,
it will stay very close to the pole. The same conditions
apply to you. It is left to you to use as little rope as needed.
If you are centered always on Satguru (Guru Mukh), you
will find that Satguru will go on reducing the length of the
rope. If it is drastically reduced, you may even lose the
interest in going home. Mind will become detached. For
this reason, the length of the rope is not reduced.
Nevertheless, understand this truth. Satguru expects that
the Mind should be engaged with the world as little as
needed. Do not be immersed in Wealth, Money,
Enjoyment, Status, etc. At all times, keep your thought
(Concentrated) on Satguru. Always be in remembrance of
Satguru, keep away from worldly thought.
Mind is Niranjan (Formless God) Himself. The battle is
with the Mind. The thing Satguru has given is for defeating
the Mind only. Now the work gets easy. It is impossible to
fight the Mind otherwise without that thing which Satguru


The Real Disciple 9
gave. Therefore, the disciple should defeat his mind in the
battle with the help of the thing- Naam and please the
Satguru. Satguru expects that its disciple should check the
tendencies of his Mind. With the blessing of Naam,
Satguru has given salvation; Satguru can easily liberate
Disciple from the clutches of Mind & illusion in this life
only (Jeevan Mukta), but Satguru doesn't like that. Satguru
expects Disciple to battle the Mind & defeat it on his own
& receive the love of Satguru.
There is a way to please Satguru that is to follow the
path shown by him. Ignoring the promptings of the Mind,
etc and follow Satguru.
_Ban Ja Kutta Satguru Ka, Sumir Le Uska Naav|
Gale Mey Uski Jebdi, Jitt Kichey Titt Jau||_
Follow the direction shown without any intervention of
any hesitation, and use of cleverness, discrimination, and
ego. Ignoring all the doubts, pursue the path shown by
Satguru. He will give both internal and external
indications. Grasp the direction given and meticulously
follow. There won’t be any reactions left.
_Guru Aagya Nirkhat Rahe, Jaise Maani Hi Bhujang|
Kahe Kabir Dharmadas Se, Yaha Gurumukh Ko Aang||_
Satguru Bhakti means, meticulously following the
directions given by Satguru with love. The proposal which
is been turned down should never be pursued. That which
is instructed, should be followed as long as one lives.
Serving with Wealth is a good effort, serving Satguru with
the bodily (physically) is even better indeed. However
serving Satguru with the Mind is a very difficult Job. If
there is involvement of Ego, then it will be impossible to
serve Guru with Mind. To remove the individuality is very
difficult. For this reason, only a rare individual can perform
service to his Guru with his Mind, in this Guru should be
taken as Param Purush himself. His every instruction
should be taken as that of Parampurush himself, keep faith
in this. Satguru Bhakti is established on this faith. Do not
allow any confusion to intercede in this. Nevertheless,


10 Sahib Bandgi
serving the Satguru in any form is desirable one, because
Mind never likes to let anyone offer his service to Guru. It
is only the service to a Satguru that can help you.
Once Dharmadas asked Kabir Sahib:
_Dharmadas Vinanti Karey, Hiye Mey Bahu Hulsaye|
Hey Swami Muj Din Ko, Dijey Amal Bataye||
Kon Amal Karna Chahey, Jo Tum Hoye Dayal|
Kya Antar Hum Tum Mey, Isey Karo Nihal||_
Dharmadas asked Kabir Sahib as to what work would
please him the most. What is the difference between you
and me? Why should we please you?
Sahibji says:
_Dharmadas Mam Kahat Hu, Jo Hey Nikii Baat|
Hum Tum Mey Antar Nahi, Fakta Bhram Ki Bhrant||
Aganpunj Kabirji, Chingari Sab Daas|
Chingari Aur Agan Mey, Kya Kijey Vishwas||_
Sahibji says, just as there is a difference between Fire
and flying spark of fire, so is the difference between you
and me.
Dharamdasji asks:
_Aganpunj Hey Swamiya, Jadan Karde Jatt|
Hum Mey Shakti Kyu Nahi, Issey Karey Pragat||
Tum Toh Sab Kuch Kar Sako, Ho Sab Karne Yog|
Karna Chahte Jo Hum, Waha Bhi Hoth Ayog||_
Dharmadasji says that Sahib has immense and
unlimited power. You can accomplish anything you want,
but why can't we?
Sahibji says:
_Dharmarup Ahi Durr Hey, Rahi Ahi Par Chay|
Hum Mey Yaha Vyapey Nahi, Yo Samjo Maan Maay||
Tum Trigun Ki Bhakti Mey, Urjey Ho Sab Log|
Humsey Trigun Darat Hey, You Hum Jadan Yog||_
Sahibji says that it is because you are covered in the
sheet of Maya, whereas I am not. You are engaged in the
worship of trinity (Trigun). Whereas, trinity Gods stays
fearful of me.
Dharmadasji asks:
_Kyu Trigun Tum Se Darey, Hey Guru Din Dayal|_


The Real Disciple 11
_Jab Tum Hum Sab Ek Hey, Tumsey Kyu Niral||
Tathva Prakruti Hey Vahi, Aur Brahma Ka Ansh|
Kehi Karan Antar Pado, Hey Guru Bhrama Hi Dhans||_
Dharamadasji asks,
Why are the trinity fearful of you? When all of us are
one, part of one Brahm, then what is difference between us
and how are you unique from us? Sahibji says:
_Humsey Trigun Bhaya, Hum Trigun Mey Nahi|
Tum Sab Trigun Sey Bhaye, Yu Samjo Maan Mahi||
Tum Par Toh Trigun Ki, Chay Rahi Jo Dhur|
Jo Tum Ahehi Chutey, Tab Hum Kare Kabul||_
Sahibji says; your body is born of Trigunas (Satwa,
Rajas and Tamas). Whereas Trigunas are born out of us
and I am not born out of Trigunas. I am beyond it.
Dharmadasji says:
_Antar Tumhara Sab Sunna, Maan Buddhi Chitt Laye|
Ab Nikal Is Rah Se, Dijey Mohey Batay||
Kon Yatna Se Uttru, So Kahiye Pragatay|
Jonn Dhur Chahi Hui, Tako Yatna Bataye||_
Dharmadasji requests Sahibji to remove him out of the
Trigunas. Kindly show me the way to extricate from
Triguna Maya. Sahibji says:
_Pratam Sat Sangat Karo, Punaha Sant Ki Sev|
Yatey Sabkuch Bann Padey, Yu Jano Maan Bhev||_
Sahibji directs Dharmadas to be in the company of Sant
and serve them. From that, you will find your way.
_Satguru Ki Seva Karey, Pavey Parvana|
Kahe Kabir Dharmadas Se, Tehi Kaal Darana||_
It is important to serve and be devoted to Satguru
(Satguru Bhakti). He will release you from the world of
Kalpurush and take you to his world, Amarlok.
It is the duty of the disciple to serve his Guru. Disciple
has four primary duties towards his Guru.
Firstly-
_Tann Maan Dhan Se Guru Ki Seva||_
Seva should be done in all these three aspects. Secondly-
_Dwitiya Seva Mey Vishay Ko Tyagey||_


12 Sahib Bandgi
It means while discharging the seva avoid mental
fatigue. Do not deviate from service due to the influence of
Maya. Give up all kind of desires and engage in service.
Thirdly-
_Tritiya Maan Ahankar Na Aney||_
Do not develop Ego while performing service. Be a
servant at the Holy feet of Satguru. Do not become heavy
headed. Do not focus on the growth of your image. If you
remain at feet of Satguru, then there is no chance of failure,
but if you walk heavy headed you may fall and break
everything. Be thankful to Guru for the opportunity of
seva.
_Kakh Ho Guru Ke Charano Mey, Toh Tuje Manzil Miley||_
Carry on your service quietly.
Fourthly-
_Chauthey Guru Key Bachan Pratiti|
Jo Koi Maney Chaley Jum Jiti||_
Keep faith in the words of Satguru. This way, disciple
has four duties to discharge towards his Guru. However,
two of them are supreme.
_Guru Seva Baaki Nischay Kar||_
One is the service and the other is faith. Both internal
and external faith in the Sar Shabd. Whatever He says
should be accepted in Faith. Accepting Him as
Parampurush, in the core of the heart follow His
promptings. The one who meticulously observes this is a
true disciple (Sachcha Shishya).He is centered on Guru
(Guru Mukh) and He is a devotee of Guru (Guru Bhakth).
This devotion to the Guru will confer liberation.
_Guru Samarth Jehi Sir Khadey, Kami Kah Ko Daas|
Riddhi Siddhi Seva Karey, Mukti Na Chadey Saat||_
Parampurush is Soundless Sound (Nir dwand), free
from Maya, free from elements. It is impossible to describe
Him or explain Him. You cannot comprehend Him.
Whereas when Satguru appears in Maya with Mind and
senses, He can make you understand. Living in Maya, He
is beyond it, unaffected. His appearance in Maya facilitates


The Real Disciple 13
your understanding correctly. However, Parampurush will
not reach out Himself to you in this. On your own effort,
you cannot comprehend Parampurush. Therefore,
attempting to show devotion to Parampurush is like
throwing stone on Moon. Kabir Sahibji told Dharamdas
that showing devotion to Parampurush is meaningless,
unhelpful and useless.
Just as you cannot look at the Sun with physical Eye
openly, because it will blind you. However, you can look at
the Moon whose light is gentle and it is a reflection of
Sunlight itself. Similarly, Satguru is easy to approach. The
supreme power is active in Satguru.
_Satyapurush Ki Aarasi, Santan Keri Deh|
Lakha Jo Chahey Alakh Ko, Inhi Mey Lakh Leh||_
That is why, be devoted to Satguru (Satguru Bhakti).
I am not proud of my seat but it is my innate duty to
help you in understanding duties of Disciple towards his
Guru. It is my belief that Guru and Shishya should be
complimenting each other. If there is no Guru, where is the
need of Disciple! If there is no disciple, where is the need
for a Guru?
There was a group of Hans, living on the sea. They had
a mutually good relation with the sea. The friendship was
such that whatever said by one is accepted by the other,
there was no conflict. Where there is ego, friendship cannot
exist.
One day the sea told the Hansas that you all exist in me,
I am so expansive. Hearing the voice of ego of sea, the
Hansas were shaken and they said that they are very
beautiful. When one shows love the other also respond;
when one displays ego the other also shows his ego.
Hansas by nature, they are good. Sometime an ugly
man becomes enduring and sometime a good-looking man
is considered as bad in character. It means, character is not
defined by beauty of a person. Beauty lies in character.
Nevertheless, if both beauty and character exist in one,


14 Sahib Bandgi
what to say of it? Parampurush is beauty Himself. Even the
brilliance of crores of Suns is nothing compared to him. He
speaks with full of love and His voice is very enduring.
Four things are difficult to get early: Beauty, Supreme
intellect, sweet voice and good character. Some are
beautiful but not intelligent. Some are intelligent but does
not have a good voice. Some does not have a good
character. In all these, there is a beauty of individual, Hans
are naturally very beautiful. Even Mahatmas suffix their
name with Hans. Let us move towards their story, their
characteristics cannot be observed even in humans. If the
male partner dies among the Hans, the female Hans will
not permit other male birds to even touch its body as long
as it lives. This nature cannot be observed even among the
Demi-Gods (Devas). The appearance of Hans is beautiful
and it is white in color. It has beautiful eyes with a red
lining. It is very lovely to see. Their habits are exceptional.
It eats Pearls and keeps away from dirt. It is peaceful and
confident. It does not behave irrationally.
Therefore, the Hansas on the sea were disturbed. The
show of ego by the sea provoked the ego of Hansas.
In friendship, there is a mutual reliance. Similar is the
case of Bhakti (Devotion). Parampurush is Fearful of Ego;
He is hidden because of your ego. He is the ocean of Love,
He expects only Love. However, man contemplates
seeking such a power with which he can subdue others. It
is in the Nature of Parampurush to sacrifice everything.
The one who has realised Parampurush with his Surti,
whatever he says will be manifested. With your weapon, if
someone kills your son what will be your reaction? You
will not wish such things to happen. Similarly,
Parampurush does not wish for such things to happen to
other with the power received from him, because when all
are his children who can be put to distress. Therefore,
when you attain purity, you will offer yourself.


The Real Disciple 15
A devotee did penance towards Brahma. Brahma being
pleased asked him as to what is his wish. The devotee
asked that whatever he will seek should be fulfilled.
Brahmaji could understand the Greed of the devotee and
the implications. He granted his wish saying that whatever
he seeks, his neighbors shall get twice that. The devotee
returned home and prayed, 'Oh God, bless me with a
Golden House'. His neighbor got two houses. Then he
prayed for a chariot of gold. His neighbor got two. The
devotee got furious and disturbed. He prayed for a
beautiful Cow, His Neighbor got two. Then he led a
peaceful Life. The neighbor's wife began to taunt the wife
of the devotee. Devotee got annoyed. He resolved to take
satisfaction in the suffering of his neighbor. He prayed, 'Oh
god take away one of my leg.' His neighbor lost both of his
legs. Then he prayed, 'Oh Lord, take away one of my hand
also.' He thought that he could carry on with one hand. His
neighbor lost both of his hands. He further prayed, 'Oh
God, take away one eye.' His neighbor lost both his eyes.
The sense of hatred is so dangerous. Than the devotee
prayed, 'Oh God, make a deep ditch in front of my house.'
His neighbor has got on both side of his house. This way,
he complicated his neighbor's house. For this very reason,
Parampurush is hidden from the sight. So it is said:
_Mita De Apni Hasti Ko, Agar Kuch Martahba Chahey|
Ki Dana Khaak Mey Mil Kar, Guley Gulzar Hota Hey||_
Therefore, give up the feeling of 'I'. If you give up the
'I'ness you will seek nothing. All desires develop due to
this very 'I'. When all the desires leave you, you become a
Mahatma.
_Chah Miti Chinta Miti, Maan Va Beparvah|
Vohi Shahanshah Hey, Jako Nahi Chah||_
When you give up all desires, you become an emperor.
It is not easy to give up desires. It is extraordinary. That is
why, such a person is exceptional.
The whole world is selfish. People take up devotion to
fulfill their desires. There is a selfish background behind


16 Sahib Bandgi
every shades of devotion. Devotees of Hanuman seek
strength but not Hanuman. A Devotee of Laxmi has no
reason for devotion other than seeking wealth. A devotee
of Ganesh has no relation with him. He seeks only success
of his effort (Karya Siddhi). Nobody wants a favorite deity.
Where is the Arjun today, who has surrendered all his
to Krishna? Before the Mahabharata War, both Arjun and
Duriyodhan approached Krishna for support. At that time,
Krishna was relaxing. First Duriyodhan entered and sat
closer to the head side of cot on which Krishna was
relaxing. When Arjun entered the room, he sat closer to the
feet of Krishna. When Krishna opened his eye, He saw
Arjun in front and enquired about his welfare and the
reason for his visit. Arjun explained the reason of his visit.
Then Duriyodhan also got up, moved towards front, and
said that he also has come for seeking the support. Krishna
said that he extends his support to both of them. However,
I will be on one side and my warriors and weapons will be
on one side. Further, I will not touch any weapon in the
Battlefield. He gave the choice to Arjun first. Duriyodhan
thought that Arjun would take entire army with him so he
pleaded with Krishna that having come first, he should be
given the first opportunity to choose. However, Krishna
said that it was Arjun, whom he saw first and it is Arjun's
turn to choose first. Duriyodhan was mentally worried that
Arjun will take the entire army. The world is also like this.
Everyone is competing in seeking things and remedies of
Mayaic world from the Satguru and the Lord. Sahibji says:
_Aaisi Duniya Bahey Diwani, Bhakti Bhav Nahi Buzey Ji|
Ko Aavey Toh Beta Mangey, Yahi Gosahi Dijey Ji|
Koi Aavey Hey Dukh Ka Maara, Hum Par Kripa Kijey Ji|
Koi Aavey Toh Daulat Mangey, Bhet Rupaya Lijey Ji|
Koi Karavey Vyah Sagai, Sunat Gusai Rizey Ji|
Sanche Ka Koi Grahak Nahi, Juthey Jagat Patijey Ji|
Kahahi Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Andho Ko Kya Kijey Ji||_
......Arjun with folded hands requested that he needs
only Krishna. Now the entire army has gone to


The Real Disciple 17
Duriyodhan's side. Duriyodhan left delighted but Arjun
stayed back with Krishna. Later, Vasudev Krishna asked
Arjun as to what a choice he has made. I gave you the
choice first, why did you choose me. I will not fight any
battle. Arjun said 'Oh Janardan, if a Lion roars in the
Jungle, even the Birds will fall from tree like dry leaves.
Sensing this, all the other animals also run to take shelter.
Even if you do not fight the battle, your mere presence will
deplete the strength of Kaurav army.' Hearing these words,
Krishna embraced Arjun with his arms.
We too like Arjun, should seek only Satguru. Only this
entitles us to be called a true disciple. All the other worldly
attachment should be given up. Sahibji says:
_Chinta Toh Guru Naam Ki, Aur Na Chitavey Dass|
Jo Kuch Chitavey Naam Bin, Soi Kaal Ki Phas||_
Thoughts other than the Naam and the involvement of
the worldly things are all of Kalpurush only.
A traveler was on his way from an Oasis. He became
tired on the way. It was a hard day. As he walked, he could
locate a tree. He took a deep breath and laid down under
the tree. He thought, if only he could get water he can
quench his thirst. As he contemplated, he saw a pond in
front of him.
Now whatever is Your thought, it can become a reality.
This power exists in Atma. If you concentrate on a point,
your wish can materialize. People fear Mahapurush
because of the existence of this power in them. They can
with their concentration on any point (Bindu) grant boon or
bane to anyone. Even if a sinner reaches in contemplation
on that point, he can succeed in that power but it is not
easy for an ordinary person. Therefore, he has quenched
his thirst. Then he again deeply concentrated on the point
and wished for food to appease his hunger. As he looked,
he saw a plate filled with food in front. He ate his stomach
filled. Even then, his desires did not subside. He thought
that if he can get mat, he could relax comfortably. Behold


18 Sahib Bandgi
even the mat appeared in front. He lay down on the mat
and the thought arouse in him that the Jungle is dangerous
one and if the Lion comes, it will eat me off. As he
contemplated, he saw a Lion coming from the Jungle. The
lion gave a blow and beheaded the man.
If you desire the worldly Maya (Illusion), in the end
you will regret. A true devotee will not have limitless
desire. Hence, they are free from worries. On the contrary,
Satguru have to take care of needs & requirements of such
Disciple. Parents take good care of their children.
Whatever the children asks they get it. However, even if
they do not ask they will get plenty. They get so much
love, which even those children who demand does not get.
The demanding children sometime they may not get things
of their choice however, for those children who does not
demand, their parents take care of their every needs. Their
parents worry about any shortage, which the children may
face.
_Paley Kharch Na Baandhatey, Jo Deveh So Kay|
Govind Taake Pachey Phirey, Mat Bhukey Rah Jay||_
Nevertheless, it is not true that those who ask his
Satguru do not get anything from him. Sahibji says:
_Guru Saman Daata Nahi, Yachak Shishya Saman|
Tin Lok Ki Sampada, So Guru Dini Daan||_
He can grants wealth of the three lokas but if he does
not ask or seek anything, Guru will make him like himself.
There existed a King. One day he has passed through
village. The elders of the village received him with respect.
The King spoke enduringly to them. A poor child mentally
wished that the King would speak to him with the same
love. He tried to move forward closer to the King, pleading
with the people to show the way for him. Whomever he
met, they teased him. One day he has approached Sant.
Looking at his innocent nature, the Sant told him the way
to reach the King.
Palace was under construction and the boy started
working in the project. However, when the wage was paid


The Real Disciple 19
to the workers the boy kept himself away. One day the
cashier caught him and enquired with him the reason for
his conduct. The boy said that it is the duty to serve his
King and it is not for making money. Cashier was surprised
to hear the boy and took him to the Minister. The minister
was intelligent enough to understand the honesty and
dedication of the boy; he thought he would be useful.
Therefore, he gave him a supervisor job. When the job was
complete, the King came to see. Minister has told about the
boy to the King. The Kings were also of the nature that
whenever they find such people, they wish to meet them.
Therefore, the King told the Minister that he wanted to see
the boy. When the boy was brought to the King, he
enquired the reason for not collecting the wage and what
was his wish. The boy replied to the King that whatever he
has desired, he got it on that day itself. When King spoke
to him, he has explained to him that happened. King was
extremely pleased with the boy so he made him as a
Minister. As the day passed, the King developed love for
him. Therefore, he built a palace and gave it to him telling
that half of his country will now onwards belong to him. In
the similar way, _'Guru Karley Aap Saman|'_
In truth, those devotees who keep seeking all from
Satguru all the time, Satguru slowly moves away from
such disciple. He has hunger for love and he seeks only
love from his disciples and in exchange, he wishes to
shower his love but worldly people seek only materials of
the illusionary world. Therefore, Sat guru keeps away from
such people and makes his residence in the heart of true
disciple. In whosoever heart Satguru resides, he is a real
emperor. Those, whose heart is full of desires, are in real
sense a beggar because there is no place for Satguru there.
_Ek Dil Lakho Tamana, Uss Pey Bhi Jyada Havas|
Phir Thikana Hey Kaha, Usko Bithane Key Liye||_
Therefore, give up all worldly desires and become an
emperor.


20 Sahib Bandgi
_Wohi Shanshah Hey, Jisko Nahi Chah||_
Therefore, Satguru will grant whatever He wished. If
you develop the habit of seeking, he may become
apprehensive of giving something wrong. Supreme lord is
hiding because of such people only. When the heart is full
of desires and mind is filled with vicious thoughts, how can
the Supreme lord manifest in front. Therefore
_Is Dil Ka Hujara Saph Kar, Jaana Ke Aaney Ke Liye|
Dhyaan Auro Ka Uttha, Usko Bithane Ke Liye||
Ek Dil Lakho Tamanna, Uss Pey Bhi Jyada Havas|
Phir Thikana Hey Kaha, Usko Bithane Key Liye||_
In the Aknoor Ashram (Jammu), a wicked proposal
came. A woman told, "I thought Sahibji will show his true
form". I replied "What! Haven't you seen"? The woman
had expected a violent reaction. We all think that the
spirituality is for the destruction of the world. Everyone
could comprehend the real nature of Sahibji. We had no
firearms with us however, the enemies (people who came
to burn the Sahib Bandgi ashram) perceived as if all Sahib
Bandgis are armed with guns. In confusion, they ran away
helter-skelter. We did not do anything. As per the woman,
we should have physically engaged with the enemies and
decimated them. The world understands that the one who
violently punishes the evil minded can only be supreme
lord. However, the one who reacts like that is actually a
Satanic Atma.
....Similarly, there was a dialog between the Hansas and
the sea. Therefore, the Hansas left the sea. They flew to a
mountain stream and stayed there. Some time passed, but
both felt mutual need.
Sometime, some say that women are nothing but
footwear. It is not true! She is an associate. Once, a man
came and said that he wished to give the land for Ashram. I
enquired whether he has taken permission from his mother.
He said "Yes Sahib". Then I asked him whether he has
taken the opinion of his wife also. He replied, "Where is
the need?" I directed him to consult his wife and it is not


The Real Disciple 21
proper. Wife has equal right; there is no greater friend than
wife. The women has feminity, people do not see that.
Men's visions are lustful. Women have love and are
submissive in nature; they do not display control but they
do want to control. Give them the control.
.....Therefore, the Hansas kept away from the sea. Both
of them kept remembering each other. They felt sad about
of each other. One day, some sages passed by the sea. One
of them commented, "Brothers, look at the sea". The other
replied, "No! It is not a sea, it looks like a pond". When the
sea heard them, it was surprised. By then, the sages came
close to the sea. They were talking among themselves.
They were unable to resolve that it is indeed a sea. For they
arrived at a conclusion that if it really a sea then Hansa bird
should have been there but, they cannot find any. The sea
was listening to them. It has understood that his identity is
with bird, Hansas. However, the one who declared as sea
said that it is too big to be a pond but others said that there
is not even a single Hansa in the sea. When they came
close, the sea said:

Sea: I am the sea.
Mahatma 1: No! You are not the sea. If it is so, where are
the Hansas?
Sea: With sadness, it said yes. Due to my ego, I have not
understood their importance. They remained with me
but now they left. Oh Sants! If you happen to see
Hansas anywhere, please pass on the message. I am
saddened because of their absence.
The Sants left the place, moved on, and reached a
lake. One of them said;
Mahatma 1: Look at the Hansas.
Mahatma 2: No, they are cranes.
Listening to this, the Hansas began to worry. The
Mahatmas began to discuss among themselves. The one
who called them as Hans said, "Look at their beauty, how


22 Sahib Bandgi
white they are!" Other Mahatma said, "No! They cannot be
Hansas. If it so they should have been in the sea and not
here". The Hansas became sad; "Yes, our identity is with
the sea". When the Mahatmas approached close, the
Hansas spoke to them:
Hans: We are Hansas.
Mahatmas: No! You cannot be Hansa. Hansa live on the
sea.
Hansas: We could not understand that. We were in the sea
but because of our ego, we left the sea and reached here.
Mahatmas: Hey Hansas! Go back to your own place. The
sea has sent a message with us. It is also in sadness because
of your absence.
Hansas left the lake and reached the sea. They were
happy together.
Similar is my relationship with you. Where is the
question of pride in this? I observe Sahib's presence in all
of you. Children have the essence of father and mother.
Similarly, at the time of Naamdan (initiation), Sahib and
Satguru, both became part of you. Earlier there was no
evidence of Sahib in you but now he is manifest in you
because-
_Naam Paye Satya Jo Beera, Sang Rahu Mey Daas Kabira|
Guru Samana Shishya Mey, Shishya Liya Kar Neh|
Bilgaye Bilgye Nahi, Ek Rup Do Deh||_
If I have any wealth, it is only you. That is why I am
always on the lookout for your service. I have not become
a Swami. Our connection is deeper. It is unbreakable. All
you need is a grace of Satguru. Never think that you are
doing great service. Do not let your thoughts gamble with
you with pride. Express your weakness instead so that
Guru out of compassion will remove the defects.
_'Dwaar Daya Ka Jab Tu Khole|
Pancham Swar Mey Gunga Bole||'
'Adakar Khud Khajane Se|
Chudha Le Apney Bande Ko||'_
You have to have such mentality. Dharmadasji says


The Real Disciple 23
_Mey Apradhi Janam Ka, Nakh Shikh Bhara Vikar|
Chahey Banda Baksh Do, Chahey Gardan Maar||
Mey Kami Mey Kutlu, Mey Avgun Ki Khaan|
Moh Par Krupa Na Chadiye, Daas Apno Jaan||_
Even elderly persons suppress their behavior. They
present themselves as very simple and weak and expect
grace of Guru. Do not display at your character. In front of
Satguru, you should seek to remove your flaws. Satguru
will reprimand you on your failures. That attitude which
even your intelligent will not accept will draw the attention
of Satguru for his action. You should not manipulate but
accept his words.
_Guru Khumhar Shishya Kumbh Hey|
Gadhi Gadhi Kadhey Khot|
Antar Haat Sahar De, Bahar Bahe Chot||_
Those Gurus who indulge in comfort and pleasures of
the world will not be in the position to guide their
disciples. They have fear of losing their desciples. They
cannot bear the losses in their business. If the devotee is
free from sinful deeds, how can he give more money?
Satguru is like a potter. Just as a potter with his one
hand to support from inside the pot and with the other
beating, gives shape to the pot; Satguru also to remove the
flaws in the disciple, externally he scolds and internally he
supports by pouring love so that he will not have a
heartbreak.
First Guru hits at the ego of his disciple. The hatred will
be transformed into detachment. The more you are
honored, the more you will get involved in Maya (illusion).
That is why; a disciple should not aspire to be more
respectable in society. As long as there is a pride, there is a
chance of pitfall and loss. Sahibji says-
_Shish Utarey Bhui Darey, Tapar Rakhe Pav|
Kahe Kabir Dharmadas Se, Aisa Hoi Tey Aav||_
Save yourself from pride. The more pride you have,
more harm it will incur (Higher you go, harder you fall). A
boxer is expected to bravely receive the heavy blows. If


24 Sahib Bandgi
not, he will fall like a big heap with a blow. In the same
way, you should have forbearance. Remember, I have not
returned your mind.
_Maan Hi Diya Nij Sab Diya, Maan Ke Sang Sharir|
Sab Devey Ko Kya Raha, Jyo Kathi Kahahi Kabir||_
World exist due to mind, all relationships are due to
mind. It is due to mind alone, soul is in attachment.
Therefore, I have not returned your mind. If Satguru takes
your mind then what is that mind you have; so never accept
appreciation from your Guru. All the time, seek your Guru
to identify your faults so that you may correct them.
However, if you seek praise, it means you have not
truthfully surrendered your mind from your heart. Then
understand that I have also not bestowed you the "Naam".
It is like a traveler missing his donkey. He went in search
of it and reached a village. It became dark. He thought of
spending the night there. There was an elderly couple. He
knocked the door. In those days, it was an honor to receive
any guest. They received him with honor. They were poor.
At that time, they had a little vegetable and milk. They
thought of giving him one, and keep the one for
themselves. They asked the traveler as to what he would
prepare. He was a crooked man. He told them, after eating
the vegetable, he would drink the milk. The situation
became unmanageable. The couples started discussing
among themselves and ended up quarreling. Traveler
observed the situation and walked away. As he walked
away, the old man told his wife, he did not fight with her in
true sense. In the meanwhile, the traveler also returned. He
was listening to them hiding. He told them that he has also
did not leave in truth.
If you have not surrendered your Individuality,
Possessions and Mind to me, understand that I have also
not given you the Naam in truth. If you have truthfully
surrendered your mind to me, know that it is with me. This
is not an ordinary statement. The truth is, Mind is with me


The Real Disciple 25
since that time. Therefore, you are unable to indulge in
vicious acts. Earlier the Mind made you to wander but now
it is not so. Just as a cattle bound on a pole with a rope of
20 - 25 meters long, when it tries to run away, the rope will
restrain the cattle within that length, not more. In the same
way, your Mind has come under control. It can do only that
much, the rope permits. Earlier, you used to commit
mistakes freely but now you are warned. The power of the
soul (adhyatmic) restrains you. You have become pure.
_Pehele Yaha Maan Kaag Tha, Karta Jivan Ghaat|
Ab Toh Maan Hansa Bhaya, Mothi Chuni Chuni Khat||_
This mind is full of perverted tendencies(vices) so
never make self-praise of your good qualities, in front of
Satguru. Satguru is compassionate. So do not hesitate to
place your weaknesses in front of them so that, he can
remove them. Always remain in humility in the association
of Sants. There is no benefit in approaching them with ego.
Therefore, Sahibji says---
_Kahe Kabir Taji Bharam Ko, Nanha Hey Kar Piv|
Taji Aham Guru Charan Gahu, Jum So Bache Jiv||_
Stay in humility. If the sugar candy is mixed with sand,
elephant cannot eat it whereas an ant can eat it easily. The
essence of truth of Parampurush is so subtle that a hugely
egoistic minded person cannot comprehend it.
_Misri Bikhri Ret Mey, Hasti Chuni Na Jaye|
Kida Ho Kari Jab Chuney, Tab Sahib Ko Paye||_
Therefore, Satguru hits at the ego very hard first then
slowly slowly, he removes all the vices. If he cannot
accomplish this, he is not a well-wisher or benefactor.
Disciple should always implement the words of the
Satguru and should not develop doubt on his words by
discrimination. Not only this, there is a hidden secret in
every word of Satguru ('Mantra moolam, Guru Vakyam|').
The welfare of the devotee lies in promptly following
words of Satguru.
A paigambar asked the God whether there is any great
devotee other than himself on this earth. He said, he is


26 Sahib Bandgi
always in remembrance of God. He has asked whether
there is anyone dearer than he is. God replied, "Till now
you have not attained deservedness to be in my proximity
and with love. Come let me show you. He directed him to a
village and to stay with a particular Mahatma there. He will
not allow you to stay with him but tell him about my word.
Paigambar said ok and reached the Mahatma. Mahatma
told him that he could not keep him. Paigambar told him
that Khuda has sent him. He said it's all right, but under a
condition that you should not obstruct my work. I can
forgive you thrice but not more". Paigambar has accepted
the condition. Mahatma went on his work. He also
accompanied him. On the way, on a vacant plot, Mahatma
said that they should make a house because there are no
houses. Both of them were engaged from morning until
evening. He got tired and said, "If this work belonged to a
householder, they would have got atleast food. What is the
purpose of this?" Mahatma told him that this is your first
time. They moved on. On the way, they found the children
playing. Mahatma enquired some as to whose children they
are. The person told him that the children are of King.
Mahatma asked as whose child it is. Person replied that he
belongs to the rich man. Pointing to other child, the person
said that it is poor man's child. Mahatma took stick and
started beating that child; he has beaten him very much.
Paigambar could not restrain; he told the Mahatma that if
you want to beat, you could have beaten rich man's child,
why the poor man's?" Mahatma replied, this was your
second chance. They moved on further and came across
boat. Mahatma enquired as to whose boat it was. A man
told that it belonged to a businessperson and he pointed to
other boat, which belonged to a poor man's. He said he is
taking care of his family with the earning from the boat.
Mahatma took a rod and started damaging all the boats. He
damaged it. Paigambar thought that Mahatma is very cruel.
He has asked mahatma the reason for his action and said,


The Real Disciple 27
"If you wanted to damage, you could have damaged rich
man's boat". Mahatma replied, "Now this was your third
chance, you may go away". Paigambar said, "Yes I will go
but please tell me, why did you do all these"? Mahatma
said, "I built a house on a desolate place for the
convenience of a dearest devotee of a lord will be passing
through that place".
_Jaise aaye khasam ki vani, taise bajau suno re lalo||_
"I beat the poor child who is also the child of dearest
devotee of the lord. The child had vices. I have beaten only
to remove the vices. I have damaged the boat because some
robbers were to arrive shortly to carry the stolen item with
these boats. The order came from the lord that one of the
boats belongs to his dearest devotee. The thieves were to
use the boats. I have damaged the boat only for preventing
this from happening; the boat could be repaired by the
devotee later". Paigambar fell at the feet of Mahatma to
accept him. Mahatma replied that he could not keep him
again.
This narration shows that at first, Mahatma's words
sounds very strange but they have their value. They do not
do like mad persons. There are situations under which the
word of the Sants appears wrong and we think our position
is correct. No, it is not so, never take that position. When
you make use of your mind, it will bind you with the
world. Therefore, submit with humility before a Satguru;
do not use your cleverness.
_Naam Satya Guru Satya Ho, Aap Satya Jo Hoy|
Tin Satya Jab Ek Ho, Vish Sey Amrut Hoy||_
What is your satya, the third one? It means carry on
with whatever Satguru says. Do not be on your own
especially your Mind. Whatever Satguru says, do that.
_Khak Ho Guru Key Charan Mey, Toh Tujhey Manjil Miley||_
Do not simply accept that which comes as your
thought.
_Mujhey Hai Kam Satguru Se, Duniya Ruthe Toh Ruthan De||_


28 Sahib Bandgi
There could be a situation where whole world will say
is all right but if Guru says it is not correct. Then you
should accept only that which Satguru says. Maha
Purushas will not follow the world. They move away from
the world. They are beyond the Mind and Maya therefore
accept what they say. Now the horse is under your control.
The people will say, visit such and such Devi's temple
but you need not. You may think that they will become
angry with you; do not worry.
_Shish kat nij kar mey lijiye| Brahm ke sukh ko tab chitt bhijey||_
If you want to experience the bliss of the supreme lord,
you can keep away from your mentality. With a short story
of a worm and a moth, sahibji says-
_Kitt Patang Se Puchhe Baata|
Deepak Girey Koun Sukh Bhrata||
Tehi Patang Aas Vachan Sunavey|
Tumhi Deep Dhig Chali Sukh Pavey||_
Sahibji says the worm asks the moth," What pleasure
do you drive falling into a lamp of light"? Moth told worm,
"You also move closer to the light and enjoy that pleasure".
_Kitt Tabhahi Deepak Niyaraya|Puni Patang Dhig So Chali Aaya||
Aay Patang Bola Chillai|Mey Kachu Jyoti Swad Na Pai||_
Worm went near the lamp, came back to the Moth, and
said it did not find any pleasure in the lamp. Moth told:
_Aahey Mudh Sansari Kidda|
Tehi Na Vyapey Taan Maan Pidda||
Sukh Patang Aasik So Jaana|
Deepak Mey Jyo Dhay Samana||
Tu Toh Phira Dekhi Ke Aagi|
Janey Kaha Mudh Durbhagi||_
Moth said, "Oh ignorant worldly moth, the disease of
Individuality and Mind has not left you. Only those moths,
which are full of love, can only appreciate the light. You
have come here looking at the fire. You are unfortunate,
what you can realize?"
Sahib says-
_Shish Kaati Nij Kar Mey Lije|_


The Real Disciple 29
_Brahm Key Sukh Mey Tab Chit Bhijey||_
In the same way, cut off and hold the head (Mind) in
your hand. Only then, you can realize the bliss of
Parampurush. It means, you have to give up my and mine.
You should give up the feeling of life and death because, to
reach there, you should become a living dead- jeevan
mukta. Sahib again says-
_Shish Utarey Bhui Dharey, Tapar Rakhe Paav|
Kahe Kabir Dharmadas Se, Aisa Hoy Toh Aav||_
Only then, you can experience that bliss. Until the time
you realize the Parampurush, nothing is profitable. The
world has the mentality, that of the herd. They are satisfied
if their Gurus read out the way to reach Paramatma from
the book. Nothing can be accomplished with this; neither
Atma attains any benefit nor can bliss of realization of
Parampurush be obtained.
_Bheda Chal Sakal Sansara|
Nar Pamar Ko Yaha Vyavhara||
Sab Koi Kah Yaha Mero Dharma|
Mero Guru Kahayo Yaha Karma||
Sabtey Humro Dharm Badara|
So Budhvant Jo Karey Vichara||
Chaley Aandh Ke Pichhe Aandha|
Bina Vichar Karey Soi Dhandha||_
Sahib says, "World has herd mentality". Everyone
claims that his or her religion and their religious head or
Guru is only supreme. No one enquires whether they
attained the bliss of supreme lord. Will their guru help
them to reach upto the supreme lord? If he reads out from
the scriptures, then he won't be of any help". That is why,
Gurus have to be examined. Sahibji says-
_Shisya sayaan guru agyani| dhokhe hoy dono ko haani||
Navka upar bahu jiv chadhavey| kheva bina paar nahi pavey||
Khevanhar chinhi jab lehi| paachhe pav nauka par dehi||
Kevanhar chinhi na paavey| nauka chadhey so murkh kahavey||_
Sahibji says, "Till one examines and convinced about
the boatman, they should not board on boat. Those who


30 Sahib Bandgi
take the board without making an assessment are
considered foolish. He has to check whether he will reach
the other end or not; because until one reaches the supreme
lord, that bliss cannot be experienced. Sahib explains
_Jaise Naari Purush Var Hoyi|
Ek Dusro Janey Soi||
Janey Tey Kachhu Sukh Nahi Sarsey|
Naari Purush Jablo Nahi Parsey||
Arash Parash Tey Sukh Sarsana|
Tab Maan Hi Maan Mey Sukh Samana||

Sakhi Ki Soun Sakhi Koi Bujhey|
Piya Milan Ko Sukh Jehi Sujhey||
Aur Koi Jo Puchhey Jahi|
Chup Hey Rahe Tabey Muskai||
Brahm Ko Sukh Jo Koi Kahahi|
Gunga Hoy Na So Kachu Kahai||
Jal Mey Paitath Jal Hey Jahi|
Taki Khabar Kahey Ko Aai||_
Sahibji says just like on marriage, a man and women
come to know each other. However, until the time they get
a touch feeling; they cannot experience the pleasure in their
Mind. That pleasure, the women she can only narrate to her
friend; if anyone else asks, she observes silence. She gives
only a smile. In the same way, when one gets the bliss of
Paramatma, it can be only be expressed like a dumb. It is
like diving into water to become water itself.
Until you immerse yourself in devotion, you cannot
experience its pleasure. Till the time you have the fear of
death, you will not be able to immerse into Bhakti. That is
why you should be free from this fear. You have to reach
there by living dead therefore, you have to give up the fear
of death. You have to forget 'me and mine' in this process.
_Shish Utarey Bhui Dharey, Tapar Rakho Paav|
Kahe Kabir Dharmadas Se, Aiso Hoy To Aav||_


The Real Disciple 31
In this human birth, you have the opportunity to serve.
This service should be offered to Satguru. The body has to
be squeezed in the service because-
_Aakhir Yaha Taan Khakh Milega..._
Therefore, you have to engage in service. Whatever all
the activities or Karmas they are of no benefit. Whether
you toil in the field or do hard labor day and night, it will
not come to your help. However, whatever services you
render to your Satguru, only will come to your rescue.
If the disciples do not render any service to his Guru, it
is a crime that is why service is important.
_Nanak Jo Guru Sevey Apna, Ho Tisey Balihari Jau||_
Service to Guru is supreme. Sahibji says-
_Guru sevey katey dukh paapa| janam janam ko mitey santapa||
Guru ki seva sada chitt dijey| jivan janam suphal kari lijey||
Chaubis rup hari aapuhi dhariya| guru seva kari sabhi biriya||
Shiv viranchi guru seva kinha|| narad diksha dhruv ko dinha||
Sakal muni guru seva chahi| guru seva kari panth aavgahi||
Guru ki seva mukti nij pavey| bahuri na hansa bhavjal aavey||_
Guru sevas has a merit. Even celebrated Rishis and
Munis have rendered service to their Gurus. Hari took
incarnation and offered his Mind in service to his Satguru.
One, who spent human life without satguru, is an
unfortunate person. On the other hand, one who has a
Guru,but did not serve Him is a very foolish man.
_Yog Daan Jab Tirth Nahana| Guru Seva Binu Nishphal Jana||

Without serving a Guru, observance of Yoga, Jappa,
meditation, pilgrimage and penance becomes useless. If the
service to the Guru is not rendered, he will have


32 Sahib Bandgi
difficulties. Without service to Guru, wisdom cannot shine.
With the service to the Guru, heart blossoms with light.
The one who does not have Guru Seva, he cannot
experience love of a Guru.
Disciple should not develop ego-rendering service to
his Satguru. If there is ego involved then the service
become useless. You have to always stay close to your
Guru for his continued grace.

The guru is pleased with the good conduct of his
disciple. When Guru is pleased, and then says whatever
you would like to tell.
The Guru Seva entitles sanctity. No other seva can
match it. Sahib says
_Naamvant Bahute Miley, Gyaanvant Anek|
Kahe Kabir Dharmadas Se, Guruvantha Koi Ek||_
In Guru Seva, you will get all the rewards and entitles
you to all comforts. Sahib says
_Ganga Yamuna Badrish Sametey|Jagannathadi Dham Hai Tete||
Seve Phal Prapt Hoi Na Teto|Guruseva Mey Pavey Phal Teto||_
He says that you cannot attain that fruit with the
pilgrimage to Ganga, Yamuna, Badrinaath, Jagannath and


The Real Disciple 33
other holy places but you can attain the same with service
to Guru. Sahajobai says on this:
_Koti Tirth Bhram Bhram Aavey| So Phal Guru Ke Charanan
Pave||_
Come let me show you what **Satguru Bhakti** is.
Now you should not waste your time anywhere else but
spend the time with Satguru. Otherwise, devotion will
become defective. Do what Satguru says. That he forbids
never even attempt. All that which is forbidden, avoidable
and that which makes you Maanmukh (Mind centric) all
this should be given up.
If you are told not to go to Tantric, never go. Whatever
happens Disciple should not go anywhere else other than to
his Satguru for seeking help. I have forbidden, come what
may, never ever go to any Tantric. Evil spirits can never
affect you. Tantric will only confuse you. I asked the
Tantric about their work. A Tantrik in Akhnoor had his
influence up to Rajhoori and Punj (J.K). Earlier he was
opposing me, but now he has become a disciple. I enquired
with him as to what he was doing. How do you call the
spirit of Death? He requested not to ask about that. I told
him; I would like to know. He continued and said that they
have a group. They work together, and we were four in
numbers. We used to share the earning in percentage. 20
percent for one, 30 percent for one, 40 percent for one like
that. First, we observe, whether the couples are okay, then
one of us will climb up the tree and throw stone on the
house. With strange noise, we call out the head of the
house. When he comes out, he cannot make out anything in
the dark. His attention misses the tree so; he goes back
inside the house. However, this incident develops a fear in
him. Now it becomes the duty of the second person to
break into the Cow Shed and drink away the milk. In the
morning, when the woman of the house goes for milking
the Cow, the Cow will give a kick. With this, they became
more apprehensive. Then the third person under some


34 Sahib Bandgi
pretext to know whereabouts of some person, approach the
house then he will ask for the glass of water. Looking
around, he will command that there is something wrong in
the house. Lady responds saying that she also feels so then
the man begun to give a hint about the Tantrik and his
whereabouts. He gives the address of the Tantric anywhere
and commands that he has heard that the Tantrik is the
reliable person. In the evening, when the husband returns
home, the Lady tells that she feel something wrong in the
house. Man asked what to do then she gives the address of
the Tantrik. The man goes. I am the fourth person in the
Tantrik, I was accepting it. I tell him that I do not have
time to come to his house. He pleads with me saying that
the situation in the home is very bad. If not attended, it
may even cause a death in the house. Then I go with him
to his house and sound my Drum. If the mother of the
house is alive then ,I would say spirit of grandmother is
haunting you.Then I tell them it is very critical and requires
remedial solutions, further warning them that it will cause
them lot of money. The householder would plead that he
cannot spend so much money then I will offer some
concession. Then I note down in my diary the day and time
then I sound the drum and or give a talisman to them and
tell them that for the next 3-4 months nothing will happen
to them. They become satisfied. They become happy
noticing that nothing odd is happening and everything is
good. After 3 months, the same things are repeated again.
Then I tell, that we will not leave lifelong once we catch
those family. Sometimes we are beaten if we caught. Once
we had gone to drive away a dead spirit; one among us got
less money. He got angry and revealed everything to the
concerned house. Next time when we reached that place,
villagers gave a threshing, we ran over from there.
Times are changing. Shastri have appeared; they
trouble with useless rituals. Tantriks have taken the role of
Shastris (Priests). They have changed their role; why?


The Real Disciple 35
Because people get convienced by Shastri. When I started
coming here, that time rituals of jagrate(whole night
awakening by group of people singing of songs to please
GOD) was the practice. People began to understand, so
they reverted as Tantriks. Now the same Tantriks are
becoming priests again.Anyone who makes a living on
this, can not earn by other means. A man-eater lion will not
relish the flesh of any other animal, because human flesh is
tasty. Similarly, the Tantriks after making easy money
cannot take to hard labor for existence. The same group of
Tantriks became priests who perform Puja and Yagya. In
addition, they also continued to be Tantriks.
The Naam, which you received, will keep away all the
influence of evil spirits if any. It also takes control of the
fourteen internal Yamas (Lord of Deaths). What can an
external evil spirit can do?
_Adbhut Naam Sada Rakhwala||_
People do not follow this. If the grandchildren are not
born within two years of marriage, they take their
daughter-in-law to Tantric. There was an incident, a
woman while cutting the vegetable, hurt her finger so she
approached a Tantrik. She told that the neighbors have
done something wrong to her. Oh Lady! Go to the doctor
and stop the bleeding.
One lady told me that her buffalo is sick and she
thought that because of some ghost, it is sick. I asked her
“Have you taken a Naam?” She said “Yes”,then I said
“Then why are you in doubt?” She replied “One Shastri
said Naam is taken by you only, not by your buffalo.Your
buffalo is haunted by some ghost. Your Naam will not
protect that buffalo.”I said, “Shastri is will to say like that
only.”In another incident, son of one lady was sick,
neighbor started saying that it is because of devil spirit.I
asked “Have you taken a Naam?”She said “Yes, but my
son has not taken a Naam, and people are saying that Naam
taking by me will not help my haunted son, take him to


36 Sahib Bandgi
Shastri.” Worldly people do not want that you follow pure
stream of bhakti, so they are commenting like that. When I
observed people are engaged in such things, I decided to
address this issue first, bhakti in detail can be explained
later. I give confidence to them that if you have taken a
Naam then, any of your family member can not be troubled
by devil spirit .Sahib will protect your whole family. Sahib
says---
_Bhut Pishach Hoy Sab Niyaara| Adbhut Naam Sada Rakhvara||_
A person asked me that if I do not accept the problems
of evil spirits then what will happen to the spirits of their
Ancestors who are struggling in various worlds. What will
happen to them? They demand and if we do not provide
them, where will they go? I told him," There is a solution
for them also".
_Taru Taas Ik Hataar Bansha||_
Seventy-one generations of Ancestors will receive the
benefit of your Naamdaan and attain release from their
condition. As the power of Naam appears, they receive
merits.
...therefore, "Naam" gives complete protection. Sahib
says-
_Satguru Shabda Sahayi||
Nikat Gaye Tan Rog Na Vyaape, Paap Taap Mit Jayi||
Jadu Yantra Jugkti Na Lage, Shabda K Baan Dahayi||
Ojha Dayan Oor Dar Darpe| Jahar Jus Ho Jayi||
Kahe Kabir Katu Yam Phasa| Sukrut Laakh Duhayi||_
After the Naamdaan, you receive a strong protection.
Those who come first time to me, they do not approach me
with their eye of wisdom. They had some influence of evil
spirits. As they got remedy, I started imparting them
spiritual wisdom. They slowly began to understand the
existence of power of soul. I started reading out Ruhaniyat
(power of soul)to them. I have not changed anybody's
religion; we are not against any religion. All we say is that,
pray to that supreme lord contains complete worship of the
entire universe. We do say that Evil spirit does interfere in


The Real Disciple 37
life. However, after Naamdaan, they cannot interfere or
cause any harm. We do not deny the existence of ancestral
spirits. They do appear and present their desires but they all
come under these three worlds. However, we say, there
exist a fourth world. It is the country of pure spirits.
For the people who are affected by Evil spirits, even the
understandings of the three worlds are very difficult. Even
observing the internal worlds is a farsighted for them. If
spirits possesses somebody, they all say that Baba Surgal
has come. All the neighborhood people. come to pay their
obeisance. They say that Baba Surgal will bless them. The
benefit will only go to the Tantriks who will fool you
&empty your pocket.
I saw a girl; she said she gets Devi Mata. I made her sit.
She started rotating her head. I directed that she be beheld
tight but she was becoming smarter. As much as 90 percent
of them are crooked. She moved backward very fast with a
shiver. When I go to depth of such thing, I witness more
drama. As she moved backward, she was glancing at her
back to make sure that nothing is enduring her. Least she
will fell down on something so, she fall forward in style.
One way is to fall intentionally. Those who accidentally
fall, they even get head injury. I warned her not to fall
again; no evil spirit can come here in reality. No evil spirit
can enter the Ashram.Previously when I did satsang, 4- 6
womens get influenced by evil spirit thereonly. They do
three types of action.First they shouts loudly,then they
frightened you by their face & lastly started rotating their
head.First I thought it may be a new type of desease
overhere.So I tolerate first. Then I decided not to allow
such activities.Then I prepared 2-3 girls who were
physically strong & asked them to hold hairs of influenced
womens very tightly.Thenafter no women is doing such
drama.
So we say, when you receive the power of Naam, you
will not only be free from evil spirits, in addition the


38 Sahib Bandgi
ancestral also will get released and attain benefit. Neither
we have any conflict with Shivji nor do we fight with
Hanumanji. Neither are we Kamsa to wage a war with
Krishna nor Ravan to fight with Rama. I am not even
Bhairao to fight with Mataji. These are the narrations of the
world.
A woman had belief in me, but she has not taken
Diksha from me. All her family member have taken Naam
Daan from me. Just as men are alert, the women are also
alert. Just as some men are troublesome so do some
women. Just as some men are Quarrelsome, women are
also quarrelsome. I consider them as equal. The woman
said that she observed that in her family all the work
performed succesfully, in the end some obstacles comes
and spoils everything. Even my elders have faced the same
thing, which I observed happening to me also. Even to my
father and his father. When the work comes to final stage,
it gets spoiled. She enquired with me, reason for the same.
When I contemplated, I apprehended an individual. Just
like in olden days, when something falls into the well, they
let a tray tied to a rope into the well and move around. As
they move, the item will be stuck. Like that, I too
apprehended the person who was formless. I pulled him
out. I asked him, 'was it you?' He said, ' Yes!' I asked him
'what did you do?' He told that in the end, he disturbed
them mentally and destroys their work. My work was so
subtle that they could not notice.
That women said we are not in the mood of quarrel but
then also it happens. I asked that individual why he is
spoiling their work? Why are you making loss of them?.He
replied since last 400 years I am troubling this family. I
belongs to prêt yoni.
These spirits interferes with us in three ways. First, it
can appear before us and the second one enters into the
Mind. The third one forcefully enters the dream state. If
spirit entered in mind, you can feel that someone is


The Real Disciple 39
interfering. The spirit told me that in the formless state, I
am engaged in the work of destroying them. I asked him
for the reason to do so. He said that their Ancestors
murdered him because my lineage was destroyed.
In the olden days, men did not like to wish to end their
lineage. Assume that Mr. Mohanlal has two sons. Even if
one of the sons begets his son then his lineage will
continue. If their sons do not have children, there is no
continuation of their lineage. Therefore, he wanted to
continue his lineage. In the annual offering of food
(shraadh) to dead ancestral spirits, one by one (father,
mother, grandfather, etc.) in the final phase, they offer up
to sixteen. This includes those who are unknown. The
offerings (tarpan- a practice among Hindus) are made. Just
like while giving the invitation we accidently come across
an acquaintance and extend the invitation for them. Same
happens in this case.
He said that he does not receive Tarpan. I like to finish
the entire clan and I am capable of doing that but now there
is a hindrance. From the time they become devoted to you,
I am unable to succeed.
I told the woman that those who become my disciples,
they will be unaffected by the evil spirits.
The truth is, after the Naamdaan, I have provided you
with complete security. Even though there are elements
misguiding people, the number of disciples keeps on
growing. Our panth is expanding. This is the evidence of
power of Naam and the disciples are realizing the support
of the inner power.
He said, "Now I face hindrance". I was almost
completing my job. Many of them died. Now, I cannot
accomplish. I am unable to touch your devotees among
them.
You will experience protection on receiving Naamdaan.
It works like a protective shield. You can feel the power


40 Sahib Bandgi
supporting you. Demons and Evil spirits cannot come near
you.
There is a basis behind your faith. You seek protection.
Just as the sense of safety, you feel on wearing a
bulletproof vest. The bullet cannot harm you. Similarly,
evil effects of the planets and power of Tantras cannot
affect you. You have become strong. Looking at this,
others think that you have changed your religion. We show
the path of righteousness. We tread on the path of truth and
non-violence. We follow righteous conduct and we have
given up the illusionary practices. We are not affected and
at the same time, we do not give importance to the
influence of planets and evil practices. These things happen
very rarely but some hypocrites exploit with the intention
of making money on this pretext. If the buffalo becomes
sick, they refer this to evil effects. Even though the woman
has taken Naamdaan, people will tell that the buffalo is not
free. It means, they try to befool you. I do not ask people
for money or direct them to spend money. If anybody
comes with the depression, I comfort them and tell them
that they are well protected from evil effects especially
after the Namdaan. We do not free people from the religion
but from their Illusion (Maya) but the hypocrites try to
hoodwink them. Sahibji says:
_Yeh Kewal Bhrama Key Utpati||_
Hypocrites' extract money on such activities. This
group is very dangerous. They do it simply for earning
money.
From the time you have taken Naamdaan, these things
cannot harm you. You would have noticed this on many
occasions.
He was after that family for 400 years. Said, I cannot
reconcile now. I am not able to go near those who have
your Naam. While I was dying, I resolved to take revenge
on the family. That is why, I want to finish this family and
their lineage. My condition is not changed.


The Real Disciple 41
Therefore, what the woman said was correct. Atma is in
everyone, it helps in understanding the truth. It is the game
of Surti. This is what mind plays, game with the
concentration (Surti) and misdirects. However after
Naamdaan this cannot continue.
_Naam Hoi Toh Math Namavey||_
It is only Naam, which can give complete security. As
if I forbid Tantriks, I ask Naamis not to go to Astrologists.
Neither for the birth nor for the marriage time or for any
other reason do not go to astrologers for consultancy.
There is no need for you. The Naam has nullified the
effects of the planets. You are free from the evil influence
of Planets because-
_Nav Graha Ka Bas Nahi Chalayi|Sabhi Vighna Sada Tal Jai||_
After the Naamdaan, the Navgrahas cannot affect you. I
say that you should ignore this. Even otherwise, 99 percent
it is hoodwink. In the year 2005 election in India, Vajpayee
was the prime minister of India, he was to be re-elected.
Nearly 200 astrologers predicted that Vajpayee will
become prime minister again and said that there are no
harmful effects of the planet. I have the news cutting with
me. However, Bhartiya Janta Party lost election and
Manmohan Singh became prime minister of India. Not
even one has written that Manmohan Singh will become
the prime minister. My question is, is it not a kind of
fraud? They were all learned and famous astrologers. If
this is their status then, what about those astrologers sitting
on the streets? Their work is to create fear intentionally and
extract money in the name of remedial measures, etc. Our
principle of observance of righteous conduct, are damaging
their cause. We have nothing to take from Shani Maharaj
(Saturn). We ask you to be single-mindedly (concentrated)
devoted.
Where is the necessity of making pilgrimage to various
holy places? When you accept Satguru himself as
Parampurush then visiting his ashram becomes a


42 Sahib Bandgi
pilgrimage. Why is it so? Visiting such places is not bad; it
only constitutes Sagun Bhakti whereas we are raising you
to the level of Para Bhakti and beyond. Before marriage, a
girl can play with toys. Is it to be continued even after the
marriage? Temples etc; build to create a seed of devotion
in you. All these are okay until the time you find a Real
Satguru,thenafter you should not get involved in such kind
of act.. After that, you have to move forward with Satguru
Bhakti. Devotion to Satguru constitutes devotion to entire
universe (Brahmand).
_Devi Deval Jagat Mey, Kotin Puje Koi|
Satguru Ki Pooja Kiye, Sabki Pooja Hoi||_
Further, it is said-
_Kotin Teerat Bhram Bhram Aavey|
So Phal Guru Ke Charanan Pavey||_
Such activity will spoil your devotion. However, due to
the pressure from the family members if you happen to go
on such trip, go with the remembrance (Smaran) of Naam
of Satguru. Nevertheless, even forgetfully, do not drop
coins or bow your head (as a disciple of Satguru, your level
of Bhakti is higher than Sargun and Nirgun Bhakti).
Similarly, you do not have to give donations or
subscriptions to such places. Other than, at the Holy feet of
Satguru, you should not offer or donate anything (Puja
Mulam Guru Padakam||). It is because of the reason, that
there is every chance of misusing your donation, or used
for wrong purpose,you are also responsible for that, escape
from this. I take that Subscription and begging are the
same. Do not continue, keep away from this.
Do not take leftover food of others because your
position (Satya Bhakti) is that of Mahatma, Hans. They do
not take food from a dirty spot. People without true Naam
of a Satguru cannot be free from vices.
_Unch Wahi Jo Naam hey Jana|
Bina Naam Sab Nich Bakhana||_
If you take the leftovers of the others, you will be
afflicted by their traits (mentality-Gunn). Therefore, be


The Real Disciple 43
cautious. Do not take food from the house of non-
vegetarian family. Avoid even taking water. The effect of
the non-vegetarian food cannot be removed from the
vessels even after cleaning them, even if it is used once.
Do not take Prasad (am) from anyone or anywhere
because once the food is offered to anyone, the leftovers
food is considered contaminated (And not suited to Hansa).
You should partake the Prasad, which is offered in the
Ashram of your Satguru only. You should also take the
liquid Prasad offered there.
Give up the worry on the welfare of your dead
ancestors. After your initiation, even your dead ancestors
attain merits and welfare. Therefore, give up the worry.
Annual Performance of offerings to dead ancestral spirits
(Shraadh) is not a wrong practice. One year of our world is
equal to one day of the ancestral world (Pittru Lok). All
that offerings which you make with faith and belief
actually reaches them. However, 71 generations of
ancestral spirits of a Naami receives the merits and are
released from ancestral world. Therefore, you need not
have to offer anything to your ancestors (your act of taking
Naam from Satguru relieves you from the burden).
Therefore, you need not to show any devotion or pray for
your ancestors. Vasudev Krishna also asked Arjun that he
need not pray to Spirits, Ancestors and Demi-Gods (Devas-
Angels) and directed him to keep the concentration (Surti)
on Krishna only because Krishna was Guru for Arjun at
that time. It means that you do not have to worry about
your ancestors whether they reach the world of spirit or
ancestor world (Pitru lok) or heavens (Swarg lok), If you
are devoted to your Guru. Further, those ancestors who
have taken Naamdaan from a real Satguru have reached
Satlok where hunger and thirst does not exist. Therefore,
do not take the trouble in sending food etc; for them. Even
otherwise, this will constitute devotion to ancestors but you
have to keep your concentration only on Satguru.


44 Sahib Bandgi
Observation of fast, thithis (auspicious time), festivities
which have been created by Kaal or other type of Bhaktis
(devotions) should be given up. You have been released
from Illusion, Maya and other type of Bhaktis. Do not
divert your mind from your Satguru (Satya bhakti- Satguru
bhakti). Do not get into any other form of Bhakti, which
will cause annoyance to your Satguru.
You need not have to perform rituals, etc. for the
simple reason, your Dhyaan will be diverted. All these are
part of other lower types of Bhakti (Devotion). All you
need is to be devoted to your Satguru and praise only him.
Sukhan, etc. are not to be continued. If you started
before the Naamdaan, there is no necessity to complete it
after Naamdaan. Since Satguru has cleansed all the sins
committed of the past, on the day of Naamdaan. We do not
have any conflict with Mataji or another. All these have
been done to keep you on one-pointed concentration,do not
divide your concentration on many places.. When the lamp
of Satguru Bhakti is lighted in you, thenonly you will be
able to meditate better and you can reach Satlok.
I did visit many of the pilgrimage places. Wherever I
had been, I have enquired about the activities followed
there. I am aware about all these pilgrimage places.I have
knowledge of all religion & shastras.I have read all the
religious scriptures. Even you would not have read or
known so much. You would not have travelled that
extensively.So it is important that you are clear about it; we
have no quarrel with anyone. Nevertheless, not all these
can extend anything to your Atma (in liberation). Further,
if your attention is on two, you will be unable to practice
Satguru Bhakti. That is why, I keep you always closer.
There is only one mind, therefore fix it in one place only.
In brief, other than Satguru bhakti (devotion to guru),
do not contemplate on any other type of Bhakti. Do not
engage in such activity that will involve other forms of
devotion. Do not perform any act that will be-little your


The Real Disciple 45
Gurubhakti. Otherwise your Dhyaan (meditation) will get
divided and diverted and you will get trapped in the world
of Kalpurush. Keep your complete and an unwavering faith
in Satguru. On the other hand, if you keep all kind of
practices, it amounts to lack of faith in your Satguru. We
have to surrender with complete faith in Satguru to escape
from all these diversions otherwise; we have no conflict
with others. They have their own utility and limits. You
have to rise among them and reach the level of Satguru
Bhakti. You have to lead a new lease of life in which you
will seek nothing other than Satguru. Whatever acts you
have committed earlier, forget it (before Naamdaan).
Nothing will affect or harm you. Whatever difficult
condition a disciple faces, he should seek none other than
his Satguru.
_Sukh Mey Tujhey Na Bhulu, Dukh Mey Na Haar Manu|
Esa Prabhav Bhar De, Mere Adhir Man Mey||_
All these have been said to keep you free from Mind
centric (Manmukh).
From the Manmukhata, you have to move on to
Gurumukhata (Satguru centric). Is there anything to
accomplish becoming a Gurumukhi? Dharmadas put a
query to Sahib, "Oh Sahib, and Oh graceful one, what is
identification of a Gurumukhi?" Sahibji replied:
_Jab Lag Tan Mey Hans Rahai|Nirkhe Shabda Antey Nahi Jai||_
Till the time there is a life force in the body, do not
deviate from the word of Satguru (Mantra moolam guru
vakyam).
_Guru Aagya Nirkhat Rahe, Jaise Manihi Bhujang|_
Keep your attention always on the words of the
Satguru. Snake is called as Bhujang. It keeps its attention
all the time on Mani (gem crystallized out of its poison,
which is self-luminous). When it requires, it brings out of
it, but keeps its unwavering attention on that.
_Kahey Kabir Dharmadas Se, Yaha Gurumukh Ko Aang||_
This is the Gurumukh. With this, heart will be
illumined, bad traits will be destroyed. Gurunanakji says:


46 Sahib Bandgi
_Shabda Hi Seve So Gurumukh Hoi||_
What did I tell you first? Whatever I told you, there is
no selfishness involved. For whose benefit? only for your
good and benefit.
If someone utters 50 lies in a day and claims to be a
devotee, it is blasphemy. Even you will not give any value
to such a claim. The others, who drink and move with a
drunken state, also will not be acceptable to you as a
devotee. Those who leave their wife and indulge in
adultery will have no good opinion in your view. You will
also consider those who gamble, as useless. Those who are
dishonest and cheat will find no importance in your view.
Those who kill the living beings , where is the place for
them in your heart.
All these things are bad characters or vices. I have
asked you to be free of all these. There is no goodness in
any of these. Why did I tell this? Otherwise, you will be
unworthy. In following my words, your level has risen. At
times, it so happens that you feel what Guru says is not
correct and what comes to my mind is correct. Never think
so. If you follow the mind, it will drown you in the world
therefore always be submissive to Guru. Do not mentally
scheme.
_Naam Satya Guru Satya Ho, Aap Satya Jo Hoi|
Teen Satya Jab Ek Ho, Vish Se Amrut Hoi||_
What is the third "Aap Satya". It means, whatever Guru
says keep following faithfully. Do not interpret with your
Mind or discriminate. What Guru says, follow it faithfully
(Mantra moolam guru vakyam).
_Khak Ho Guru Ke Charan Mey, Toh Tujhey Manjil Miley||_
Do not think that what comes to your Mind is correct.
_Mujhey Hai Kam Satguru Se, Duniya Ruthe Toh Ruthan De||_
There may be occasion when everyone will say," This
is correct and what Guru says is incorrect" nevertheless,
follow what Guru says. A Mahapurush does not follow the
stream of world. He moves away from that stream. He is


The Real Disciple 47
free from the influence of Mind and Maya therefore follow
him. Enough! You will be enriched.
Worldly people will say, bow down at such and such a
place. Do not feel that world will be angry with you. Let
them be so.
_Guru Agya Le Avahi, Guru Agya Le Jai|
Kahey Kabir Va Das Fir, Bahu Vidhi Amrut Pai||_
There is nothing more important than following words
of Satguru. Those who faithfully follow words of Satguru
are considered as Gurumukh.
_Guru Agya Le Aavhi, Guru Agya Le Jaai||_
This is Guru Bhakti.
_Guru Bhakti Atal Amaan Adol Dharman, Yaha Saras Duja Nahi|
Jap Yog Vrath Tap Daan Puja, Truna Sadrusha Yaha Jag Kahi||_
Pilgrimage and ritualistic worship are worth nothing
when compared to Satguru Bhakthi. Serve with your Mind,
Body and Wealth. This is the merit of Guruseva. Sahibji
says:
_Guruseva Jo Kare Subhaga| Janam Janam Ka Patak Bhaga||_
The sins of the present and past lives will be washed
away.
_Guruseva Se Hrudai Prakashe||_
Your heart will be illumined.
_Durmati Bhage Paatak Nashey||_
The mental flaws will vanish. Sins will be destroyed.
Subhaga here means fortunate one. Service to the Satguru
will be fulfilled. This will happen in three ways.
At one place, Sahibji tells about the four Dharma,
which are to be observed by the disciple. The disciple
should have these four, righteousness.
**Firstly:**
_Tan Mann Dhan Se Guru Ki Seva||_
Serving the Guru helps others to attain spiritual
knowledge of the Lord. For this reason, scriptures give
importance to Guruseva.
In order to take a place in the heart of Guru, Guru Seva
should be done with the dedication. Otherwise, you can


48 Sahib Bandgi
never make it in your lifetime. Nanakji does not say like
that-'Suseva bas sahiba|' Sahibji says:
_Naamvant Bahute Mile, Dhyaanvant Anek|
Kahey Kabir Dharmadas Se, Guruvanta Koi Ek||_
**Secondly,**
_Seva Mey Vishai Ko Tyaage||_
He should give up pleasurable pursuits of the world
while engaged in seva. While spending whole day in play
and engage in pleasurable pursuits and if you assume
yourself as a devotee, it will be incorrect. His conduct
should be different. His day-to-day activity should be
suffused with devotional feelings.
**Thirdly-**
_Man Mey Ahankaar Na Aney||_
You should not pride that you are offering seva. and
**Fourthly-**
_Guru Ke Shabdh Pratithi||_
Love for the word of Guru.
Sahib says:
_Guru Agya Le Aavhi, Guru Aagya Le Jahi|
Kahey Kabir Ta Das Ko, Teen Lok Dar Naahi||
Guru Samarth Jehi Khade, Kami Kahu Ko Das|
Riddhi Siddhi Seva Kare, Mukti Na Chade Saath||_
Believe that all the above four Dharma should be there
in a disciple. Out of the four, two are very important.
_Guru Seva Bhaki Nischai Kar||_
First, service to the Guru then faith in the Guru's word.
It means faith on the promise.
_Jo Koi Gahe Chale Yam Jiti||_
Those who observe these two, they will succeed
crossing the worldly ocean of life and reach the
destination.
_Guru Shishya Aur Ishwar, Mil Kinha Bhakti Vivek|
Teeno Tridhara Bani, Aagey Ganga Ek||
Guru Samana Shishya Mey, Shishya Liya Kar Neh|
Bilgaye Bilgey Nahi, Ek Roop Do Deh||_
Sahibji has indicated that much.


The Real Disciple 49
_Guru Ka Kathan Maan Sab Lijiye|
Satya Asatya Vichaar Na Kijiye||_
Sahibji says that follow all that which Guru says
sincerely. Do not think whether it is right or wrong.
Just like the soil, condition should be good for yield of
crop. A farmer should be knowledgeable. In the same way,
after Naam initialization, disciple should be of good
character.
_Khelna Ho To Kheliye, Pakka Hokar Khel|
Kacchi Sarso Per Ke, Khadi Bhaya Na Tel||_
Disciple should attend as many Satsang as possible and
achieve nearness. The more you sit in the Satsang, the
more you will grow in devotion of Satguru. This is better
than Dhyaan and Bhajan. Till one attends Satsang,
devotion cannot develop. Goswamiji says-
_Bhakti Swatantra Sakal Gun Khaani| Binu Satsang Na Pavat
Praani||
Bhakti Nirupan Vividh Vidhaana|Kshama Daya Sat Shil
Nidhaana||_
Devotion is that, which yields the fruit of good
character. Now what is Satsang, we take some story as
Satsang. Story means that which has passed happened.
Sahib lovingly says,
_Mala Lakkad Puja Patthar,Tirth Hai Sab Paani|
Kahey Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Charo Ved Kahani||_
Satsang originates from the Heart by intuition, whereas
Story from the Mind. Anyone can tell the Story. Story is
learnt by heart, memorize and told. However, devotion
develops from Satsang.
Let us understand what Devotion is, it also means
sacrificing sensual pleasures. Sahibji says that all are
unable to sacrifice sensual pleasures.
_Chaudaha Lok Basey Bhag Mahi| Bhag Se Koi Nyaara Nahi||_
No one is above that.
_Gyaan Chadariya Jisney Lini, Maili Kar Dhar Dini|
Ek Kabira Jatan Sey Lini, Jyo Ki Tyo Dhar Dini|
Chadariya Zini Re Zini||_


50 Sahib Bandgi
You can notice,in Satsang some speaker start crying
and sometime become emotional. A Sant Mahapurush does
not do this because;
_Man Hi Rovey, Man Hi Gavey...|_
Sahib Says.
_Bahar Na Dikhlaaiye, Andar Kijiye Heth||_
All this are mental responses, do not take this as
Bhakti- devotion. Ringing a big bell is not Bhakti; this is a
play of Kalpurush. We do observe that some try to display
devotion through external signs or markings. Some try to
keep a pleasant looking appearance. Sahib says this is not
Devotion.
Therefore, first we have to understand the person who
imparts Bhakti, see whether he has realization of the
supreme lord or just narrates stories. If he fits the
description and identity of a complete Guru or Satguru,
above the senses, not married, or on attaining realization,
Spiritual wisdom of Parmpurush, he gives up all worldly
bondages and become a Sanyasi, understands that his
nearness is true Satsang. The Satsang of such Sant even for
a moment is considered;-
_Saat Swarg O Apvarg, Dharo Tula Ik Aang|
Tahi Sakal Mil Nah Tule, Ja Kshan Lo Satsang||_
In the Satsang three things are mainly attained, has
three benefits. First, in the Satsang we get the answer to
our doubts. When we listen to the Satsang of a real
Satguru, we can realize their intellectual brilliance. You
will receive all answer to your queries. There is difference
between Satsang and Story. In the Katha, you can hear the
stories from Veda's and shastras, it has description of
incidents. We are not against this. Sants- Satguru talk of
Atmic-Spiritual Knowledge, this clears the doubts and
query. The darkness in the heart is removed.
Secondly, in the presence of a Satguru you can attain
one pointedness- Ekagratha, the entire environment gets
one pointed. Such Mahatmas will not grow matted hair and
color his cloth


The Real Disciple 51
_Mann Na Rangaye Yogi, Kapda Rangaye Liya||_
Common people's concentration revolves on the world
and so it becomes dull. Nearness to a Sant helps to
improve concentration and his awareness improves.
Thirdly, an Adhyatmic-Spiritual power radiates from
Satguru's body and enters us. We can receive this even
while listening to him.
His rays, also charges the environment. Even scientists
are also agree that everyone has his unique aura. If
someone visits your home, his or her rays will remain for
some days. This you can even come to know that someone
is about to visit. When you remember a person, he comes
there. You even say, "I was thinking about you". It means
his rays reached there before his arrival. You come know
that he is coming. When the Spiritual rays reach you from
a Satguru, it will help you to realize your existence.
_Kabir Sangat Sadhu Ki, Jyo Gandhi Ki Baas|
Jyo Gandhi Kuchh Det Nahi, To Bhi Baas Suvaas||_
You will obtain very powerful Spiritual energies from a
Mahatma, which you cannot achieve even with hard
Sadhana. When you are blessed with Diksha from Satguru,
you receive the power of Naam as a core. Then everything
becomes different.
....When you receive the rays from the body of a
Mahatma, you will experience inner peace.
Scientist says that Rose flower has an influence on
Mind, it has a soothing effect. Pandit Nehru always kept a
Rose flower with him. When you reach near the Rose
flower, it gives a delightful sensation. In the same way the
Adhyatmic rays of Satguru's body, helps you attain peace.
Therefore, you get benefits from their Darshan- Auspicious
Sight.
_Kabira Man Panchhi Bhaya, Udd Ke Chala Aakash|
Swarg Lok Khali Pada, Sahib Santan Paas||_
Ramayan also says;
_Nahi Daridra Sam Dukh Jam Aana|
Sant Milan Sam Dukh Nahi Jaana||_


52 Sahib Bandgi
Therefore, in the Satsang of Sants, you will build faith
and your conscience will accept it hence Sants ask you to
attend Satsangs regularly. Therefore, choose your Satguru
carefully; it should not create any doubt later. First you are
free so clear all your doubts. Satsang is an opportunity to
clear your doubts and confusion.
Apart from this, whenever you get opportunity have
Satguru's Darshan whatever may be the occasion.
_Guru Ka Darshan Kijiye, Din Mey Kai Kai Baar|
Asuya Ka Meh Jyo, Bahut Karey Upkar||_
What is there in the first raindrop? When drop of Swati
Nakshatra falls in oyster's stomach, pearl is formed and
when the drop falls on bamboo, it forms Banslochan; when
drop falls on stone, mercury is formed; when it falls on
elephant's ear, an elephant gem (Gajmukh) is formed; when
it falls on banana plant, camphor is formed. There is lot of
benefit in it. In the same way, darshan of complete Guru,
Satguru is beyond description. It is necessary to have
auspicious sight of Satguru. This constitutes Guru Bhakti.
There is a great significance in Satguru's darshan. For this
reason, Sahibji says, "Take as many Darshan as possible in
a day".
Why such an importance to Guru Darshan? What do
you get from the auspicious sight of Sadguru? Let us move
further on this subject.
Man has three powers in him-" Bhautik, Divya and
Adhyathmic". From the point of worldly views (Bhautik
dristi), human body is very competent. With **Bhautik
power** , he is changing and utilizing the world. He has
created wonderful things. Just as, our children complete the
task which we have created, Paramatma Niranjan has
created all himself, Stars, Sun, Moon, Earth, and Water
Mountains ETC. However if someone has made the world
beautiful it is only Human beings. He made passage cutting
through mountains, Made Houses, very tall buildings all
these are by human effort not by paramatma, then he also


The Real Disciple 53
made Telephone, Airplane and what not, Paramatma did
not drop all these from Sky, Its only Human who created
all these. Worldly power-bhautik shakti is behind all these.
However all these have Limitations. If someone thinks of
flying, he cannot fly; this faculty does not exist in Human.
Sight has limitation in its range that which is too far cannot
be seen. Therefore, eye has it limits. Similarly Ear cannot
hear, if someone say something shouting from one
Kilometer distance. Therefore, Bhautik Shakti has a
limitation. Yet we can accomplish many great things.
Higher than this is **Divya Shakti-Divine Powers** , these
powers are within the reach of Man, but he is not aware of
it. It remains within our body centered at five locations in
us. common people are ignorant of these powers and not
making use of it. If you do not use an item for a long time,
it becomes defective. Just like a car, remaining idle for
two, three months cannot start and creates difficulties is
restarting. Since men are not using this power, it remains
dormant.
Yogis manifest these powers with Dhyan-Meditation.
Therefore, they take a higher position and are superior.
Some yogis meditate at the center point between their eye,
with concentration they awaken the sleeping power; use
them to rise above the ordinary people. Common people
cannot meet them eye to eye, because their intellect is
highly illumined. Some Yogis meditate on the centre of
their fore head, (Agya chakra) and with concentration, they
awaken the dormant power. Some yogis Meditate in the
Bunk Naal and listen with concentration to the sound
(Anahad dhun), and manifest many divine powers. Above
these are Unnmani and Khechari Mudras with Divine
powers.
Above those five centers or Mudras and its Divya
Shakti is the place of **Adhyatmik Shakti** , Power of Spirit
or Spiritual Power. This remains in every one's
concentration- Surti, but no one can acquire this power by


54 Sahib Bandgi
his own effort. _'Bin Satguru Pavey Nahi, Koi Kotin Karey
Upai|_ ' Therefore, the key to manifest **Adhyatmic power** is
with Sant Satguru only, that is why without the krupa-
grace of Sant Satguru it cannot be manifested. A Baby
needs breast-feeding, it is its sustenance, so also the Dhyan
of Satguru is a source of energy for Spiritual awareness
(Dhyan Moolam Guru Roopam) for his disciple. This is
Sahaj Marg- Easy Path, even without any hard
Sadhana(worship), you will attain progress.
A man from military came to me, he said that he was
very cruel man, whomever I saw, I use to beat them, but
now I am different, I don't understand how all this
happened. I explained to him:-
I- This is due to the power of Dhyan.
He- I never do any Dhyan.
I- This is with the Power of Naam.
He - I do not do any Naam recitation.
I- This is the effect of Satsang.
He- I do not listen to Satsang
I- This is the power of Darshan
He- Yes I come for Darshan Most of the time
In truth at first, I did not want to disclose this, however
at the end; I had to compulsorily reveal the truth. You get
charged in Darshan (Aspicious sight of Satguru). Dhyan is
done due to lack of opportunity to have Darshan.
When we have the Darshan of Sant Satguru, we receive
**Adhyatmic powers in three ways;-
Through power of Sight;** first, when their sight falls on us
we receive the Adhyatmic power from them. That is why,
when we meet Satguru,we request for graceful glance.
See, how Gandhari made Duriyodhan's body like a stone
with her sight. She could transmit her Divine power
through her power of sight. If divine power, can be
transmitted through sight, why not Adhyatmic powers.
**Through Speech-words;** Through the sound of speech,
this power can reach us. That is why Satsang is very


The Real Disciple 55
beneficial. _'Dhanya Ghadi Jab Ho Satsanga'_ | You might
have heard that some Rishi through curse burned someone
to ashes. It means through vani- speech Divine power was
transmitted. Similarly, Adhyatmic power also can be
passed on.
**Through Touch,** In the same way we can receive
Adhyatmic-Spiritual powers through touch. The touch
could be made anywhere for receiving the power, however,
a code of conduct is observed, touch only the feet.
Therefore, Satguru's Darshan is very essential. If you are
residing closer, keep taking his Darshan. Sahibji says;-
_Kai Bar Na Hoi Sakey, Doi Vakth Kar Lei|
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Kaal Daga Nahi Dei||_
If not many times, at least do twice a day. Kalpurush's
influence will diminish with this. If this is not possible,
then Sahib says;
_Doi Vakth Na Ho Sakey, Din Mey Karey Ik Baar|
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Utare Bhavjal Paar||_
Sahib says, Have Darshan at least once a day, you will
cross the worldly ocean of life-sansar. Just as your body
feels weak if you do not take food for a day, strength of the
body reduces a bit, because energy is derived from the food
consumed. However if you take food the next day the body
recovers. Sahib says;
_Ek Din Na Kari Sakey, Duje Din Kari Lehi|
Satguru Darshan Ke Kiye, Pavey Uttam Dehi||_
Even if this is not possible, meaning, you are at distance,
Sahib gives solution:
_Duje Din Na Kar Sakey, Chauthey Din Kar Jai|
Satguru Darshan Key Kiye, Moksh Mukti Phal Paai||_
Try the fourth day; you will earn the right to Moksha. If you
do not get food for three days, body suffers, however if take
food on the fourth day you will still recover. Similarly, the
dominating influence of Mind will grow, however the
Adhyatmic rays received by the Darshan of Satguru will reverse
it back. Atma is covered with the sheath of Mind and Maya; you
need a lot of Adhyatmic power to prevent their grip. Therefore,


56 Sahib Bandgi
you need to take frequent Darshan of Satguru. However if it is
not possible due to great distance, sahib says;
_Chauthey Din Nahi Kar Sakey, Vaar-Vaar Karu Jaay|
Yamey Vilamb Na Kijiye, Kahey_ Kabir Samuzay||
Sahib alerts; If it is not possible on the fourth day, at least
take Darshan once a week. Do not postpone or delay.
Otherwise, Atma will become weak and Mind's disturbance will
increase. Adhyatmic power removes the grip of Mind and Maya
on Atma, so take Satguru Darshan as often as you can. You will
face a lot of hindrance, overcome this. Sahib says
_Mata Pita Sut Stri, Bandhu Kutumb Ko Jaan|
Guru Darshan Ko Jab Chale, Yeh Athkave Aan||
Unka Atka Na Rahe, Guru Darshan Ko Jaay|
Kahey Kabir So Sant Jan, Moksh Mukti Phal Paai||_
Sahib Says that, all these will impede Guru Darshan, but do
not stop, you have to receive the Adhyatmic powers.
Tree takes its nutrients from the Soil, even than it needs
some power, which is energy from the Sun, without which Tree
cannot grow. Likewise even with yoga if Man acquires
miraculous powers with this he cannot cross the worldly ocean
of life. You need the Adhyatmic power form Sant Satguru to
overcome this. Sahib says:
_Abhi Nahi Guru Ka Baccha, Abhi Kaccha Rey Kaccha|
Kahi Gupt Kahi Pargat Hovey, Gokul Mathura Kashi|
Pavan Chadavey Siddh Kahavey, Hoi Surya Lok Ka Vaasi|
Tabhu Nahi Guru Ke Baccha, Abhi Kaccha Rey Kaccha||_
Even if you get the power to appear and disappear at various
places at the same time like disappearing in Jammu and
appearing at Kashi or disappearing in Mathura an appearing in
Kashi, even then, understand that you have not yet obtained
Adhyathmic Shakti. Therefore, you are raw (kaccha). Till the
time you receive the core Adhyatmic power from Satguru, you
will be incomplete. He further says:
_Kari Asnaan Babhut Chadhavey, Bahu Agni Udgaare Ga|
Jal Ke Upar Aasan Marey, Jo Bole So Hovega|
Tabhu Nahi Guru Ka Baccha, Abhi Kaccha Re Kaccha||_
Even if you have Vak siddhi means what you tell will
happen even then you are not complete.
_Jo Koi Kahe Purush Avinaashi, Jyoti Swarup Lakhavega|_


The Real Disciple 57
_Ved Vividh Ke Maarag Chhane, Tan Lakkad Kari Darega|
Tabhu Nahi Guru Ka Baccha, Abhi Kaccha Re Kaccha||_
Even if one has the knowledge of all the four Vedas and
reduces his body to skeleton in penance, still he is not complete-
'kaccha rey kaccha'-raw. Sahibji further says:
_Jogi Hoyike Jog Kamavey, Rom Rom Kari Chhanega|
Teen Lok Mey Kuchh Na Chhode, Pura Jog Kamavega|
Tabhu Nahi Guru Ka Baccha, Abhi Kaccha Re Kaccha||_
Mastering all yogas and attains power, even if he moves all
over the three worlds, still he cannot be called disciple of Guru.
Know that he is imperfect-'kaccha rey kaccha'-raw.
_Ek Shunya Ko Kaun Kahavey, Saath Shunya Le Javega|
Mahashunya Par Aasan Mare, Soham Ka Ghar Pavega|
Tabhu Nahi Guru Ka Baccha, Abhi Kaccha Re Kaccha||_
If one reaches Mahashunya, crossing the Shunya(void dark
space) and even attains Soham, still he is incomplete. Even after
attaining all that, he is still considered incomplete- kaccha
because, he is yet to receive Adhyathmic rays from Satguru.
Therefore:
_Jog Bhog Se Nyaara Hovey, Nirakshar Nahi Bhavega|
Had Behad Ajapa Se Bhage, Nij Swarup Ko Pavega|
Ab Bhaya Re Guru Ka Baccha, Ab Pakka Re Pakka||
Kahe Kabir Thahar Pad Apney, Jo Teen Kal Nahi Naasat|
Naam Rup Yash Joda Bahute, Parkhat Chhute Sausat|
Ab Bhaya Re Guru Ka Baccha, Ab Pakka Re Pakka||_
Rising above Yoga and enjoyment, if one receives Naam
from a Satguru then he can become a child of Guru. Only then
he is ripe-complete otherwise he will remain is Kaccha (raw). It
means, the Naam, which Satguru has given, is a core
Adhyathmic power (rays). Without which, an individual cannot
cross-worldly ocean of life (Sansaar). With the continued
Darshan of Satguru, this power increases. Even through
meditation of Satguru after Naamdaan, one can increase this
power but if the Guru is in the front, it increases many fold.
Meditation is done due to lack of opportunity for Darshan of
Satguru. In the meditation, you make effort to keep the true
living form of Satguru in your memory-chitt, which can grant
power. If the Guru is in the front, you receive the Adhyatmic
power directly. Therefore, as per scriptures, when we go in front


58 Sahib Bandgi
of Guru, we should have his darshan and receive the rays and
not to meditate with closing the eye. Highlighting the
importance of Satguru's darshan, sahibji says:
_Bar-Bar Na Kari Sake, Pakshe Paksha Kare Soy|
Kahe Kabir ta daas ka,Janam Sufal hi hoy|_
Sahibji says, if not every week, have darshan every fifteen
days, you will succeed in crossing the Sansaar. If due to some
reason, if you are unable to do even that because of your
entanglement with the worldly problems, even for this, Sahibji
says:
_Pakshe paksh na kari sake, mas mas karu jaai|
Yame der na laayiye, kare kabir samujaay||_
Sahibji alerts saying that you should have Darshan in a
month. You have to reach once in the month. It is less, the
minds influence will increase. Still, if you take Darshan at least
once in a month, rays of power can be compensated for the
reduction due to delay.
In the times of predicament, at least do meditation of a
Satguru. If possible go for Darshan and if not due to worldly
problems, you can do meditation. If you reside far away and you
have lack of resources, considerate Sahibji says:
_Mas- Mas Na Kari Sake, Chhate Maas Albatt|
Ya Me Dheel Na Kijiye, Kahe Kabir Avigatt||_
Have Darshan, every six months do not delay. Otherwise,
the power will dissipate and Atma will become weak and
mistakes will multiply. However, if the disciple is at a long
distance from Guru, and reaching every six months is not
practicable, only for them Sahibji gives a final solution:
_Chhate Maas Na Kari Sake, Baras Dina Kari Lehi|
Kahe Kabir So Sant Jan, Yamhi Chunauti Dehi||_
Sahibji says for those who cannot visit even once in six
months, have Darshan at least once in a year. They can even
challenge Yamdut and attain salvation.
If a devotee fails to reach even once a year, Sahibji has no
remedy for him.
_Baras Baras Na Kari Sake, Taako Lage Dosh|
Kahe Kabir Va Jiv So, Kabhu Na Pave Moksh||_
Disciple should raise the glory of Satguru. It destroys sin.
Even forgetfully, you should not denounce your Guru. If you


The Real Disciple 59
happen to be with a Guru before you come to me, you should
not denounce even him. Even if you know that, he cannot do
well to your spiritual attainment, so you come to me, and then
you should not denounce him. It will be harmful. Whatever he
may be. You should never oppose anyone whom you have taken
as Guru. If he is unable to help you, in crossing the ocean of
life, then quietly look for a competent Guru and seek his feet.
However, do not hate or oppose the earlier Guru. Then
opposing a true Satguru is sinful even to hear.
Be humble before your Satguru and do not show your ego.
You have to tell him about your deficiencies so that he can
correct them. If you boost yourself, nothing will remain with
you. Sahibji says:
_Satguru Ki Maryada Na Dharai|
Lakh Chauraasi Kund Me Parai|
Guru Ka Shabda Na Suney Agyaani|
Bhavsagar Dube Abhimaani||_
Sahibji says you should always be respectful and obedient to
Satguru. Those who indulge in disrespect, will take birth in 84
lakhs of jivas.
_Guru Ko Dekhi Dharat Abhimana|
Vyas Bachan Pad Naraknidhana||_
The One Who Displays Ego, In Front Of Guru Will End Up In
Hell.
_Guru Ko Gyan Meyti Mat Thapi|Tin Lok Mey Bado Tey Papi||
Guru Ko Meyti Bakhanat Aapa|Dharti Bhar Marat Tehi Papa||
Guru Sey Uncha Chadhi Baithey| Saat Kund Narak Mey
Paithey||_
The one who displays his knowledge in front of Guru, he is
considered the big sinner in all the three worlds. Even the earth
cannot bear his weight. He is the one who tries to take higher
place than his Guru does. The one who does this, he falls into
the Sapta Kumbhi hell.
_Guru Se Ulta Bachan Sunavey| Saat Janam Koddi Ko Pavey||
GuruKo Ulat Sunavey Baina|SaatJanam Andha HoySo Naina||_
The one who argues with his Guru and replies arrogantly,
his body will suffer Leprosy or he will remain blind for seven
lives.
_Guru Ko Chhod Dev Jo Pujey| Badur Hoy Divas Nahi Sujey||_


60 Sahib Bandgi
_Guru Ko Chhod Anat Jo Aavey|Uluk Hoy So Janam Gavavey||_
Those who instead of worshiping their Satguru, worship
gods and demigods, he has no understanding; therefore he takes
the body of a Lizard or an Owl and wastes his life.
Sahibji alerts that we should stay respectful to Guru.
_SatguruKiJo Adab NaRakhey|Takho Dojakh Shastar Bhakey||
Satguru Ki Na Laaye Vishvasa| Tako Kaal Karat Hai Grasa||
Guruseti Guman Janavey| Janam Janam So Yaampur Javey|
Gurusang Aadi Tedhi Boley| Shwan Hoy So Ghar Ghar Doley||
Gurusang Gyan Garv Dikhavey| Koti Janam Kukar Ko Pavey||
GuruSey Baad Karey Narnari|Koti Janam Sey Narak Muhjari||
Guru Ko Shabda Meti Pag Dharai|Yaam Kikar Ke fandey
Parai||_
Therefore, Sahibji reminds saying:
_Kijey Guru Ki Sada Badhai| Tatey Jiv Narak Na Jai||_
Always praise the glory of Satguru. With this, all sins will
be destroyed.
_Guru Mahima Sabtey Adhikai|
Shiv Shivaprati Yahi Drudhai||
Vyas Vachan Aau Ved Gaaya|
Guru Sey Adhik Nahi Raghuraya||_
Sahibji says, singing the glory of Satguru is supreme. Vyas
also talked about Guru and Vedas talk about the significance of
Guru. Ramachandra was never placed above Gurus.
_Guru Ninda Chodo Sujan, Guru Stuti Maan Dhaari|
Guru Ko Rakho Shish Par, Sab Vidhi Karey Guhari||_
Therefore, giving up the opposition, praise the Guru.
Keeping your Guru on head, meaning giving him a higher level,
pray before him.
There is no greater sin than speaking against the Guru; so
keep away from this act. Whatever may be the condition of
Guru, do not demean. Sahib says:
_Guru Ninda Jakey Mukh Upjey|Koti Janam Gadha Ho Nipjey||_
Sahibji says, whoever speaks hatred words about Guru from
his mouth, will be born as a donkey for crores of lives.
_Guru Ninda Jakey Mukh Hoi| Tako Mukh Na Dekho Koi||_
See what Sahibji says. He says not to look at the face of a
person who ill his Guru. He is a great sinner. It is even a sin to
look at such person.


The Real Disciple 61
_Guru Ki Ninda Suney Jo Kana| So To Pavey Narak Nidhana||
Guru Nindak Narayan Hoi| Vako Mukh Na Dekho Koi||_
Those who listens to accusation on his Guru, he is also
destined for hell. Those who accusing Guru, do not even look at
him even if he is Paramatma. See how strong his words are!
_Guru Nindak Jo Vachan Sunavey|
Gyani Kaan Mundi Key Javey||_
Sahibji says, if you see any opponent of your Guru, do not
listen to him. Men of wisdom (Gyaani) will close his ear and
walk away from there.
Speaking about the glory of Satguru, Sahibji says:
_Yog Yagya Aaru Jaap Taap Ahai|
Padhi Guru Mahima Sab Phal Ahai||
Ek Baar Guru Mahima Padhai|So Fal Sabhi KshanMey Lahai||
Guru Mahima Saar Ko Saari| Gihijapati Bhashyo Tripurari||_
Sahibji says, all that you can earn with Yog, Yagya, Jap,
Tap, etc. such hard practices can be obtained with the praise of
glory of Guru, in a moment. Singing the glory of Guru is greater
than the greatest. This is a higher form of devotion. Therefore,
Shivji also talked about the importance of Guru.
Always speak in a pleasantly in front of Satguru.
_Dou Kar Jori Guru Key Aagey|Kari Bahu Vinti Charanan Lagey||
Ati Shital Boley Sab Baina| Metey Sakal Kap Key Baina||
Hey Guru Tum Ho Dindayala| Mey Hu Din Karo Pratipala||
Tum Bandichhor AatihiAnatha|Bhavjal Budat Pakado Hatha||
Yo Adhin Hoy Shish Jabhi|ShishPar Krupa Karey Guru Tabhi||_
Sahibji says, only by total surrender to the Guru, disciple
receives his Grace.
It does not mean praise him in the front and speak against
him at the back; exhibit love externally and keep enmity inside.
Do not be like that. Sahib says on this:
_Sanmukh GuruKi Aagya Dhare|Aru Pichhe Tou Sakal Nivare||
SoShishGhorNarakMeyParihey|RudhirRadhPaveyNahi Tarhe||
Mukh Par Bachan Karey Parmana| Ghar Par jay Karey

Vedh Puran Kahey Sab Sakhi| Sakhi Shabd Sabey Yo Bhaki||
Manush Janam Paykar Khove|Satguru Vimukha YugYug Rove||_


62 Sahib Bandgi
Vedas and Puraanas also talks about this that those who turn
away from Guru, he destroys his Human life. Such disciple will
find no other place.
All those Mahapurushas who appeared on this Earth had
adopted Gurus and they sang the glories of Guru. Then why
should an ordinary person be egoistic? Sahib says:
_Arsath Tirat Bhram (2) Aavey|So Phal GuruKe Charanan Pave||_
Sahibji says, the merits one earns in going on pilgrimage can
be obtained from the feet of Guru in a moment. Therefore, there
is no need to go anywhere; stay at the feet of Guru. The one
who does this, for him Sahibji says-
_GuruKo Taje Bhajey Jo Aana|Ta Pashu Yako Phokat Gyana||_
Understand that he is devoid of any wisdom. One has to
surrender to Satguru. You should earn the merit for being
blessed with a Satguru. What should we do? What Sahib says as
merit? He gives the example of Bhrunga (an insect). It takes any
Larva and with his sound makes a Larva into another Bhrunga
but there is a requirement here.
_Bhrungi Shabd Kitt Jo Mana| Varan Pher Aapan Kar Jana||
Koi Koi Kitt Param Sukhdai| Pratham Awaz Gahey Chitlai||
Koi Dujey Koi Tije Maney|Tan Maan Rahit Shabd Hitt Janey||
Bhrungi Shabd Kitt Na Gahai| Tou Puni Kitt Aasare Rahai||_
Some Larvae catches the sound in its very first attempt,
some on the second or third time. There are some Larves, which
does not succeed. It listens to the sound but gets frightened,
becomes uncomfortable. Just like when mother takes children to
Mahapurushas for salutation (Bandgi). The child cries, they
think that he may be a doctor who will give an injection because
of his earlier visit to a doctor. Similarly, the Larva gets
frightened for the fear of being eaten. But Bhrunga is Larva’s
well-wisher,it gives pleasure.
_Guru shabda nischay satya maaney, bhrungi maat tab pavai|
Taji Sakal Aasa Shabda Basa, Kaga Hans Kahavai||_
Like that, Guru's words gives pleasure. Bhrunga vibrates
with the sound of Bhu- Bhu. Some Larvae does not respond to
the very first sound. Why, because he does not surrender itself.
Until it surrenders, it does not transform. Bhrunga gives up after
the third attempt. It goes on search for other Larvae.
_Toh Puni Kitt Aasrey Rahai..._


The Real Disciple 63
Then it cannot transform into a Bhrunga, it remains to be an
ordinary insect. Swami Paramanand says with sweetness-
_Bhrungi Jo Aan Kit Ko Khud Rang Lagavey|
Awaz Apni Aansikh Kaan Sikhavey||
Vaha Rup Pahala Raha Ek Na Baki|

Among lakhs of Larvae, only rare Larva qualifies which
Bhrunga tries repeatedly to transform it to a Bhrunga. Bhrunga
gives his heart and makes it like himself. Therefore, it is said
that you have to offer your all to one who deserves it and has
the requisite merit.
This way, it requires surrender. A thought may arise in mind
as to why it necessary. In reality, all the three (Body, Mind and
Wealth) are cause for bondage. Atma takes it that wealth is
needed for which it performs many actions (Karmas). Why
Guru ask for Body, Mind & Wealth. Because Atma takes itself
as Body.As Atma accept that it is a body, at that moment it has
become an error and started working for its sustainance.
_Jabtey Jiv Bhayo Sansari| Chhutey Na Granthi Na Hoy Sukhari||_
Then it takes wealth as its own, it struggles to earn it, be it
fair or foul. It struggles very hard. This way mind pervades the
entire universe and becomes the cause of bondage.


64 Sahib Bandgi
Guru had taken all these three.What is the significance of
these three? If Guru takes your Body, firstly illusion (confusion)
gets over that I am a body. If Guru takes your Wealth it ends
your greed. What is mind? It is the Intellect, memory and ego
(action). Do not involve in this. Why is it, so? Whatever you
accomplish with mind, it will be fraudulent and that we
accomplish with memory (chitt) and ego; will end in
destruction. All these four aspects of mind create illusion.
Therefore, you are required to surrender. Only then, you will
accept the words of Satguru. Whatever he says, welcome that.
This task is very difficult; do not use your discrimination
because it involves your intellect (Buddhi). It is an aspect of
Mind.
_Kahat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Jagat Bana Hey Maan Se||_
Mind is very complicated and terrible. It gives all kind of
information. Those who treed the path of Mind are called Maan
Mukh (Mind-centric). Its work involves deception and
cleverness. Intellect will be of no use in realisation of the
ultimate under any condition. It will alway takes you to worldly
things only, it is constructed like that.
Satguru talks about that secret , which cannot be found in
Shastras and Vedas (scriptures) and transcends much higher
than these.
_Aisa Ved Miley Koi Bhedi, Desh Videsh Pichhani|
Ta Se Pirr Kaho Tan Keri, Phiri Nahi Bharmo Khani|
Khojat Phiro Bhed Va Ghar Ka, Kou Na Karat Bakhani|
Rehdas Sant Miley Mohi Satguru, Dinhi Surat Sahidani|
Mey Mili Jai Piya Apna, Tab Mori Pirr Buzani|
Meera Khak Khalak Sirr Dari, Mey Apna Ghar Jani||_
Meera Bai says that there is no one available to show the
eternal truth and no one has given guarantee.
We have to keep complete faith in Satguru. When a child
takes milk, it contains all the required nutrients. Mother gives
this as a readymade food. Why do you seek the supreme Lord?
We believe that he is very near to us and listens to all, and yet
we are all struggling. Why? Be strong. When you treed the path
of truth, you are strained. Under these conditions, one enters the
wrong path-taking bribe etc; or he gives up and you suffer
damage or rejection. You also get depression from the world; in


The Real Disciple 65
such conditions do not get dejected. When you walk on the path
of truth, do not be discouraged. Those who can fight against
corruption, they are capable to winning any battle because
corruption is the mother of all wars. I was seeking approval for
construction of the building and it was taking time. With 500
rupees, approval would have been obtained. We kept
approaching them for two years, but did not pay 500 rupees. It
cost us more than 500 rupees for travel expenditures. At the end
out of compulsion, they approved the plan. When we come
under their spell, we become weak. In the same way, when you
step into Satya Bhakti (True Devotion), you will face
difficulties, hypocrites will confuse you. Satguru calls and
assures you of his protection. Then neither will you be affected
by Evil spirit nor by any Tantriks. When Guru says that he
(Guru) becomes target of hypocrites, they denounce that Guru.
The words of Mahapurushas bring a revolution. The one who
gives off his perceptions and ego is considered as Gurumukh
(Guru centric). Sahibji says:
_Kabira Khada Bazar Mey, Liyeluhata Haath|
Jo Ghar Phukey Aapna, Chaley Humarey Saath||_
Now the question arises, why should one merge in his Guru?
When you go to a teacher, he imparts education; when you go to
a doctor, he cures your disease; when you go to a lawyer, he
finds a solution to your problem. In the same way, Satguru has
Adhyathmic powers with him, when you seek his shelter, the "I"
ness will be removed. Only this has covered the Atma. Then it
is said:
_Guru Samana Shishya Mey, Shishya Liya Kar Neh|
Bilgaye Bilgey Nahi, Ek Rup Do Deh||_
If a disciple shows his ego in the knowledge Guru imparts, it
will be wrong. He has to give it up.
_GuruKa Vachan Man Sab Lijey|Satya Asatya VicharNa Kijey||
Guru Agya Ley Aavai, Guru Aagya Ley Jayi|
Kahe Kabir Ta Daas Ko, Teen Lok Dar Nahi||
Guru Gunge Guru Bavrey, Guru Key Rahiye Daas|
Jo Guru Bhejey Narak Mey, Toh Rakhiye Swarg Ki Aaas||_
You will face lot of difficult situations, but you should not
waver.


66 Sahib Bandgi
Yasim Kha occupied a higher place in the court of an
emperor. He was a disciple of Kamalji. The Maulvis directed
emperor to give punishment to Kamalji saying that Kamalji is
speaking against the religion. The emperor prevailed upon
Maulvis and to ask Kamalji to desist from such act but Kamalji
remained stubborn. So he ordered them "Tie Kamalji at a cross-
road and tell all those who pass on the road to throw stone on
him, spit on him or beat him. Those who do not oblige, shall
also be tied with him and treated similarly".
People were throwing all kinds of things on Kamalji but
Kamalji was smiling all the time. Yasim was his disciple; by
chance, he was passing through that place. The soldier told him
that it was under the order from the emperor that he has to throw
something on Kamalji being a higher ranked officer; it is also
his duty to follow his order. Further, the soldier said that they do
not want to be on the wrong side of the order so they requested
Yasim to throw something. Yasim was scared so, he took a
small petal of a flower and gently threw on Kamalji. Kamal
began to weep profusely. So yasim enquired with Kamalji "
Guruji, people threw stones and spitting on you but you were all
the while smiling but, however when I threw a flower, why do
you cry"? They were doing out of ignorance but you were aware
about my inner power and me. That is why; my heart is being
hurt with your throw of flower. You should have chosen to be
bond with me.
Then Yasim pleaded for his forgiveness and he felt
depressed. However, Kamalji was not satisfied. Therefore,
Yasim thought that he would go to Kabir Sahib who was the
Guru to Kamalji. Kabirji told Yasim that he cannot forgive him
and advised him to approach Guru only but you came to me
with faith, so I shall go with you. They reached Lahore. Sahibji
told Kamal that it was Yasim's mistake. Kamalji told Sahib,
"Guru, you are competent. However, he will remain here for 32
years after his death before attaining Amarlok".
Even this day, the tomb of Yasim exists in Lahore. Sahib
explains:
_Guru Gunga Guru Bavrey, Guru Key Rahiye Daas|
Jo Guru Bhejey Narak Mey, Toh Rakhiye Swarg Ki Aaas||_
What to say, if guru is pleased!


The Real Disciple 67
_Guru Prasann Sahib Anukula|Meeti Malin Maan Kalpit Sula||_
Sahib says- _'Guru Rize Toh Rizey Rama'.'Guru Ruthey Toh
Turat Manaiye'_. When is Guru pleased and when is he
displeased? When his words are followed, he is pleased and
when it is opposed, he is annoyed.
All the active mobile phones remain connected. If it is pre
paid and if the money is spent up, it will not work even with the
sim. If it is a post-paid phone and the bill is not paid, then the
company will disconnect the phone. They all know it. Similarly,
do not assume that Guru does not know what you are doing. He
knows all. Just like a person who controls the world or a prime
minister who controls the nation or a chief minister who
controls the state, a Guru can control his disciple. Why were
you asked to keep away from other modes of worship? Wife is
aware that her husband loves her and she knows that if he loves
some other woman, he will be unable to love her. Accepting all
amounts to be a prostitute.
_Ek Naam Ko Jaan Kar, Duja Dey Bahay||_
Guru likes to raise the level of faith little by little in you.
Why it is said that he hears the call of a devotee? When you call
from the depth of your heart, it reaches him but you should be
suffused with faith. A small child cries out his mother, "Hai Ma,
I am dead". Why do they call even after they become old?
Because, it is ingrained in him that mother always offer
protection. He has observed it under many occasions. Why does
a child cry? Everybody cries. It is a language. Crying is a
universal language. Mother understands this language. When he
feels hunger, he says it with a cry. Mother recognizes this.
Occasionally, infants who cannot sit, if laid for a long time, they
cry meaning that they are tired lying in that position. Plead their
mother to lift them up. Mother understands this cry and lifts the
child. Even if they are hungry, they will cry. He communicates
with the cry. Even if an insect bites, they will cry. Even if they
are exposed to dangerous thing, they will cry. They know their
mother. Even if some other women lift, they can realize that she
is not their mother. By touch, they can make out that she is their
mother; what an awareness! There was a Bengali soldier in
Ladhak. In an unconscious state, he was calling "Mago". I have
enquired with another soldier," What is he saying"? I was


68 Sahib Bandgi
informed that he was crying out for his mother. If you call out to
the lord, with faith even in other awastas, it will reach him. If
Guru is competent, even in your dream state if you call, he will
come and save you. Similarly, he can save from Yama also.
_Aant Kaal Jab Jiv Ko Aay| Kaalhi Jith Hans Le Jaay||_
A boy told me that he is afraid because earlier there were
only few disciple of me, but now there are many, so we do not
even get time to talk. I think if I die, you will not come to know
and therefore Kal will take me. I explained to him that if the
child is small, mother feeds him with her own hand. She takes
her attention. If the child is in a position to crawl then, while
doing her normal duty, she keeps an eye on the child. If the
child moves in the dangerous direction, she saves it. Even if she
does not know, when she hears the cry, she runs quickly to
protect. Similarly, Guru also responds. All these can happen
only if complete faith is there. Then, at the end, he will call out
his Guru only. Therefore:
_Guru Se Surti Rakh Rah Jodi| Jaas Natva Rakhat Hey Dori||_
If The Pray Emanates From The Inner Sense, It Reaches
Guru. It is known as faith and it is belief in Guru. He arrives.
Disciple is required to cling to the Naam. Sahibji says:
_Gahey Naam Vishwas, Tapar Yum Na Pavahi||_
What is this Faith? In Ranjidi, I do observe that some
women complain about disturbance of Spirits. I know that any
external spirits cannot affect my Namis. If my Naami does
bhajan sitting with a non- Naami, no spirit can come there. If
this is the case, Naamis cannot be touched. That is why; the
secret of Satya Bhakti should be understood. What is Bhakti?
That is why; at the end I always say that if you have devotion,
be devoted or else, keep the faith.
You should understand your beliefs clearly. How the Naam
should clung? An ordinary Jiva (being) will be jolted. I
remembered an incident. A woman came and complained of
Headache. I asked her to do bhajan. She replied she does bhajan
and arti also and said, she lights the lamp of Mata also.
What is this? It means, she has not understood the meaning
of devotion properly. Some parents brought a boy with a mental
illness to me. They told, "He was alright when he took Naam
from you then again the boy developed problem". I enquired


The Real Disciple 69
with the boy. He told me, "It is your grace, I am fine. They
behave like this. Sometimes they take me to Tantriks and
sometimes they lock me up". He did not like that. The boy said,
"I have complete faith but my parents do not accept".
See, how crooked are they! Do not do this. This shows lack
of faith.
This is the world of Kalpurush. He does not want the
devotion to Sahibji to progress or expand. All that panths which
exist now, directly or indirectly advocate Bhakti of Kalpurush.
It is only we, we do not.
Parampurush knows that the jivas cannot attain Satlok
without faith. Therefore, he will help to inculcate faith. You do
not worry. You do not realize what all you have received
through Naamdiksha. However, you are aware; there is a power,
which is guiding you after Naamdaan.
_Apne Dil Sey Janiye, Mere Dil Ki Baat||_
Do not be anxious. Sahibji will infuse faith. Do not become
desperate and lose faith. This is the base of devotion.
There was a Naami. His daughter was sick. Her father-in-
law said, "It is ok with Sahibji. However take her to the
Tantrik". The Naami replied, "It is alright if she dies. I will light
her funeral fire but I am not prepared to take her to Tantrik, at
least her spirit will not be haunted. She will attain Mukti". This
is the sign of true faith. It is true that Kalpurush cannot harm
your Atma. Sahibji asks to keep faith on the Naam.
_Ek Naam Ko Jaan Kar, Duja Dey Bahay||_
Disciple should understand that whatever condition in which
Satguru keeps him is the best for him. A devotee asked Sahibji,
"I have got your nearness. Kindly show me in what all ways, I
was observing devotion on you". Sahib began to show him. He
saw that Sahib was with him and he could even see the feet of
Sahibji. He could see the feet of two persons but he could
observe only one pair of leg in times of trouble and difficulties.
He told Sahibji that when I was in difficulties, you left me
alone. Sahibji said, "You ignorant fellow, whenever you are in
difficulties, I took you on my shoulders therefore those legs
were of mine, not yours. You were not walking".
_Ta Dukh Ko So Bandgi, Prabhu Ki Lavey Yaad|
Ta Sukh Lavey Sirr Parey, Sahib Det Bhulat||_


70 Sahib Bandgi
Do you know that one day in a year; I have to be under the
sunlight for the whole day without even shades. One day in a
year, I have to be open in the rain; I cannot cover my head even.
One day I have to spend in a cold without even a Blanket.
However, I may try, it must happen. One day at a satsang in
Satwari (Jammu), rain started. Those who gathered also
drenched. First, I thought of stopping it but I realized that in the
rain I did not get wet. Rainy season was going to over so this
was the day, so I let it rain. One day, I was caught in a traffic
jam and it was a very hot day. The traffic jam did not ease and I
did not like to come out in the hot sun. We were told that traffic
would not move at least for three to four hours. Therefore, I
came out of the car and began to walk in the hot Sun because I
was to give a Satsang at a place. I realized that the traffic jam
was meant to make me walk in the hot sun and it was the day of
being in hot Sun.
Even if everything is all right with you, yet you will die. If
you will not be in anxiety, the senses will die. Little bit of
tension is needed. Therefore, you have to accept and move on.
You may have to face extreme insult. Therefore:
_Na Sukh Haal Mey Maza Hey, Na Dukh Haal Mey Maza Hey|
Jis Haal Mey Tu Rakhey, Uss Haal Mey Maza Hey||
Jivan Ka Humney Sopp Diya, Sab Bhar Tumharey Hatho Mey|
HeyJittTumhareyHaathoMey,HeyHaarTumharey Haatho Mey||_
Disciple does not want any worry from the world. Let
the whole world be angry and go against you but do not
turn away from your Satguru.
_Naam Piv Ka Chhadi Key, Karey Aan Ki Aas|
Veshya Tera Putra, Kahey Koun Ko Baap||_
If your wife leaves you angrily, it is all right. If she
goes to her mother's home for 1 month, 2 months or
6months and does not return, it does not matter but if she
get into another relationship then what happens. Then the
husband gives up, he will not seek any message even.
Same thing happens in the surrender.
_Sukh Mey Tujey Na Bhulu, Dukh Mey Na Haar Manu|
Aisa Prabhav Bhar De, Merey Adhir Maan Mey||_


The Real Disciple 71
Pain or pleasure, whatever it may be, do not bother. A
woman was instrumental in giving naam to 150 people in
Chennor (Jammu). She had her own school also. She is
very keen to bring other people in bhakti of Sahib. One day
she came with a worry. We also indulge in their agony. She
said that there is a peepal tree near the school. Somebody
spreading a rumor that there is a witch near the tree and she
was eating a liver of a child. Next day, not even fifty
children attended the school. The reason is very clear. The
older women immediately belive & trust. Whatever people
say, they are simply accepting it. If somebody comes with
a mace, they will say that Hanumanji has come because
they are very straightforward, they did not even see the
face of school. People did not send their children and
requested her to seek the help of Tantrik to get rid of the
witch. The woman had two sons: only one of them was
Naami. One of the sons told her to pray to the dead
ancestor. I explained to him that in our problem, if a tantrik
(sayane) gets engaged, then all the work will be spoiled. I
have taken many people into our devotion and if we use
tantriks, it will send a wrong message to others. I (Sahibji)
asked that woman to bring the boy to me. I told the boy to
go to every house and make them understand. He said,
"You are telling the truth but the worldly people are not
willing to accept. He had gone to every house and
explained to them but still 50 to 60 children did not turn up
to attend the school".
How is this world? If a Naami falls sick, they say that
Sahibji has not cured him and if he dies what to say of
him? The King Dasharath, out of grief for his sons who left
for forest, cried till he became blind. Nobody could save
him from the Kalpurush. If our Naami suffers from fever,
people say that too is because of his association with Sahib
Bandgi.


72 Sahib Bandgi
I have asked you to concentrate on one point, keep
centered on Sahib. You will face difficulties and
impediments however, keep your faith in Sahib.
_Rahiman Dhaga Prem Ka, Mat Todo Chatkay|
Tuteey Te Phir Na Judey, Judey Gaath Pad Jaay||
The World Can Rob You Off Still Hold On To Sahib.

A man said that he is afraid of me. There is no need to
tell you anything. Automatic it comes out of your
mouth.We have another type of computer. We are not
asking you to do meritorious deeds. I ask you to preserve
safely that which is given to you.
Even your own family members,the neighbors can also
attack you. They want you to join them and stoop down to
their level. They will never tell that you have become
good. On the contrary, they will accuse that you have given
up worshipping deities. The accusation is a very crooked
one. They themselves will be drunken, flesh eaters and
thieves. They will not be a devotee. Now-a-days, majority
are drunkards. They wanted to pull down good people. In
olden days, if there was a drunkard in a village, people
used to look down upon him with rejection. If there was a
thief, people used to insult them. Now the thieves also
multiplied. Earlier, if anyone irritates a woman, people
used to spit on them. Now their number also increased.
World is going in a reverse manner so do not get
despondent.
Once I had gone to Ruplal's House where 3-4 people,
by sitting in their vehicle, began to spit on my vehicle. This
went on for half an hour but they did not have courage to
come out of their vehicle. Can good people commit such an
act? I enquired with Ruplal as to who they are. He replied
they are the tantriks who took lakhs of rupees from me
earlier but after coming to you, I became all right. I
brought others also to you.
Do you understand,what was a difficulty of tantrik.


The Real Disciple 73
Only I opposes hypocracy.Hypocrites are angry with
me. Evil spirit cannot do anything to a Naami so the
Tantriks are afraid. Even if a very low person aproaches,
they collect big crowd, they wanted to ensure that Sahibji's
fame would not spread. I have not cheated anyone but there
are people who are very vulgar, spread lies and cruel.
There is lot of impediments in reaching me, which you will
never find elsewhere because I spared lot of hypocrites. In
future, they will disappear all together, now, they are half-
dead. These days, they have taken oath from other not to
enter Sahib bandgi organisation. We transformed
individuals into a better human and taught them how to
live their life. There is no need to worry, there is a great
strength in the devotion of Sahib. This power is very
unique so keep your faith:
_Mujhey Hai Kaam Satguru Se, Duniya Ruthey To Ruthan Dey||_
The essential truth lies in the surrender of disciple at the
feet of Satguru. The ways of Sant is Sahaj Marg and it is
on the principle of surrender to Satguru. Sahib says, you
need not to do any Sadhana, Sadguru will liberate you.
In the Yog-marg (Path of action), there is importance to
observance of Yog- sadhana, it does not depend on the
grace of Guru. In the Gyaana marg (Path of wisdom), the
importance is attached to the wisdom but not to the Guru.
In the Bhakti marg (Path of devotion), the importance is
given for Bhakti, not for the grace of Guru. However in the
Sant marg (Path of Sanths or Sahaj marg), the importance
is given to grace of Satguru ('Moksha moolam, Guru
Kripa'). In this path, Disciple surrenders to Satguru, and
lives and attains liberation by his grace. All the work is
accomplished by his grace. Sahibji says:
_Teen Lok Nav Khand Mey, Guru Se Bada Na Koi|
Karta Kare Na Kar Sake, Guru Kare So Hoi||_
Satguru will do all that is needed. Sahibji's words bring
out this truth to establish Gurutva.
_Kabir Hari Key Ruthatey, Guru Ki Sharani Jaay|
Kahe Kabir Guru Ruthatey, Prabhu Nahi Hoth Sahay||_


74 Sahib Bandgi
_Kabir Tey Nar Andh Hey, Guru Ko Kahatey Aaur|
Hari Ruthey Guru Thaur Hey, Guru Ruhtey Nahi Thaur||_
Do you find such a statement anywhere else! Such
importances were never given to Guru. If you move to the
era of yog, there were fights and battles between Guru and
his Disciple but the path of Sants says:
_Guru Gungey Guru Bavarey, Guru Key Rahiye Daas|
Jo Guru Bhejey Narak Mey, To Rakhiye Swarg Ki Aas||_
...Therefore the importance of surrender. Surrender is
supreme. From whomevers protection you seek, they
definately protect. Vibhishan took to the feet of Rama. In
the battlefield, when Ravan sent a powerful arrow at
vibhishan, Ramchandra came in the front and took it on
himself. If you surrender to the feet of Satguru, he will
protect you with his power. Then, you need not to put up a
strruggle to save yourself.
_Jo Satguru Ki Sharan Ho Taki|Tehi Kuchh Yatan Rahey Nahi
Baaki||
Tatey Sharanagat Sab Parhey|Sharan Gahey Tey Jiv Ubarey||_
After surrendering, if he is struggling with his own
effort, it means, he is yet to surrender. Surrender itself is a
form of higher level of devotion. In surrender to your
Satguru, all strength and wisdoms can be achieved
automatically; all the accumulated sins will be destroyed.
Sharanagati is a supreme sadhana.
_Sharanagat Kah Sab Gunn Aavey|Gyan Bhakti Tehi Mahi

Satguru will accomplish all his work, those who
surrender to the Satguru. A mahatma spoke on this in a
satsang. There was a person in the satsang. He asked the
Mahatma, "What if we dont eat, will the lord will feed us"?
Mahatma said, "Yes, he will feed you". He gave up taking
food from that day, wanting to see how the lord will feed
him. He did not take food the whole day. Seated in his


The Real Disciple 75
wife, lord tried to feed him with love. He was stubborn and
refused to take food from his wife. The next day, he was
very hungry, he could smell the food and the thought arise
in the mind to take food. He ignored his idea thinking that
it is the play of mind and resolved to see as to how the lord
will feed him. Therefore, he moved to a Jungle(forest).
There was a village nearby and a marrige was in progress.
They have prepared lot many food items. They observed a
man sitting in the Jungle so they wanted to feed him also.
So two of them brought food for him and told him to eat.
This was an act of lord. He was still very stubborn, he
turned them back saying that he is not feeling hungry. They
told him, "Brother, you are sitting here since morning
without food so please take this food". However, he told
them that he was not hungry. Thinking that when he is
hungry, he will take the food, they kept the food under a
tree close by him and went back to village. An urge came
to him to pertake the food. Therefore, to resist the
influence,he kept the food under another tree. By destiny,
two theives were on their way at midnight after their work.
They sat nearby and were accounting their loot. In the
mean time, they had a desire to have food. They sat down
to take their food, which the villagers have brought earlier.
Lord prompted one of them. He asked the other thief to
stop eating and told him that the food may contain poison,
it is possible that someone might have kept it. The other
thief also said that it is possible and let us search for the
person. They saw a person seated under a tree. They
doubted him and caught hold of him and brought him to
the place where food was kept and told him, "you are very
clever. Giving us poisoned food, you have planned to steal
our possessions". He replied, "It is not correct, I do not
know anything. I have not added any poison". One among
the thief said, "Then you eat a Sweet laddu". He replied
that he does not want to eat laddu. The other theif said,
"There is something mischevious in this". He gave him two


76 Sahib Bandgi
three blows and stuffed his mouth with a laddu to eat. So
the first theif asked him to feed Puri also. He refused to
take puri. They rained again 5-6 blow on him and asked
him to eat the puri. In the same way, Halwa and other
sweets have been fed to him. All the food were given to
him.
The next day, the person came to the Mahatma and fell
at his feet and said, "It is true, lord whenever he wishes, he
will feed us. Even if we dont like, still he will feed us.
At first, he tries to feed you with love and later by
pleading or even beating, he will feed you. This can
happen only when we have faith and belief in him but if we
are crooked or wicked, it will not happen. Therefore,
surrender from your heart truely to your Satguru. Let me
show you what is Sharanagati.

has these qualities, will attain salvation in a moment.

them without fail in Day-to Day life. Do not ignore any of

them. If you were told, do not eat non-vegetarian food,then

do not take them. If you are asked not to gamble,then you

should not indulge in them. If you do not follow, it will

have ill effect on your intellect, it will become dull. Where

is the need to be wickedness, crookedness and stealing? If

you get only one meal a day, spend the day with it and be

happy, even forgetfully do not steal. Don't go against any

of these rules. This constitutes the high level of devotion.

This is the first step for surrender.

##### Love and service for Satguru:

It means, serve Satguru with Tan, Maan and Dhan
(Body, Mind and Wealth). At the time of Naamdan
(initiation), I asked you for your Tan, Maan and Dhan but
not just like that; I asked you to give me with your eyes
closed and from your heart truely. You said- yes, given.
Gorakhnath to whomso ever he initiated, he never returned
their body-Tan, he was feeding them the sugarcane but, I
did not do that to you. I have returned the body to you back
and told you to keep it protected in trust. Further, not to use
it in any bad activity. I returned you it to you because you
may have to serve elders in your family but if the need
arises, I can recall you. Whenever he finds time, the
disciple should come to the Ashram to serve, as per his
capabilities. If you put your body to service, it will be free
from disease. I have returned back the wealth to you
because, you may need it for the maintenance of your
home. Therefore, you keep it. However, do not misuse it
for wrong purpose, do not accuse anyone wrongly. As per
the scriptures, a disciple is expected to spend 10 percent of
his earning, in service of his Guru but I did not ask you for
this because if you are unable to give it amounts to
breaching the word of Guru. For this reason, I have not
bound you with my word. Then the third is your Mind. I


78 Sahib Bandgi
have not returned this to you. I have asked you to keep it
with me.
Why did I do that because the mind is the cause of
bondage (relations and positions) and the world (Mano
mulam idam jagatu||), due to which mind proclaims
ownership, Mine and thyne, etc. when the Mind is under
Satguru, how can you claim ownership! Therefore, do not
expect any price from real Gurus. Ignoring their word, do
not follow your vimps.
_Guru Ki Baat Man Sab Lijey| Satya Asatya Vichar Na Kijey||_
Do not discriminate on what Guru says, whether it is
true or not. Whatever he has told, follow it; carry out
without modifications. Never avoid instruction of Guru in
life. Do not display your ego in front of your Guru,even if
you feel that you are right, follow only Gurus word.
Gurus seva brings success.
In this human birth, you have an opportunity for
service, use it to serve Satguru. You have to squeez and
extract service through this body.
_Aakhir Yaha Tan Khak Milega..._
You have to join in service. Not all other activities will
be useful. Even if you work day and night in the field or
labour, it is of no use. However, the service rendered to
your Satguru, will be helpful.
If a disciple does not serve a Guru, it is an offence.
_Nanak Jo Guru Sevey Apna , Hoi Tis Balihari Jaau||_
Guru seva is supreme. Sahibji says-
_Guru Sevey Katey Dukh Papa| Janam Janam Ko Mitey Santapa||
Guru Ki Seva Sada Chitt Dijey| Jivan Janam Suphal Kari Lijey||
Chaubis Rup Hari Aapuhi Dhariya| Guru Seva Kari Sabhi

Sakal Muni Guru Seva Chahi| Guru Seva Kari Panth Aavgahi||
Guru Ki Seva Mukti Nij Pavey| Bahuri Na Hans Bhavjaal Aavey||_
There is greatness attached to the service of Guru. Even
great Rishies have served their Gurus.Hari has also took
incarnation and engaged this mind to service his Guru.


The Real Disciple 79
Having taken a human birth, if he has not taken initiation
from Guru, his life is waste but the one who has born as
human and did not serve his Guru after initiation, he is
ignorant and foolish.
_Yog Daan Jaap Tirth Nahana| Guru Seva Binu Nishfal Jana||

Guru Seva Binu Dwand Andhera|Guru Seva Binu Kaal Ko Chera||
Guru Seva Binu Prem Vihuna| Din Din Moh Hoy Bhram Duna||_
Sahib says that without service to Guru, Yog, Jap, Tap
and Tirth are all useless. If you have not served a Guru,
you will be entangled in the world. Without service to
Guru, you wisdom will not shine. With Guru seva your
heart will be illumined. The one who lacks inner urge to
serve his Satguru, he will lack in love of Guru.
The disciple should have no ego while serving his
Guru. If that happens the seva becomes useless. Always
stay closer to Guru to bath in his grace.

Looking at the humility of disciple, Guru will be very
pleased. When Guru is pleased, say whatever you want.
The greatness of Guru seva, cannot be compared to any
other. Sahib says-
_Naamvant Bahutey Miley, Gyaanvant Anek|
Kahe Kabir Dharamdaas Se, Guruvanta Koi Ek||_
In service to the Guru, you will be the receipient of all
fruits and comforts. Sahib says-
_Ganga Yamuna Badrish Sametey|Jagannathadi DhaamHey Tetey||

Sahibji says pilgrimage to Ganga, Yamuna, Badrinath
and Jagan nath will not yield that fruit which you get by
doing service to Satguru.

It means keep your faith, whether I do anything or not.
Have firm faith that Guru will release you from Sansar
Sagar. This faith is important and supreme. Nobody
surrender his self, but you have given it to me. You had the
belief and faith. During Naamdan, I asked you for your
faith. What is faith? Faith in means that my Guru will
never tell lie. Faith is-
Guru Ko Akhand Brahma Kar Janey| Guru Ko Nahi Manush
Kar Maney||
Yah Nishachay Maan Maahi|Guru Taji Mor Sahayak Naahi||
```
##### Satguru has supreme powers. Do not seek elsewhere.

```
Keep complete faith in Satguru. Do not go elsewhere
searching for solution. Believe that there is no one else
other than Satguru who will be of real help. After you find
a true Satguru, where is the need to seek support
elsewhere? Do not do that. Dont keep your feet in two
boats. If you have achived Satguru who has supreme
power,you will get everything from him. If not then also,

The Real Disciple 81
be under command of Satguru.Whatever may be the
difficulties, think only this.
_Duniya Key Lakha Saharey, Mera Sahara Tu Hey||_
You should not run to a Tantrik or an Astrologer when
you face problems.
_Guru Sharanagati Chhadhi Kari, Karey Bharosa Aur|
Sukh Sampatti Ki Kah Chali, Nahi Narak Mey Thaur||_
Surrender truely.
_Ek Aas Vishwas Tumhari| Pada Dwaar Sab Vidhi Mey Haari||_
Understand the meaning of Faith correctly. Disbelief
will shatter you.
I remembered an example. A woman came and said:
Woman: I have headach.
I: Do Bhajan.
Woman: I do Bhajan, Arti and also lighting the lamp
for Mata di.
What is this? It means, she has not understood the
meaning of devotion properly. His parents brought a boy
with a mental illness to me. They told, "He was alright
when he took Naam from you then again the boy
developed problem". I enquired with the boy. He told me,
"It is your grace, I am fine. They behave like this.
Sometimes they take me to Tantriks and sometimes they
lock me up". He did not like that. The boy said, "I have
complete faith but my parents do not accept".
Therefore, see how crooked are they! Do not do this.
This shows lack of faith.
_Sadguru Murti Ko Dhyana|Taake Sanmukh Vinati Thana||_

##### Keep your rememberance of Satguru in your Thought,

##### Word and Deed.

It means all the time meditate on Satguru ('Dhyaan
Moolam,Guru Roopam'). Thought should be:
_Mo Sam Patit Na Katahu Nihara| Guru Sam Aur Na Taranhara|_


82 Sahib Bandgi
Do not show your thoughts (Guna) in front of Guru.
Show your natural tendencies(weaknesses). He is
compassionate, he will correct them.
_Mey Kaami Mey Kutlu, Mey Avgunn Ki Khan|
Mo Par Kripa Na Chhadiye, Daas Aapno Jaan||
Avgunn Kiye To Bahu Kiye, Karat Na Mani Haar|
Bhavey Banda Baksh De, Bhavey Gardan Maar||
Satguru Dinn Dayal Ji, Tum Lag Meri Daud|
Jaise Kaag Jahaj Par, Suzat Katahu Na Thaur||_
From this, you understand that you (without
Satguru)are not capable. If you boost yourself, nothing will
remain with you. Sahibji says:
_Satguru Ki Maryada Na Dharai|
Lakh Chaurasi Kund Mey Parai||
Guru Ko Shabd Na Suney Agyani|
Bhavsagar Dubey Abhimani||_
Sahibji says you should always be respectful and
obedient to Satguru. Those who indulge in disrespect will
take birth in 84 lakhs of jivas.
_Guru Ko Dekhi Dharat Abhimana| Vyas Bachan Pad
Naraknidhana||_
Who shows his ego in front of Guru,will directly go to
hell
_Guru ko Gyaan Meti Thapi|Teen Lok Me Bado Te Paapi||
Guru ko Meti Bakhanat Aapa|Dharati Bhar Marat Tehi Paapa|
Guru Se Uncha Chadhi Baithey|Saat Kund Narak Me Paithey||_
The one who displays his knowledge in front of Guru,
he is considered the big sinner in all the three worlds. Even
the earth cannot bear his weight. He is the one who tries to
take higher place than his Guru does. The one who does
this, he falls into the Kumbi hell.
_Guru Sey Ulta Bachan Sunavey| Saat Janam Kodhi Ko Pavey||
Guru Ko Ulat Sunavey Baina| Saat Janam Andha Hoy So

The one who argues with his Guru and replies
arrogantly, his body will suffer Leprosy or he will remain
blind for seven lives.
Always speak pleasantly in front of Satguru.

##### Surrender with complete Faith.

It means, surrender yourself to Satguru. Unload your
entire burden on Sahib with faith. Take it to your Heart.
_Jivan Ka Sab Sopp Diya Ab, Bhar Tumharey Hatho Mey|
Hey Jeet Tumhare Hatho Mey, Hey Haar Tumharey Hatho Mey||_
Surrender is greater than meditation and Bhajan. If you
have faith, you receive greater benifits. I will give you an
example. A man took Naamdaan. He was innocent. After
some time, he returned. He said, "Sahib, from the time I
have taken Naamdaan, I am very happy". You asked for
surrender of Tann, Mann and Dhan with eyes closed. I
thought what is this? Am I to give it truely?, but I have
given you. I thought even my house belongs to you. Guruji
I have a small shop. I open the shop in remembering you.
You keep standing for 24 hours with me and get the all
work done. In reality, you are running the shop. If there is a
condition for loss, you take the direct action. Nothing
happens by me. It is only you and you yourself. My wife
and children belong to you. I think that I am only a servant
whom instead of keeping in the Ashram, entrusted the job
of looking after the house. All my pride is lost. He spoke a
lot with humility. He said, Guruji, I tell you, sometimes in
the night you appear and take me around. See how
innocent he was! He has surrendered himself in real. That
is why; Sahib has to do all his work.
In the earning of spiritual wisdom , can we be a part? What
should we do? What Sahib says has merit. He gives the example


84 Sahib Bandgi
of Bhrunga (an insect). It takes any Larva and with his sound
makes a Larva into another Bhrunga but there is a one condition
here.
_Bhrungi Shabd Kit Jo Mana| Varan Pher Aapan Kar Jana||
Koi Koi Kit Param Sukhdai| Pratam Awaz Gahey Chittlai||
Koi Dujey Koi Tije Maney|Tan Maan Rahit Shabd Hit Janey||
Bhrungi Shabd Kit Na Gahai| Tou Puni Kit Aasar Rahai||_
Some Larve catches the sound in its very first attempt, some
on the second or third time. There are some Larves which does
not succeed. It listens to the sound but gets frightened, becomes
uncomfortable. Just like when mother takes children to
Mahapurushas for salutation (Bandgi). The child cries, they
think that he may be a doctor who will give a injection because
of his earlier visit to a doctor. Similarly, the Larva gets
frightened for the fear of being eaten. But Bhrunga is larve’s
well-wisher, it gives pleasures.
Guru shabd nischay satya maaney, bhrungi maat tab pavai|
_Taji Sakal Aasa Shabd Basa, Kaga Hans Kahavai||_
Therefore, Guru's words gives comfort. Bhrunga vibrates
with the sound of Bhu- Bhu. Some Larvas does not respond to
the very first sound. Why, because he does not surrender itself.
Until it surrenders, it does not transform. Bhrunga gives up after
the third attempt. It goes on search for another Larve.
_Toh Puni Kit Aasrey Rahai..._
Then it cannot transform into a Bhrunga, it remains to be an
ordinary insect. Swami Paramanand says with sweetness-
_Bhrungi Jo Aan Kit Ko Khud Rang Lagavey|
Awaz Apni Aansikh Kaan Sikhavey||
Vaha Rup Pahala Raha Ek Na Baaki|
Guru Shabd Se Philphor Rang Palat So Javey||
Koi Aur Kism Karm Ko Jindaar Na Dekhey|
Bhrungi Jo Apney Dhang Kit Dhund Key Lavey||
Vah Dhundh Kaam Apney Hi Hum Rang Humesha|
Dil Dey Key Usko Tabhi Apne Rup Banavey||
Dil Usko Dena Chahiye Dildaar Koi Ho|
Hindu Ya Musalman Kharidar Koi Ho||
Hey Kit Lakh Sadmey Koi Ek Hi Mera|
Jaha Jakey Bar Bar Bhrung Karta Hey Phera||
Vahi Kit Jehal Apne Se Gurubaat Na Maney|_


The Real Disciple 85
_Tab Jakey Paas Uske Bhrung Karta Hey Dera||
Kahata Hey Kit Tumko Lagi Aan Kharabi|
Nahi Akla Thikane Rahi Nahi Ilam Hey Tera||
Tu Baat Meri Maan Abki Baar Kaan Dhar|
Ho Meri Tu Humshakla Tera Hovey Nibtera||
Dil Usko Dena Chahiye Dildaar Koi Ho|
Hindu Ya Musalman Kharidar Koi Ho||_
Among lakhs of Larvae, only rare Larva qualifies for whom
Bhrunga tries repeatedly to transform that Larvae to Bhrunga.
Bhrunga gives his heart and makes it like himself. So it is said
that you have to offer your to one who deserves it as the
requisite merit.
This way, it requires surrender. A thought may arise in mind
as to why it is necessary. In reality, all the three (Body, Mind
and Wealth) are cause for bondage. Atma takes that wealth is
needed for which it performs many actions (Karmas). Why
Guru ask for Body, Mind & Wealth. Because Atma takes itself
as Body.As Atma accept that he is a body,at that moment it has
become an error and started working for bodily sustainance.
_Jabtey Jiv Bhayo Sansari| Chhutey Na Granthi Na Hoy
Sukhari||_
Then it takes wealth as its own, it struggles to earn it be it
fair or foul. It struggles very hard. This way mind pervades the
entire universe and becomes the cause of bondage.
Guru have taken all these three.What is the significance of
these three? If Guru takes your Body, firstly illusion (confusion)
gets over that I am a body. If Guru takes your Wealth it ends
your greed. What is mind? It is the Intellect, memory and ego
(action). Do not involve in this. Why is it, so? Whatever you
accomplish with mind, it will be fraudulent and that we
accomplish with memory (chitt) and ego; will end in
destruction. All these four aspects of mind create illusion.
Therefore, you are required to surrender. Only then, you will
accept the words of Satguru. Whatever he says, welcome that.
Whoever who meets the above six condition can transend in
a moment. He needs to do nothing else. When a child is very
small and under the care of mother, mother gives lot of
attention. She feeds the child with her own hand, put to sleep.
She does all the work. However when the same child grows,


86 Sahib Bandgi
then she keeps only a little attention. She prepares the food,
keeps in front of child, and does not feed him. Similarly, till the
time, a person is in the state of surrender, Satguru keeps all his
attention. Satguru does not keep his attention that much on the
disciple with wisdom (Gyaani). Therefore, you should always
keep a low profile and surrender to him so that he can take good
care of us and we can attain our goal easily.

Satguru has the Paras Surati of Supreme Lord. (Supreme
Lord’s concentration) and true bodiless 'Saar Naam/Word’
(Sajeevan Naam- Alive Holy Name). ‘Saar Naam’ is a
Soundless sound and not any Naam related to world or
religions, Saar Naam cannot be written or spoken, which
directly transforms the crow like nature (evil mind ruling
over soul) of a disciple into the nature of a Hansa (soul
ruling over evil mind) which further leads to permanent
salvation.

#### 2. Shabd (Soundless Sound).

##### Acceptance of Shabda Initiation

##### (Man tu maan shabd updesha)

Kahe Kabir Yaha Taat Jo Buzey, Maney Sikh Humari|

Remembering the Naam given by Satguru, always pay
attention to his sayings. Giving up fun and frolicks, humbly
engage in devotion to Satguru. Keep faith in the Naam.
With restrain and dettachment, adhere to the words of
Satguru. Then Kaal will not be able to do any harm.

##### Unique path of Love

Satguru.

```

88 Sahib Bandgi
The one who lacks of love for his Guru, leads his life
like an animal and his existance becomes fruitless. It is like
taking poison instead of nectar. His birth becomes a curse.
Those who are engaged in tirth Yatras etc, has to repent at
the end for not seeking Satguru.

##### Be in the rememberance of Naam

##### (Hansa mat bichhudo sumiran se)

_Hansa mat bichhudo sumiran se||

Kahe kabir suno bhai sadho, magan rahe tan man se||_
Engage in the rememberance of Gurus Naam with your
body and mind. Such a disciple does not return to this
worldly ocean of life again.

##### Greatness of Guruship

_Hansa Aiso Gurumat Bhari|

A disciple who truthfully accepts the word of his Guru
and lives by that, he becomes unique in this world. Even
Yama cannot cause any harm to him. He gets libration. He
is always desirous of Gurus darshan. He becomes as a
Sadhu. He would not be stuck with lower forms of unreal
devotions. Such a disciple, serving his Satguru, soaks in
the bliss of ocean of nectar.

Where will the pilgrimage of jiva take? Under the
rulership of Mind, the King; which is the seat of Lust,
Desire, Jealousy, Anger, Pride, etc. there flows a river of
doubts with the waves of sensual desires. All these has
nothing to do with the Jiva-Hans. Oh, Jiva seek a Satguru.
Without him, you will be lost. Out of his compassion, he
will carry you along. Humbly takes shelter under his
compassionate protection. If you do not, you will be tosed
up and down in this worldly ocean (Sansar) of pain and
pleasure.

Satguru Kabir Sahib has commented on four Varnas
(caste). Brahmin is one who is aware of Brahma. Sadhu is
one who is an embodiment of forgiveness, compassion,
sacrifice and several hundreds of such good qualities.
Kshatriya is one who destroys sins with the sword of


90 Sahib Bandgi
wisdom (Gyan); with the compassionate heart, he will not
deviate from the above. Vaishya is one who sacrifices his
sensual pleasure, desist from other's women; destroying the
pride, baths in Atmagyan (Spiritual wisdom). Shudra is one
who leads the simple life without hurting anybody and
bathing in the grace of Satguru attains the changeless state
of eternity. Those jivas, who with discrimination adores
Satguru, escapes this Sansar.Here, no question of any
victory or defeat of any caste.Sahibji says,bhakti of
Satguru is supreme of all.

The Real Disciple 91
A Shisya who denounces his Guru, he stays in the hell
for thousands of Kalpas. Those who listens to the hatred
words on his Guru, he becomes a Demon (Rakshas) or he
will be born in the womb of dog. Thosewho argues with
his Guru, he is a foolish person. He will die as an ignorant
person and takes birth as a demon in the forest. Those who
give up their Guru and worship others; he will become
poor and lives in misery. Do not stay without the darshan
of Satguru. Make a fix schedule for darshan, reaching there
offer as much service as practical. If you can not give the
service there is no harm but do not go with the empty hand.
If you do not have anything, offer a leaf or flower. With
the humility of the poor man, approach Guru and speak to
him. Do not stretch the leg in front of Guru while seated.
Sit cross-legged. You should not even step on his shadow.
Do not hide truth, do not display your clever or
crookedness in front of your Guru. Taking Guru as the very
Parampurush himself and follow his words as Mantras
(Mantra Moolam Guru Vakyam||). Whatever precious thing
you get, offer that to Guru. Guru is compassionate,
whatever offered at his feet, returned to you thousands
fold. Formally, Pooja should be done only to Guru (Pooja
Moolam, Guru Padakam). With Guru Pooja, nothing is left
and done, all sins will be destroyed, and all wishes are
fullfiled. Offering food to Guru amounts to offering to the
entire universe.

##### Get rid of Pride and Ego

```
Shish Utare Hath Se Sahaj Aasiki Nahi||
Sahaj Aashiki Nahi Khand Khaney Ko Nahi|
Jhoot Ashiki Karey Muluk Mey Joothi Khayee||
Jitey Ji Mari Jai Karey Na Tann Ki Aasa|
Aasik Ko Din Raat Rahey Suli Par Basa||
Maan Badai Khoy Nind Bhar Nahi Sona|
Til Bhar Rakth Na Maans Nahi Aasik Ko Rona||
Paltu Badey Bevkoof Vey Aasik Honey Jahi|
Shish Utare Hath Sey Sahaj Aasiki Nahi||
```

92 Sahib Bandgi
Paltu sahib says that to adore Satguru, Parampurush
with love is not an easy task like eating sugar. False
expression of love will yield false result. The one with the
true love, can die as a Jivanmukta (liberated while living),
he does not keep desire his bodily pleasure; he keeps
hanging by thread; he gives up the pride and sleep; there
won't be any evidence of fat in his body; still he is free
from worry. In a worldly way they appear foolish, the one
who is in the state of love cuts off his ego headedness and
throws it off.

##### Please the Sant Satguru

_Jag Khizey Toh Ka Bhaya Rizey Satguru Sant||
Rizey Satguru Sant Aas Kuchh Jag Ki Nahi|
Ek Dwaar Ko Chhod Aur Na Mangan Jahi||
Jiyu Mero Baru Jaai Janm Baru Jaai Nasaai|
Karo Na Dusar Aas Sant Ki Karo Duhaai||
Teen Lok Risiyay Sakal Sur Nar Aur Naari|
Mor Na Baanke Baar Pathanga Paya Bhari||
Paltu Sab Rovey Pada Mor Bhaya Salatant|
Jag Khizey Toh Ka Bhaya Rizey Satguru Sant||_
I do not worry if the whole world is angry with me,
because my Satguru is happy with me. I have no worldly
desire, leaving the door of Sant Satguru; I do not seek any
other door. Even if I have to give up my life, I will not give
up my Satguru or go elsewhere; I will pray only to my
Satguru. My hairs will not waver, if the Gods, Demi-gods
and people of the three worlds become angry with me. My
Satguru is supremely powerful. Everyone is internally
crying in their hearts but my heart has become cool, I have
nothing to do with anyone.

##### Follow the words of Guru

##### (Guru ki aagya mey hi rahiyo)

```
GuruKi Agya Drudh Kari Gahiye|GuruKi Agya Mey Hi
Rahiye||
Guru Agya Bin Kaaj Na Kijiye|Hani Hoi Toh Honey Dijiye||
```

_Guru Ki Agya Bighna Na Koi|Guru Ki Agya Gurumukh Hoi||

Charandas Guru Agya Puri|Bin Agya Karni Sab Kuri||
Agyakari Gurumukh Nikey|Sahajo Lok Bhog Sab Phike||_
Speaking about the identity of Guru Mukha, Sahajo bai
says to hold on to the words of Guru and follow them. Do
not do anything without his acceptance. Even if it means
suffering of losses, do not worry. If you follow the words
of Guru, you will not face difficulties. Those who follow
the words of Guru become Guru Mukh; devotion attains
fullness in following the words of Guru; only with the path
shown by the Guru, one attains liberation. Guru's words are
supreme. He, who follows the words of the Guru, is a true
servant of the lord; he who follows the words of the Guru,
is a Sadhu; one who follows the words of his Guru, realizes
the truth; those who ignores the words of Guru, takes birth
repeatedly from the womb and suffers in the world. Sahajo
bai says that she always carries out the words of her Guru
Charandaas, everything else is useless. The one who
follows the words of the Satguru, Guru Mukh; for him all
worldly things feel bitter.

##### Make effort to follow

##### (Apni aur nibhaiye)

```
Apni Aur Nibhaiye, Haari Parey Ki Jeeti||
Haari Parey Ki Jeeti Taahi Ki Laaj Na Kijey|

```

94 Sahib Bandgi
You should love your Satguru from your side. Without
worrying about whether you succeed or not. Never give up
even if you have to face a storm on the way, never retract.
Do not run even if you are hurt. Even if you fall, get up and
walk on. He is a heroic warrior who fights for his race and
people. The rest is in the hands of Satguru. He can do
anything. Be devoted to the Naam truely without worrying
about success or failure.

##### Comfort at the Holy feet of Guru

_Sukhi SabJivGurudevkiSaranHai,KalKa BaanTahaNahi Lagey|

Karam Aur Bharam Sab Doori Bhagey||
GyanvicharAurdhyanNirbhayrahe,RaindinDhyanGuruAur Nai|
Kahe Kabir Sukhsindhka zulna,ManAur PavankoPalat Mahi||_
A disciple who has taken shelter at the feet of Satguru
leads a comfortable life. The arrow of Kaam (Desires)
Krodh (Anger) etc does not affect him, they remain in the
rememberance of Naam all the time and stay away from
illusions of this world. They do meditation of Guru, day
and night.

##### Devotee without desire

_Das Kahai Ke Aas Na Kijiye|
Aas Jo Kare So Das Nahi|
Prem Toh Ek Jo Laga Sansar Mey|
Bhakti Gai Door Ab Jagat Mahi|
Chahiye Bhakti Ko Jakt Sey Toriye|
Joriye Jakt Sey Bhakti Jahi|
Das Paltu Kahey Ek Ko Chhodi De|
Tarvaar Dui Myaan Ik Nahi Chahi||_
Claiming to be the servant of Satguru, do not run after
desires. Those who do so are not servant of Satguru. Love
is one. If his attention is fixed on worldly things,
understand that he is devoted to the world only. A disciple
is expected to break freely from worldly desires and


The Real Disciple 95
develop devotion in the Satguru bhakti because he cannot
keep two swords in a single scabbard.

##### Remain physically Alert

##### (Aath pahar nirkhat rahey)

_Aath Pahar Nirkhat Rahey Jaisey Chand Chakor||
Jaisey Chand Chakor Palak Sey Tarat Nahi|
Chugey Birah Sey Aag Rahe Man Chandey Mahi||

Deepak Mey Jyo Patang Prem Se Praan Gavavey||
Paltu Esi Preet Kar Pardhan Chahey Chor|
Aath Pahar Nirkhat Rahey Jaisey Chand Chakor||_
Paltu sahib says you should be like chakor bird, which
does not take his eye of moon; he should always look to
Satguru. Chakor bird sometimes takes fire as radiance of
peace of firewood as a Moon and tries to take it with his
beak. He turns to keep his attention at the Moon all the
time. When the Moon is covered by the clouds then he tries
to pick up piece of burning Firewood. The bee loves lotus
flower intensely, gives up his life even but it will not leave
the Lotus; it is trapped into it. Just as the Moth gives up its
life into the flame and just like how a thief loves the
valuables of others, such should be a love towards Satguru.

##### Advance towards the Holy feet of Guru

##### (Satguru sharane jaay key)

```
Satguru sharaney jay key, tamas tyagiye|
Bhala bura kahi jaay, toh uthi nahi lagiye||
Uthi lagey so rar, rar maha nich hey|

_Neem na mitha hoy, sinchey gud ghiv so||

Kahahi kabir vichar, samuz man bhavana|
Hans gaye satlok, bahuri nahi aavna||_
Give up the tamasik tendencies (dull wickedness,
inertia) on at the feet of Satguru. If anyone insults, have
forbearance; do not get angry. If you given to anger, you
will end up in arguments of fight and being disciple of
Satguru, such behavior will demean you. Even if someone
shouts at you, do not respond. You have the nectar of
Satguru keep drinking. Whoever has this nectar, he does
not like argument and fight. Dog has a nature of biting the
bone. The tendencies peculiar to a person does not leave
him. Even if you rub any amount of Jaggery on the Neem,
it will not give up its bitter taste. Nothing happens when
you hold garland in the hand, when all the vices are with
you. Even if your nature appears generally good, even then
the flame of bad instincts still exists and it can surface any
time. Ignorance will not vanish; it will remain dormant at
times. Therefore, understand your mind and be alert. You
will reach the Amar lok in that state only, never to return.

##### Sing the Glory of Satguru

##### (Mey toh Satguru ka gunn gasiya)

_Rana Ji Mey Toh Satguru Ka Gun Gasiya||
Charanamrut Ka Nem Hamare, Nit Utt Darsan Jasiya||
Prem Mandir Mey Nirath Karasiya,Bhavsagar Tar Jasiya||
Yaha Sansar Baad Ka Kaata, Jyo Sangat Nahi Jasiya||

Singing the glory of Satguru, Meera bai says- "Oh
Ranaji! I will only sing the glory of Satguru. We are
required to take Charanamrut (Sacred water) of Satguru as
a custom. Therefore, I will wake up and go for his darshan


The Real Disciple 97
& take charanamrut every day. I will dance in the temple
of love and transcend this Sansar. This world is Strawn
with thorns in which devotees cannot engross. My Satguru
is the supreme lord, I shall sing his glory.

##### Who is related to Whom

(Kaun kisi ke naatey hai)
_Maal Jinhone Jama Kiya,Sauda Parihare Jatey Hai||

One who only accumulates money,without offering
in Guru seva, he is not serving others (Paro upkar). He has
failed to justify his own wealth. With money, he makes all
types of houses big and small. He makes an air-conditioned
room and takes rest there. Those who are in the forefront in
the morning, Kalpurush take them first in the evening. Oh,
travelers do not get immersed in the dirty and filthy stream
of the world. This is the business of betrayal of Maya.
Often this Maya traps. Here, brothers, relatives and family;
they all meet and live on deception. When Kalpurush
attacks, nobody will be with you,everybody keep away.
Who is a wife to whom, who is husband.Who belongs to
whom! Sahib says those who do not take shelter of Satguru
and offer salutation, Kalpurush eats them off.

##### Keep away from pretence

##### (Lok laaj nahi manihou)

```
Lok Laaj Nahi Maaniho Tan Maan Lajja Khoy||
Tan Man Lajja Khoy Chhodi Key Maan Badaai|

Paltu sahib says give up the sense of shame and rising
above body and mind, status, race, lineage, etc. and take
shelter at the feet of Satguru, serve him. Let anybody
laugh, do not be ostentatious. See Sahib (Supreme lord) in
both Hindus and Muslims. Giving up ostentations and
sounding the drum of wisdom, serve the Guru. Detaching
from illusion cut the knot of Kalpurush. Paltu sahib says to
remember the Naam of Satguru. Then whatever happens,
do not worry.

##### Compassionate People

##### (Jan ko dinta jab aavey)

_Jan Ko Dinta Jab Aavey||

When the humility manifests in Shishya, Satguru gives
him such a place with grace, which even Trinity Gods will
not get. Those who keeps others in esteem and takes a
secondary place becomes dear to Satguru. He sees one
Atma in all and giving up all the illusions, sings the glory
of Satguru. He sacrifices his pride and offers his Devotion
to Satguru. Forgetting his scholarship, Gyaan etc; he is
ever in remembrance of Satguru's Saar Naam. Such a


The Real Disciple 99
disciple receives the grace of Guru and crosses the
sansar,he never gets returned.

##### Mutual Attraction between us

_Tera mey didaar diwana|
Ghadi ghadi tuze dekha chahu, sunn sahib rahamana||
Hua aalmast khabar nahi tan ki, piya prem piyala|
Thadh hou toh girgir parta, tere rang maatwala||

Baang jikar tabhi se bisri, jabse yah dil khoja||
Kah maluk ab kaja na kariho, dil hi so dil laya||
Makka hajj hiye mey dekha, pura mursid paya||_
Oh Satguru Sahib, I am becoming mad in the desire of
having your darshan. I want to take your darshan
repeatedly. From the time I bathed in your love, I became
carefree. I am not conscious of my body. I am stuck mad
with your love. I cannot even stand, I fall down. Hey
Sahib, it is my wish, like a house servant let me stand in
your Darbar. Wearing the crown of servitude to others
(Paro upkar), I have forgotten Namaz, Roza, etc. From the
time, I found him in my heart, I have stopped reciting
Namaz. Maluk Daas say now I have developed true love
for him from my heart. My heart is dissolved in him.
Therefore, I have given up all the wickedness and vices.
Attaining a complete Guru, I have seen Macca, Madina, etc
inside me.

##### Immersed in the Brotherhood of Guru

##### ( Guru paai mey gota lijey khay)

```
Yahi samay guru paay mey gota lije khay||
Gota lijey khay naam ke sarvar mahi|
Avadhi aai nagichan daav phir aisa nahi||

```

100 Sahib Bandgi
_Tan man dijey daan bahuri nahi aana jaana||
Paltu bilam na kijiye aisa aausar paay|
Yahi samay guru panch mey gotha lijey khay||_
With humility, offer your love at the feet of Guru.
Surrendering your body and mind, be in his company then
repeated birth in Sansar will end.

##### Moving away from the worldly life

_Pahile sansar se tori aavey, tab baat piya ki puchhiye ji|
Tarvar dui tho hey myan ek, kis bhanti se vamey kijiye ji||
Meethey pyaley ko durr karo, karu prem piyala pijiye ji|
Paltu jab sis utari dharey, tab rah piya ki lijiye ji||_
If you want to ask for way to meet Parampurush, then
first you should break free from this Sansar. If you talk
about dearness, two swords cannot stay in a single
scabbard. Giving up the sweet pleasures, you have to taste
the bitterness of love. When you cut off the ego filled head
of 'I', then only you will find that path which will take you
to Parampurush.

##### Make place for love of Guru in you

_Kafan ko bandhi ke karey tab ashiqi,
Ashiq jab hoy tab naahi sovey|
Chinta binu aagi ke jarey din raati jab,
Jivat hi jaan se sati hovey||
Bhuk piyas jag aas ko chhod kari,
Aapni aapu se aap khovey|
Daas paltu kahe isak maidan par,
Dei jab sis tab naahi rovey||_
Paltu sahib says that a true lover of a Satguru keeps the
mind in the coffin and become dearer to him. He becomes
sleepless, day and night, he feels the pain of separation,
and he becomes Sati while living. He gives up food, drink,
and the desires of the world and forgets himself. Paltu
sahib says they give up the individuality- 'I' ness in the
field of love without regret.


The Real Disciple 101

##### Dearest, Give up the Pride and Surrender

_Piya se maan na kijey sajani, sajni hath taji dijey||
Jo tu piya ko chahey pyari, satsangati bhaji lijey||
Paltu daas tan man dhan de key, prem piyala pijey||_
Paltu daas while explaining says- Oh sweetheart! Do
not pride yourself in front of your dearest Satguru give up
your stubbornness. If you want to be dear to him, attain his
Satsang and surrendering your Tan, Maan, Dhan and love
him.

##### All pilgrimage at the Lotus feet of Guru

_Sab tirath guru ke charanan larey| charan bart drudh sada
humarey||
Charankaval ki nisdin pooja| parsu aur dev naahi duja||
Ishtt humarey guru ke charana| guru ke charan dhyan hu karna||

Charandaas guru charan tumharey| jivan praan adhar humarey||
Guru ke charan mukti phal daayak| sahajo guru ke charan
sahayak||_
Sahajo bai says that all the pilgrimage centers stays at
the feet of Satguru. Therefore hold on to his feet firmly,
offer Pooja only to him day and night and not to any other.
With the desire for the holy feet of Satguru, meditate on
him. Take his feet as more than your life and developing
love you can cross the worldly ocean of life (Sansar). If at
all if there is any desire, it should for the holy feet of
Satguru. Profit, loss, pleasure, pain, or death be always at
the feet of Satguru. Satguru grants the fruit of salvation.
Sahajo bai says to her Guru Charandas "Your holy feet are
the basis for my existence."

##### Life Surrendered

_Jivan Ka Maine Saup Diya, Tab Bhar Tumharey Haatho Mey|
Uddhar Patan Ab Mera Hey, Sarkaar Tumhare Hatho Mey||

Oh Satguru, I leave all my problems in your hand. My
success or failure is in your hand. Pleading like this with
the Satguru, it is said we are caught in the turbulent waves
of worldly ocean of life,you only can save us.

##### Be Passionate about it.

_Agar Hai Shauk Milne Ka, Toh Hardam Lo Lagata Ja|

Pakadkar Naam Ka zadu, Safa Kar Hujare Aey Dil Ko|

Baju Ka Todkar Kuja, Sharabey Shauk Pita Ja||
Na Ho Mulla Na Ban Brahman, Dui Ka Tark Kar zagda|
Hukam Nama Kalandar Ki, Analahak Tu Sunata Ja||_
Buleyshah says- if you have desire to meet the Supreme
lord then keep your concentration all the time at him. Burn
the pleasures of the world to ashes and with the broom of
Naam sweep your heart clean. Whatever mistakes you have
done until now, you forget that. You do not observe Roza
and starve and need not do Sijida (prayer) in the Masjid.
You should give up the feeling of 'I' ness and put effort
from your heart to meet the Supreme lord; let this desire of
intoxication be in you. Neither, you should become Mulla
nor Brahman. Give up this fight and take the message of
Sant to the people of the world.

##### Love of a Guru is hard to achieve

```
Guru Sey Lagan Kathin Hai Bhai|
Lagan Lagey Bin Kaaj Na Sarihey, Jiv Pralay Hoi Jai||
Jaisey Papiha Pyaasa Bund Ka, Piya Piya Rati Lai|
Pyasey Praan Tadfe Din Raati, Aur Tir Nahi Bhai||
```

The Real Disciple 103
_Jaisey Mirga Shabd Sanehi, Shabd Sunan Ko Jaai|
Shabd Suney O Praan Dan De, Tani Ko Nahi Derai||
Jaisey Sati Chade Sat Upar, Piya Ki Raah Man Bhai|
Pavak Dekh Darey Vaha Nahi, Hasat Baith Sara Maai||
Do Dal Sanmukh Aan Jude Hai, Sura Let Ladai|
Tuk Tuk Hoi Gire Dharni Par, Khet Chhodi Nahi Jai|
Chhodo Tan Apney Ki Aasha, Nirbhay Hoi Gun Daai|
Kahat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Nahi Toh Janam Nasai||_
To love your Guru is not an easy task, but without this
love, there is no benefit in this life. Just like Papiha bird
awaits for the swati drop (first drop of the rain) to quench
his thirst and repeatedly keep calling for it. Even if he has
to die, it will not drink any other water. In the same way,
the disciple should not seek support any other than his
Satguru. Just as how a Muskdeer falls in love with the
sound of Flute and gives up his life pursuing it. Just as a
wife out of love for her husband, gives her life as Sati
without fearing the fire. Just as a warrior stays in the battle
field and do not run away even if they were to be cut to
pieces. Similarly, sacrificing the desires of the body,
fearlessly love your Guru otherwise life will become a
waste.

##### Remain unattached – Recluse

```
Aisi rahni raho bairagi|
Sada udas rahey maya sey, satyanam anuragi||
Chhima ki kanthi seel sarouni, surti sumirni jagi|
Topi abhay bhakti mathey par, kal kalpana tyaagi||

#### 3. How long will keep the world ignorant?

Devotion is vitiated these days. We have to understand
the pure forms of devotion. How to engage in devotion?
What is devotion (Bhakti)? It is important to know this.
_Bhakti Na Hoi Jata Badhaye|Bhakti Na Hoi Bhabhut Ramaye||
Bhakti Na Hoi Nachey Gaye|Bhati Na Hoi Ghant Bajaye||_
Singing and dancing does not constitute devotion.
Devotion is spoiled. How did it happen? This is because of
two reasons. First is 'Ignorance' and second is 'selfishness'.
Ignorance and selfishness has spoiled the devotion, for
these reason Bhakti is vitiated. What is Ignorance? People
are engaged in devotion without knowing its principals.
Some for the tree, some for the lake of something and
some for other things, they are engaged in such devotions.
Everyone started devotion as per their perceptions. Some
are taken Yagya as Bhakti, some took Karma as Bhakti,
some are growing their hair for Bhakti and for some
singing and dancing as Bhakti. In truth these are not
Bhakti, these are all perversion of Bhakti. Sahibji says in
his words clearly-
_Bhakti Hoi Nahi Murat Pooja|Pahan Seve Kya Tohi Suza||
Vimal Gavey Aru Rovey|Kshan EkParam JanmKo Khovey||
Esey Sahib Manat Nahi|Yeh Sab Kal Roop Key Chahi||_
Now the question is why people are following such
Bhakti ignorantly. How did Bhakti got this kind of
publicity? It's because of selfishness. Some with their
selfish motto kept people in ignorance. They have made
Bhakti as a business.
We do see that some worship demons, some do yagya
(sacrificial fire), some go on pilgrimage and some go on
circumambulation (parikrama). Why did people loss their
way? How are they deceived? We have to think about it.
When man forgets his way, first he tries to find out his
location.


The Real Disciple 105
In the path of Supreme lord, if people are lost, why are
they lost? Are they not using their discrimination? By
doing such things they seek reward, is it proper? If it is not,
then why are they pursuing? Sants have warned.
If deeply enquire we can realize, with this type of
bhakti we cannot obtain realization of Atma. In the
scriptures, it is said Paramatma is in the Atma. This way
with the prevailing forms of devotion, whether one can
attain benefits or not; Sant says with warning that it will
not yield result. Then why are the people engaged? What is
its background? From where did this vitiation come? Why
did we lose the direction? Is it not that somebody has
deliberately misleading us?
Once we were on a tour and we had to stop for
refreshments. I was left back to buy provisions for the
snacks. We reached a road junction in Lucknow. We asked
direction for Sultanpur from a riksha driver just before the
road cross. He replied, "Go straight from the road cross.
Do not stop anywhere and do not ask anyone, Babuji, go
straight". I thought that he has given the direction then
what is the need to say, "Do not ask anyone"? I stopped my
vehicle at the crossing. A man approached my vehicle. I
asked him for the direction for Sultanpur. He told me to go
straight and take a right turn. In the meanwhile, another
two three persons approached and asked us to go straight
and take right. I did not ask them but they volunteered to
help me. I thought why the riksha driver misguided me.
When I moved forward, I saw an open and desolate place. I
realized their plan. They deliberately misguide and loot
people. The people who had guided me at the crossing
were part of the dacoit group. I turned back my vehicle and
proceeded straight. Strangers do as per direction. They
volunteered to help. There were three to four people. When
you listen to only one person, you will not be confident.
When more people say, you tend to believe that. This is the
part of their plan.


106 Sahib Bandgi
Is it not that they are showing the wrong direction to
reach the supreme lord with the object of their own benefit!
It is a serious matter; we have to ponder on this. Today,
due to selfishness, people are misguiding others into
Unatmic Bhakti. Selfishness is hidden behind it.
It is just like someone opening a vegetable vending
shop, someone electrical shop and someone opening an
clothing shop. In the same way, people have opened
different shops for their own survival. Some say to attend
their programme and listen to stories and assures you that
you will cross sansaar but it is not so. It cannot happen like
that way. You have to listen to story and put it into practice
to get rid of sins but for the selfish motives, wrong path is
shown to people. In the same way, some say, you perform
yagya and attain benefits. It is a wonderful way to fool the
people. They say benefit will occur. Yes, it will occur only
to the Mahatma; they will loot lakhs of people by taking
donations from them. Then the payment for the middleman
is different. Even 11,000 rupees is insufficient for them.
The presiding deities of yagya have different rates. If you
desire benifit then you have to part money. If this is not
possible for you, then listen to stories, there are no other
ways.
Listening to stories has better benifits than yagya. In
this, you get more instructions to be followed. However, in
this, a subscription plays a bigger part. From the
subscriptions, Mahatma's supporters will steal a lot of
money. How long they can befool the world. One day,
world realize. On that day, neither the Mahtma nor the
pundit will be traceable.
All this goes on only for the money. These days, there
are lot of Yagyas been performed. One hundred and one
thousand pits are more popular. Why is it so? To explain
this, is bit difficult, you may have to enquire, or we can
assume the more the number of Yagna pits, the more
pleased will be the deity's concern. People who suffer from


The Real Disciple 107
diseases perform yagya in a Nirogya pit, it means, a
person, who have multiple health problems,he should
perform it. However, those who want to take the seat at
the pit may have to offer thousand rupees to the Mahatma
first. This is the fee for the Yagya with which they seek the
God. Then there is a Yagna kunda for those who are
childless. They can take that place and get blessed with
child but they also should pay the fee. Cannot understand
why Brahmaji has to create men and women. Here,
everything is created with yagna. Then there is a yagna
kunda for those who seek wealth. Only rich man can
become richer. Poor men who cannot afford to pay one
thousand rupees have no access to reach god. Similarly,
there are many kundas, yagna peets for other requirement
so that no customers will return without yagya.
The material cost of each Kunda, is about 1000 rupees
and lakhs of receipts will be sold for the same. Now the
play of seeking for charity gets start. They knock the door
of the houses for such donations. The householders are
forced to give to the them. Poor people suffer in this, in
order not to annoy the deities of Yagya, they are forced to
part with their money. Then from the bigger shop owners,
they take thousand rupees, no. they snatch thousand rupees
even without offering a seat for them at the Yagna kunda.
Nobody can escape without paying. What? Is this bhakti?
No. even the learned scholar among the society do not
realise this, then who will understand this.
Today, in the field of Bhakti, business has entered.
When the program is telecast on the T.V, they give the
address and number detail for sending donations. We say,
talk about Bhakti. If they take money for teaching yoga, is
their any service to society. Even magicians make money
by displaying magic. If you look to the past, Sants have
never taken money from the people. If you are imparting
Adhyatmic knowledge to anyone and in return, you take


108 Sahib Bandgi
money, it is clear that you are doing business. You are
proving your selfishness.
Somebody has collected five lakhs twenty-five
thousand rupees for carrying out Mrutunjay Yagya and
offered it to somebody who can do it for five lakh rupees.
The person who did the Yagya, his parents expired. He
could not save them. The one, who has come, has to leave
some day. Then what is this Yagya? Sants have alerted:
_Aaye Hai Toh Jayenge, Raja Rank Fakir||_
Sants went around to warn people. They never asked
for any wealth from people. If the followers offered them,
it was ok but they spend it for the public, not on
themselves. Sahib has pointed out the involvement of
Business in the field of religion (Dharma) so he said:
_Pet Key Karan Karey Guruvai|Pidhi Sahit Narak Mey Jaai||_
Today, you will not find pure devotion (Bhakti). In the
assembly of court of lion (King), lion raised a query. Lion
asked, "What is the condition of poor in our country"?
First, the elephant (Minister) raised his trunk and asked for
the permission to speak. In between, the dog (soldier),
started barking and said, "You roam around begging house
to house. What answer can you give?" The King intervened
and asked the soldier to keep quite. Now the minister came
in the front and said to the king that there are many poor in
this country and those who are donating have become tired
of donation. King said, "What are you saying"? Minister
said, "I am telling you the truth. In our country, there are
various types of beggars but there are mainly of two types:
one is an ordinary beggar and other is a beggar from higher
status strata. Ordinary beggars include the one with the
begging bowls, the one with the bell, the one with the
blanket, the one who seeks with the hand. Beggars of the
higher strata are number one beggar, in this are included
those who collect subscriptions. Just a few days back, there
was a Raj Sadhu (Jackal) from another jungle made a visit.
He got subscription collected from every house. It was a


The Real Disciple 109
suprise that many were collecting subscription. Even our
own members were involved in this. Raja, our citizens are
very poor. They were keeping the receipts". Telling this,
Minister wept. Queen fox consoled him and made him
calm- "Mantriji, It does not matter, it is happening in every
jungle. I have heard that there will be collection of
subscription by raj sadhu even in our jungle also." King
says- "we have not sent any invitation to anyone".
Minister- "Begger does not want any invitation, King.
They themselves come". Queen- "King, there are some
beggers. They have made some toll collection post where
they stop everyone and will not allow them to pass without
payment. If such element enters our forest, it will be
difficult to live". King- "The matter is very serious. I feel
that they will slowly loot the entire kingdom. It will be
difficult to stop. When the entire citizens are ready for such
kind of looting, who is there to stop them? At least I will
not let it happen in my forest".
Raja has asked the entire assembly in one voice "Is it
true that everybody is facing such problem?" Everybody
replied, "Yes King. We are all very concerned, please do
something".
Therefore, the King pronounced his order, "Those who
indulge in the collection of any subscription, whether
wealthy or poor, will be put inside the prison for six
months and pay a fine of 100 rupees".
If you look at, you will notice, today beggers are
looting the country. Just as in the Jungle, if a law is enacted
in the country, people will escape from such problems. In
truth, the world of begger is become entirely different.
These days, the work of a beggar has become a blessing.
They have complete freedom from all. Atleast the theives
are caught by police but nobody is willing to touch these
beggars. Everybody is in an anxious state because they
have to give money under compulsion.


110 Sahib Bandgi
It has become tyrannical; it looks like you have to be
liberated from them before you make an attempt to cross
the sansaar. They rome around every street and village in
collection of subscriptions. What is happening in this
world? A poet began to think. It was the twilight. He was
tired. He took a deep sleep. In the mean time, somebody
knocked the door. He wondered who is knocking at that
time. He just opened the door and peeped outside, he saw
an old man standing with some kind of dairy. Thinking of
it, his eye looked for an answer. The old man told that Peer
baba's bhandara took place (distribution of food) yesterday.
The poet said, "What can I do about it"? Old man asked-
"Brother, give me some money". He thought what kind of
person he is. Bhandara took place yesterday and today he
has come for money. May be the collection was
insufficient. He told him "I will not give babaji". Baba left
the place disappointed, he was expecting because he had a
lot of receipts in his hand. Closing the door, the poet has
become thoughtful again. In the night, even in his dream,
the thought did not leave him. Even the heaven appeared
full of beggars; the angels (Devta) were not visible.
Uttering 'Narayan Narayan', many of them were seeking
alms. He enquired with some, whether begging takes place
in Heaven also; they got angry. They said, "Begging takes
place only in the hell, here we collect subscriptions
(chanda). There is pride in Heaven also. Yamraj was
preparing bills. The poet understood that heaven is the
place for wealthy beggars. He asked one of them and he
replied, "In the begging bowl, you get less but with the
receipts, you get more than five times".
He could hear, Sound of 'Narayan Narayan' again in the
heaven. He asked, "Oh Naradmuni! Where were you all
this time? What is happening in the heaven these days?
Even with you". " No, No, Dont saylike that. indeed, there
is an increase in the number of beggars on the earth. All
those who donate are worried". It is becoming difficult to


The Real Disciple 111
live, for ordinary people. Few days back, a decision was
taken by Vishnuji to send some beggars to heaven and
some to hell. Those rich beggars were sent to hell and poor
ones to the heaven. The condition of hell became bad. The
rich beggars cleaned the hell completely. In the heaven, the
beggars have spoiled my name. Poet has asked, "How is
that"? They wander collecting materials, calling 'Narayan
Narayan'. People, who hear, take it as Narad is asking". So
the poet said, "it is really nothing. Why do you worry so
much"? Even on earth, same thing is happening. They spoil
the name of the Sants in the guess of sadhus. They are
tearing receipt after receipts. In the name of sants, they are
begging at evey door for collection.
Accidently, his eye fell on the liquor shop. Poet was
getting angry. Passer by warned him, not to get angry
otherwise the baggers will beat him. Nobody invites
problem from them. Even Vishnu Maharaj also keeps
quite. Did you not notice that in front of army of beggars,
even the Devtas bow their head. Feeding they fatten
themselves and become strong. If they give a blow, you
will fall straight on the earth. Don't know what had happen
to Vishnuji. It looks like the heaven will end up in the
hands of beggars.
When he got up from sleep, it was already morning, it
was sunrise, dogs were barking continuously. The whole
night they were barking. Just as no one giving attention
towards them, people were busy in extending the
hospitality to the beggars. The poet looked through the
window. Group after group they were moving, shouting
_Dan Diye Dhan Na Ghate, Kah Gaye Sant Kabir|
Guru Hamare Aayenge, Karo Daan Kuchh Danveer||_
The poet has uttered through his mouth:
_Mangan Maran Saman Hai, Mat Koi Mango Bheekh|
Mangan Te Marna Bhala, Satguru Dete Seekh||_
Let us move forward. The world of Hypocrites is very
big. Similarly, on the other side astrologersand,Tantriks
and alike are cheating the people. Beating the drum they


112 Sahib Bandgi
make mother, daughter, etc. dance. Creating the fear of the
demons and evil spirits they are looting not only to the
illiterate, even to educated also, they are confusing the
devotees. Earlier, people used to read Ramcharitramanas in
every house but now, demons and evil spirits take that
place. That is why, , some rituals are taking place for
demons and evil spirits, in every house. Heads are rotating
in every house.This rotation is a deliberate attempt. It
affects, not a single member of family, but whole family
gets compeled to involve. In this act, they forget about the
supreme lord. If thought comes, it is only of Sayana demon
or Tantrik demon. The talk is on so and so demon,
removed so many demons. This is the talk of the world
today.
Astrologers are creating fears on the effects of planets.
The science of astrology is correct; this work is for well
educated in this field. Now a day in this field, people are
after money, so anyone can become astrologers. People are
also entangled in this. World is moving towards wrong side
of Bhakti. That is why there is increase in sinful deeds.
The hypocrites does not know the path to reach the
Poorna Paramatma, they misguide people into the wrong
ways. They unload some of their bookish knowledge so
that people will develop some faith then they start directing
them in all kind of direction. They start talking about some
rituals and its benefits. Have you come here for seeking to
enjoy the fruits or attaining liberation? Now the Mahatmas
has created atmosphere, they tell some stories, they tell one
or two stories, Doha of Kabir Sahib and at the end they get
up and dance and they make the entire audience
(Satsangies) also to dance. What is happening? They are
the Hypocrites. From these hypocrites emerge all the
wickedness, cheating, and sins because-
_Bhakti Hoi Nahi Nachey Gaye| Bhakti Hoi Nahi Ghant Bajaye|
Bhakti Hoi Nahi Murat Pooja| Paahan Seve Kya Tohi Suja||
Vimal(2) Gavey Aru Rovey|Kshan Ek Param JanmKo Khovey||
Esey Sahib Manat Nahi|Yeh Sab Kal Roop Key Chhahi||_


The Real Disciple 113
...Then they become cartoon just as the people wished.
Some keeps 2-3 feet long matted hair, in some cases they
keep 1-2 feet long beard, some wear long dhotis, some
apply Sandalwood paste on their forehead and stick some
rice on them. We do not know their inner intentions, only if
we ask we may get an answer. This way they engaged with
the world. What is the need to show the truth path to the
world? World shows path to them, they simply walk in that
direction. Whatever worldly people desire, Mahatma
becomes like that. Just like in the world of cinema, the
actors behave such that their audience would like to enjoy,
in the same way, Mahatmas dance to the expectation of the
audience.No one from the audience should become
annoyed. Least anyone should be angry. He has no spiritual
power, nothing. Whatever they read they place it before the
people. Sahib has said eloquently-
_Mera Tera Manuva, Kaisey Ik Hoi Rey|
Mey Kehta Hu Aankhin Dekhi, Tu Kahta Kagad Ki Lekhi|
Mey Kehta Surzavan Hari, Tu Rakhiyo Urzaai Rey|
Mey Kehta Hu Jagat Rahiyo, Tu Rehta Hai Soi Rey|
Mey Kehta Nirmohi Rahiyo, Tu Jata Hai Mohi Re|
Jugan Jugan Samuzavat Hara, Kaha Na Manat Koi Re|
Tu Toh Randi Phire Vihandi, Sab Dhan Daare Khoi Re|
Satguru Dhara Nirmal Bahey, Bamey Kaya Dhoi Re|
Kahat Kabir Suno Bhai Sadho, Tab Hi Vaisa Hoi Re||_
During the time of Kabir Sahib, when the fame of Sahib
spread as a ideal Gyani (Supreme Wisdom), many great
Yogis, Brahmagyanis, critics and the thinkers leaving their
path slowly started coming to the feet of Kabir Sahib. A
scholar came to Sahib with a bullock-cart loaded with
books. On the way a girl, Kamali was fetching water. The
scholar asked the girl, the direction for Kabir Sahib's
residence. Looking at the bullock-cart, the girl could not
control her laughter. Even the pot she was bearing broke.
When he asked for the reason of her conduct, she replied-
_Kabir Ka Ghar Dur Hai, Taha Silhali Gail|
Pauv Na Padey Pipilika, Pandit Ladey Bail||_


114 Sahib Bandgi
The scholar with long hair and beard, Sandalwood paste
on his forehead and a cart load of books was trying to seek
Kabir Sahib. What did he know that Kabir Sahib's house is
on the hilltop and it is not easy to go there, the way is
slippery,even a small ant also gets slip over there. Further,
how can he carry loads of book?
This way, the hypocrites spread their messages and
activities, true devotion disappeared. Some roam around
with many Malas around their neck and they give it for
others. May be they believe that, Mala will take them to
Paramatma. Some wear a shawl printed with the name
Ram Ram etc. Maybe he believes that the shawl will take
him to Paramatma and we also blindly follow him. Maybe
because these colorful things, attract our eye. Even
otherwise, what is the concern of such things to devotion
(Bhakti)? How does it matter if there are no cartoons in the
movie, there are plenty we can see in the world? Oh
Brothers! Neither the Mala nor the shawl will take you
there. The shawl will remain here only, then how can you
take its support to reach there. That which you required to
do, you are not doing. You are unable to understand the
words of Satguru who takes all to reach the Supreme lord,
now and in future but everyone is trying to reach there with
the help of lifeless things.
...The goal of the river is ocean, it moves in the
direction, on and on without rest. It cuts through the banks
and the shoreline and takes the soil along with them to the
ocean because only on reaching the ocean, it can rest. On
the way, small ponds and lakes water also joins them and
the river takes them along to the ocean. Those water lets
who remain away from the river in the gutters, distant
ponds, etc; with time they are infected with germs and
insects and slowly it dries off.
Those Jivas who did not reach the river of Satguru and
remain away without joining, what will happen to them?
They will also meet the same fate as the water, which


The Real Disciple 115
remained away from the river. The wind of Kaal will soak
away, the life of Jivas and for some time revolve around
hell and heaven; and end up in the 84 Lakhs of life forms.
They will have endless journey. Who can say which dirty
Yonis they will pass through? The moral of this is to reach
the Ocean-Parampurush, the only way is the graceful feet
of Satguru. Instead, if you seek support elsewhere, you will
suffer in the end because-
_Bin satguru bachihe nahi, phir budhey bhav mahi|
Bhavsagar ki traas mey, satguru pakade bahi||_
Lifeless stone, ocher robe, dhoti, mala; all these are
signs of hypocrites. These are not the identity of devotees.
We can garland a donkey, ocher robe the monkey; you can
hang a precious stone around it’s neck. Even with all these,
you cannot call them as devotees. To rise the Hindus and
Muslims, above such practices; Kabir Sahib used very
harsh words. Cautioning Hindus, Kabir Sahib says-
_Patthar Pujhey Hari Miley, Toh Mey Puju Pahar|
Tatey Vaha Chakki Bhali, Pis Khay Sansaar||_
And
_Mala Ferat Yug Bhaya, Phira Na Man Ka Pher|
Kar Ka Manka Chhodkar, Man Ka Manka Pher||_
Rebutting the Muslims Kabir Sahib says-
_Kankar Patthar Jori Ko, Masjid Lai Banay|
Ta Chadhi Mulla Baang Dey, Bahira Hua Khudai||_
And-
_Din Bhar Roja Rahat Hai, Rat Hanat Hai Gaai|
Yaha Toh Khoon Vaha Bandgi, Kaisey Khushi Khudai||_
Kabir Sahib was a true revolutionary Sant. He pulled
out the hypocrites from the root, and threw them away. Just
like today, those days also hypocrite Babas moving among
people, cheated them of their wealth. Some Sayane
(wicked people), Ojha (tantriks); they became wealthy.
Sahibji has cautioned people about those hypocrites.
Therefore, the hypocrites were opposed to him from that
time. Some were referring to him as Muslim and some as
low caste. Some time they said he was the premarital son


116 Sahib Bandgi
of Brahman woman and some time as a weaver. All these
are with the intention to keep people away from Kabir
Sahib and let their business go on without hindrance.
Sayane, Ojha, etc; their activities were not related to
Bhakti. Some under the guise of Bhakti were hosting the
flag of hypocrites. Sahib has warned the world against
them.
_Jali Hai Sutku Thal Hai Sutku, Sutak Aupati Hoi|
Janmey Sutku Muye Puni Sutku Sutak Paraj Bigoi||
Kahu Rey Pandiya Kaun Pavita|
Aisa Giaanu Japhu Mere Mita||

```
_Kabir Manu Mundiya Nahi Kais Mudaye Kav|

If we look around the world, we can see people with
ochre robe. We calls some of them as devotees. May be we
have forgotten the warnings given by Kabir Sahib. Why
are we entangled with such hypocrites? There are two
reasons for these. Either the hypocrites have hypnotized us
or we ourselves have become hypocrites. Instead of
crossing Bhavasagar, we are being more immersed in it.
We have given the contract of entanglement to some Baba
and everybody is following blindly. If we enquire with an
open Mind, we will feel a sense of shame for our actions. If
Atma is a part of Paramata, then Atma has connection only
with Paramata. The one who makes this connection is
Satguru. Then who is fourth one which is more powerful
than these three (Atma,Paramata & Satguru) who are
frightening us with planet, stars, demons, evil spirits, etc;
and entangles we in this? Who are they; whom we afraid of


The Real Disciple 117
so much? They are directing us to do all kinds of things
and suggest do this, do that. Why are we engaged in all
these? We show off that we are free from the influence of
Sayane, Tantrik, Astrologers, Baba, etc; but as soon as we
encounter problems, we bend before them.
It is true, it is indication of Kaliyug that opposing the
true Sants, public have joined the hypocrites. The
hypocrites rule this world; only their devotion is
established.
_Yaha Kaliyug Ayo Abai, Sadhu Na Maney Koi|
Kami Krodhi Maskhara, Inki Pooja Hoi||_
A story comes to the mind. A Baba was sitting under a
tree with eyes closed by the bank of the river. People were
showing reverence to him. Accidently, a fox and a donkey
reached that spot.
The fox asked his friend donkey with hesitation, "What
is he doing here?"
"Oh you do not know, he is meditating on God! He is a
Yogi, Yogeshwar Maharaj ji. He has a wife, three children
and lakhs of devotees.All of them call him as Babaji." Said
the donkey with emotion filled voice- "Indeed, he is Yogi
of new age. These days, you will find them in plenty. To
explain them is very difficult. Then why did they call him
as Sanyasi when they live like Kings. Why do they call
them as giver when they are taking donations? Nobody has
answers for these questions."
...Fox began to laugh- "you are a donkey. What
happens because of public opinion? They take monkey as
an Avatar (Incarnation) and keep them in a closed room;
and they are being killed innocently. Let me tell you about
his meditation. This man was very poor. He had no
business or work; he was living as a decoit. Even to take
care of his children was difficult for him. The mistake is
his alone. First thing,if he was so poor then why did he get
marry?" Donkey was silently listening..."The business
(becoming babaji)he had started later on. There is a benefit


118 Sahib Bandgi
in these. It is not only him; there are lakhs like him in our
country. I heard it that some among them are married
twice. It makes no difference to them. Nobody can say
anything to it. Vast majority accepts it. When they become
old, their sons become babaji." With the sense of
agreement Donkey said- "But people call him Yogi Baba."
Fox said- "Mr. Donkey, a true Yogi will not be in the
company of woman. Those who are entangled in sex with
woman can never engage in Yoga." Donkey asked- "Its
alright, can we call him as a Sanyasi?" Fox says-"You
cannot straighten the dog's tail, similarly your intelligence
cannot become better. We call such a person Sanyasi who
give up house and everything but these persons are living
in palatial houses. These people are more than just seekers
of pleasures. To call them as Yogis and Sanyasis is
farfetched." Looking at the Fox, Donkey made a last
attempt saying- "As it is, they offer a lot to the poor
people." Fox replied- "Donkey Maharaj! You call them
charitable. I say there is no greater beggar than this people
are. You do not know whenever they go some place; they
collect lot in the name of donations before hand. What is
this, if not begging?"
It become twilight and they left for their respective
homes. Some days later, Donkey reached the house of Fox
early in the morning. Now he began to understand and told
the Fox that whatever you told me that day, now I slowly
began to understand. I have understood that good people
are not allowed to go forward by the world because
everybody is walking on the crooked path, they are
cheating each other. For this reason, they are preventing,
the good people to move forward. They understand that in
the advancement of good people, their secrets will be
revealed. Fox replied-"You are absolutly correct." Donkey
said excitedly- "Now I understood everything. That day
you were talking against that meditating Sant so much.
You were speaking ill of him. Even I said something. What


The Real Disciple 119
did I know?" Fox replied with satisfaction- "It does not
matter, Donkey Ji. There are many like you, they will
realize slowly."...Donkey goes on his work making sounds
and with the sense of awareness.
Same way, people have established devotion for their
selfish purpose; people have made to pursue wrong forms
of Bhakti. Some says give charity and engage in
meritirious deeds, your sins will be cleansed, some says
bath in the holy river and sins will be washed. This is out
of their selfishness. With such devotional practices, people
became free from the fear of sins. Some are made to
worship Demons, Evil spirit. Is it not the Bhakti based on
selfishness? This is forbidden even in Vedas. Those who
do such a devotion, attain only that state. Vasudev Krishna
told Arjuna- "Oh Arjuna! Those who are devoted to
ancestors, they will attain Pitrulok (Ancestral World);
those who are devoted to Devas, they attain Dev-lok; those
who are worshipping Demons and Evil Spirits, they take
birth in them. Therefore, giving up these Bhaktis, merge
only in me". Now you have to sincerely enquire as to why
they are engaged in sending us into Evil Spirits! Why they
want to send us there? There is selfishness hidden behind
it. They are concerned with money only, they dont care
about what happens to people.
Shastras are against such Bhakti and forbidds them.
Then why are they beating the drum and making fool out
of everyone? Just like how the Britishers taught the army
compulsorily the practise of March past because with this,
power of mental senses (Naadi) weakens. The belief
among people that the defence personels are less intelligent
is correct. This is the reason. Britishers use this practice to
make us lose intelligence. The power of thinking reduces
with this. In the same way, Sayanas affects people. They
make them to rotate their head which makes them mad.
Even if a wresteler does this, he will become mad, suffer
unconsious and also power of discrimination will reduce.


120 Sahib Bandgi
Then what will happen to those mothers, sisters and
daughters who rotate their heads for hours? Even a healthy
mother will become mentally mad.
If you look at the field of devotion impartially, you will
observe that it is not correct, it is like a contagious disease,
earlier it was not like that but now it is spread. Ordinary
people are afflicted with Kidney failures, Joint pains, Heart
disease, Blood pressure, Mental disorder, etc. People have
to face a lot of problems. There were no such a problems
earlier. Such a dangerous diseases did not exist earlier. If
you probe this, you can identify two basic problems. First,
the food habbits of people are not correct because they are
using urea and other chemicals. Our ancestors were not
taking these chemicals. They were not using insecticide
also. All these things have an ill effect. Similarly, if you
look at the field of religion, you will identify the causes.
We are using contaminated water. The first stage of
water is dirty and even the second stage is not good. The
water which is below 100 feet is good but many drink dirty
water. Therefore, our food and the environments are not
good. Our ancestors lived in a good environment. They
were taking pure food. The other is the mental problem.
People suffer from anxiety and hypertension. These are on
everybody's head. It has become so much that son makes
his father anxious, brother puts his brother in tension. With
these mental disorders, gives rise to other complications.
With tension, Kidney can be affected, can lead to heart
attack, it can lead to blood pressure. This way, people
suffer because of these two basic problems.
Let us take a look at the field of Devotion. Is it also
afflicted? You have to see honestly. Just like the food and
anxiety, these two becomes a basis for the diseases. In the
same way, we have to accept the afflictions in the field of
devotions. The field of Devotion is spoiled by three group
of peoples:

1. Attack of Gangsters (apradhi tabka)


The Real Disciple 121

2. Attack of Business-minded (vyavsayik tabka)
3. Attack of pollitically-minded (rajnitik tabka)
   All the above three has done much harm to the field of
   devotion. If you take a look, drugs and narcotics are
   involved. In the name of subscription or donation,
   collecting money has become common and all these are
   forcefully collected. For this is criminal, it is an easy task,
   it does not cost anything. The pollution in Bhakti is
   evident. You can notice disease everywhere. Similarly, the
   affliction of Bhakti is evident. Let us ponder on this.
   Let us pay attention on the field of Bhakti. First, there is
   plenty of money in this. Money brings power and fame. It
   started with ritualistic worship (Pooja) of idols. These have
   started from the period of Empror Ashoka. He has build
   Buddhist monastries and erected statues of Buddha. Earlier
   Sanyasis were staying there, later when the women were
   allowed slowly they were engaged in pleasurable persuits.
   Therefore, religions of Buddha become afflicted.
   Later, when the Buddhiest monastries were subdued,
   the idols of Devis and Devtas were erected in those
   temples. Irrational Poojas were started from this; this
   formed the basis for Sagun Bhakti worship. The work of
   Buddist bhikshus (monks) has been followed. This is not
   an isolated practice, this is happening in all regions now.
   Taking the spiritual places as a safe heaven, gangsters
   entered. Why did they enter? It is a safe place to hide. The
   image of Bhakta provides a shield for them. Government
   ran a program for rehabilitation of dacoits to cleanse those
   persons who are engaged in decoity because they were
   looting anyone in the village, they were rapping women. In
   the valley of Chamabal, decoits could easily hide and
   escape. Police was not successful in apprehending them
   because of the terrain. Decoits could hide there safely, it is
   advantage for them. Similarly, criminals hide in the guise
   of Mahatmas.

Then comes the business-minded. Why did it come?
Because, businessmen saw lot of people to gather. One
Satsangi told me that they make small cup of clay for
lighting the lamp. He asked me whether they can sell it in
our Ashram. I disagreed because someone else may come
out with request to sell footware. Then, it will become
business establishment. Therefore, I told him, not to do
that.
How did the business enter? This is of two types.
Wherever there is a Satsang, donation takes place. They
collect money that way because five bundles have to be
given to the Guruji. If the Guru Maharaj does not get
money, he gets angry. Therefore, they collect donations.
Many ambitious people entered in the field of bhakti.
Externally, they show signs of devotion but their intentions
are different. If you look impartially, you will observe all
these happening. Sahib knew these 600 years back about
the rise of hypocrits so he cautioned before he left.
_Pait Key Karan Kare Guruvai, Peedhi Sahit Narak Mey Jaai||_
Similarly, politics also entered the field of Bhakti.
Politicians join Mahatma and establish illegal and secret
connections. Work of the politician will be to offer safety
and security for Mahatma; politicians will coverup their
mistakes and help them getting government lands free so
that they can run their business. Then Mahatmas will
ensure the politician concerned will get support and
increase in vote. All political parties are seeking vote in the
name of religion and caste whereas the constitution says,
"Do not seek vote on the basis of caste and creed" but they
have created some people specially for this purpose. They
take help of the scripture also (Saam, Daam, Dand, Bhed).
Therefore, Bhakti is afflicted with all the above three. Now
a day, you cannot find true bhakti anywhere. There is a
power in the Adhyatmic person, he helps you in
implementation. We have to contemplate about the
afflictions in the fields of Bhakti- "Politics, Business, and


The Real Disciple 123
Crime". Leaders send some Mahatmas asking them to
preach and later work for earning votes. Initially, they
work very well. Like the imposters, they collect dedicated
devotees and workers and later align with some political
parties. Earlier Mahatmas had influence over politicians,
today it is the opposite.
There is one more thing, they create fear among the
devotees and robe them. Some take money in the name of
Miracles and Black magic, some gives solutions for
overcomming sins and collect money, they promise to send
them to a good place after death and take money. All these
are crimes. They have taken the field of devotion for the
livelihood.
This way, in the field of Bhakti, corruption and
crookedness has entered. Today, more than 100 million
people are earning their livelihood in the name of Bhakti.
This is a serious matter. People are unable to understand,
they are kept in confusion.
Some people have taken up to wrong path of devotion
out of ignorance and some out of their selfishness. In the
times to come, people will realise all these. Satva has
failed, the game of yagya will also end. The Yagna kundas
will be empty; Mahatmas will be driven to anger but, they
will not find any customers to support Yagya. Even after
the Pandits will call, they will not respond but Satya Bhakti
of Sahib will increase by day.
With discrimination, we can understand the negative
implications of the religion. Why are we disregarding? The
intellectual should comprehend the facts. Sahibji has
fought the negative effects of the religious practices and
warned the people against them. Superstition has rised to
its level that it is beyond words. A Shishya gave me a
newspaper cutting, in that it was written that they given
'Guarantee of salvation for 11000 rupees'. There will not be
any investigation done on these people because they have
reach to Ministers. They are doing this with their guidance.


124 Sahib Bandgi
Just as other things are sold in market, salvation is also
sold. It means, in the times to come, it will be impossible
for poor people to attain Mukti. Earlier we heard, with
money we can overcome sin but now, we can even obtain
salvation with it and people were also after it and there
were bookings made. It means, those who have money they
can buy Salvation (Mukti). There are readymade Muktis
available (Made to order). Kabir Sahib has condemned
such practices. Just think it over what darkage Bhakti has
reached. They are teaching art of existance for 500 rupees.
Just as a magician collects money for his show, atleast he
admits that he is doing it for the sake of money. Religious
scholars under the protection of religions are collecting
money. People should understand whether it is a
methodology to make money or for a living! I understand,
it is only to earn money.
Some, approach with e-mail and to seek money. Some
are requesting bank draft. Those who give large amount,
their details are publisised so that similar large donners will
come and appease their hunger for money. Just think over,
are they Mahatma or Beggars. Gurunanakji had very big
people with him but he never asked any money from them.
Rich people visited Ravidas Maharaj but he never asked
money from them. He was making two footwear in a day.
One he would donate to the poor, he sold the other one and
spend the money on his food. One day, a Siddh came to
him and said- "Take this Paras Patthar (a special quality
stone which convert iron to gold). You are very poor, after
some days I will take it back from you." Ravidasji says “I
don’t want”.He forced him telling, you do not have any
money. Ravidas told him- "I have no need for it." He kept
on requesting him. At the end, Ravidasji told him- "Okay
keep it." He continued with his work. siddha kept it in a
place inside the hut and went away. He returned after few
months and saw Ravidas in the same hut making
footwears. He came with the thought that Ravidasji would


The Real Disciple 125
have made a bigger house. He asked for the Paras Patthar.
Ravidasji asked him "Which Paras Patthar?" he replied, "I
never knew that you can even tell lies said the Siddha. I left
after giving you Paras Patthar, the last time." Ravidas told
him, "Take a look at that place where you have kept, you
may find it." When he looked, he found it there only. It
means Ravidasji never even looked at it. However, these
days, Mahatmas do not speak without taking money.
Why the society does not think over it? Sahibs' word is
cautionary. He has created awareness among people and
asked them to be cautious. He told, "These all are not
bhakti." He has not condemned devotion, but gave a
warning.
Now days, I get to hear new things about myself. I
review the criticism and ask for the truth as to why they are
critising like that? I have come after 24 years of service,
why did people brand me as terrorist. When the soldier is
recruited, his complete details are documented. Whose son,
from which place, etc. then SP, DC sign the document.
Therefore, from where does the confusion arise? No, that
team is very dangerous.
Religions have lot of pitfalls in its observance. In the
Train they warns not to accept food from strangers because
it may be mixed with drugs. They may rob you once if you
fall unconscious eating that food. Why do they say because
it is the government's duty to warn people against theft.
Similarly, A Mahatma also, lives for the society; he
cautions and alerts them, he takes you to the right meaning
of the religious Dharmas. He does not accuse. When such
Mahatmas arrive and work selflessly for the betterment of
society, the society ill-treats him. Kabir Sahib was
sentenced to death on 52 occasions, Gurunanakji was put
behind bar, Sukratji was given poison, Tulsidas was sent to
prison by Akbar, Mirabai was given poison, Shivli was
hanged to death. If you look at the history, none of them
was honoured. It was only after the death, they are


126 Sahib Bandgi
worshipped by the world. They go to their place and bow
their head. It indicates that we have the practice of offering
Pooja to only bones.
A woman was my Naami, she was very devoted and
she was seva minded. She told me that she wants to contest
election. I told her not to contest that she is bound to lose.
She said, "How can I not contest, there is a thug in the
village; he beats up people, he troubles mothers and
daughters, he terrorizes everyone. If he wins, he will put
everybody into difficulty. I want to lead others for their
protection. They are expressing their wish for me and say
that they will vote for me." I asked her, "Not to contest."
because she will lose. She told that she has filled the
nomination paper also. Then I told her-"Okay, try and see."
The woman was very active. She was selfless and serving
the poor; and she was a retired teacher. After the election
she came to me, she was very much disturbed and said that
they have elected the thug, what kind of people are they. I
told her, the people did not defeat you, but it was the game
of the thug. The remaining thugs were concerned about
their welfare.They thought if the woman wins,she will
creat problem for them. therefore, they went door to door
in the night to confuse the people by saying what can this
old woman do in the advanced age. The woman told
everyone that there is too much of trouble from the thugs
there and said that she will serve and requested them to
cast their votes for her. But booth capturing takes place.
They do it in five different ways in India. That is why good
people are elected few in number.
First, capturing the ballet boxes (Booth capturing) may
be based on religion and caste. Second, they may caste
illegal ballet papers. Thirdly, some people may go to the
village where the opposition holds a strong position and
tell people not to cast their vote because they have not
received anything for their village since their last election.


The Real Disciple 127
Fourthly, they stand with sticks and obstructs. Fifth, they
stand with the gun. These ways, they cast their vote.
The woman came disturbed. I told her that I have
already explained to her and gave hint also. Similarly, if
Mahatmas try to bring any changes in the society, the
hypocrites turn the society against them and tell them not
to go there. They mislead them saying that he is changing
the religion, accuse saying that he is freeing them from
Devi Devtas. Fooling them, they keep them away from
truth.
There was a construction supervisor. He told me that he
is feeling very sad looking at the opposition for me
(Sahibji) from all sides. If people denounce him this
much,then it was impossible for him to come out of his
house, perhaps he commit suicide.I had told him that I
worked in the military forces for 24 years, served the
nation, then the service to the society; I have not caused
any difficulties for the society. I have not collected any
money; no such work. My lifestyle is known to all. Within
ten years and without asking for any donation, I have made
more than 150 ashrams.What I have taken from society! I
have released many from intoxicant, transformed lakhs of
people from Crow like to Hansa. If any Mahatma comes,
he collects crores of rupees but I have not done so. I have
not changed anybodys religion. Therefore, I am not sad or
in any anxiety. I knew that what is happening is wrong. I
do not have family relations to whom I will give
something. I am beyond bias. Service is my goal.They
want to attack my courage and so hatred towards me. It
makes no difference to me. Those who gives a blow is also
posses a capacity to bear a blow in return.
I work day and night in increasing the awareness of
people. I am not teaching any wrong principle of Bhakti.
Then what is the reason? Let public observe my people, my
disciples are good. No one has daring to speak lies,no one
has daring to take a bribe. We do not harm anybody in


128 Sahib Bandgi
thought, word and deed; and we do not collect any
donation or subscriptions. What is the basis of this
opposition? Since the time I said, religious Dharmas are
corrupted and misinterupted; and warned, the people to be
careful, the hypocrites are ganging against me.
You alert your children against a bad child who is a
thief and do not play with him; and tell them not to go with
such and such child. Similarly, I alert you against the
Astrologers, Tantriks, worshipping demons and spirits; be
alert. I warn you not to give any donations, do not believe
in demons and spirits because all these are not in your
favour. I am not saying baseless, this has the support of
scriptures.
Why not the society, contemplate on this? You see a
man across the street; he is holding a Parrot in the cage. He
shows your future, Parrot comes out of the cage, lifts an
envelope and goes back inside the cage. Then the man lifts
the envelope and opens it; pulls out a piece of paper in
which words are written. You say that the Parrot is
Mahatma which fore tells our future. You never think why
the parrot did not fly off. The world does not contemplate
on such issues that is why they are entangled. That man has
made the Parrot addicted to Opium. It has become
addicted. The owner addicts the Parrot with Opium, and
_then he lets the Parrot fly off. It may find fruits and other_
things to eat in open but it will not find opium available
outside so, the habit of addiction brings it back to the cage
on its own. Now the man knows that it will not fly off. It
lifts up envelope and you think that it is showing your
future. You never thought about the Parrot's problem.
On the railway platform, you take your weight
measurement on a machine. A printed ticket comes out
with your weight and some words written such as 'you are
very noble, you do not hurt anyone.' The words are also
very selective and cleverly arranged. It can be applied for
both male and female. It is written that you are very


The Real Disciple 129
beautiful but they use the word in Hindi 'Badey' and not
'Badi'. The word, 'Badey' is used for both gender where as
'Badi' is used for only a female. So they write with lot of
clever ideas. What I want to tell you that it has all written
to just make you happy. Even if you take a weight of dog
on the machine, the ticket will come with its weight and
with a statement that 'you are very noble.' What is noble in
dog! You check the weight of the stone; a ticket will come
for it also with a writing that 'you are very patient.' What
patience is there in a stone?
A woman told about a Baba, those who visiting him are
blessed with progeny. What's happening is, he sets out his
agents who spread the news and gathers crowd. They will
tell the child which is there on the lap is due to the blessing
of Baba. There is a Hunter wala Baba, people used to visit
him in expectation of getting cure from the disease,he used
to beat the people with hunter and make them miserable,
then also people bear him, they were not going to
doctors.Some are says to bath in particular well, you will
be benefited. People used to come from far of places. At
some place, people claim that the idol sweats and some
claims to assume their Guru in the Full Moon; all these
things are wicked games and cheating.
There was a Shivling, it was kept rising. People started
offerings lacks of rupees. A CID has identified the cause.
There was a pit under the linga, they used keep dry Bengal
grams in the night and in the morning when the gram
started expanding, the linga moved up. At least there, a
CID has identified but it is not easy to catch people in such
places. They have connection with investigation officers
also.People themselves have driven into this blind faith.
The reason is that these people are ignorant of true
devotion (Satya Bhakti). Taking advantage of their
weakness, the hypocrites entangle them more and more.
Some return after completion of penance from some
unknown place and some from some other place. Then


130 Sahib Bandgi
they start the business of collection. After doing such
penance,he should become a giver. Instead, he becomes a
beggar. What a paradox? Politicians are also in search of
such persons, because after fooling the people in their own
interest,that person can use those people as a vote bank for
politicians.This only is happening every where.
There was news from a place that a girl was observing
fasting for bringing the rain. After some days when it
rained, then people shout 'Jai Jaikar' for the girl. Then there
is news about some idol drinking Milk then all starts.
Nobody try to investigate. Similarly, on a tree sometimes
the impression of Ganeshji was seen and sometimes that of
Hanumanji. Then what to say, people line up from morning
to evening. You find offerings of lakhs of rupees.
Sometimes you see shape of some figures in the cloud but
you cannot offer anything there. Somebody gets a dream,
that there is a statue near by a temple inside the earth, it is
taken out, and people start flocking such place. What is the
matter with all these? Sants warned about these practices.
Sants had to caution the society. They will not be
worried about opposition. I am seeing lot of good theories
who talks about inner travel but the problem with them is,
they are doing such things, which they are not supposed to
do. They are immersed in Tantras and evil spirit etc and
they claim to be part of Sant Maat. No, this is not correct.
The Gurus are supposed to instruct the disciple to stay
away from ill effects.
_Khelna Ho Toh Kheliye, Pakka Hokar Khel|
Kachhi Sarso Pair Kar, Khadi Bhaya Na Tel||_
Fooling people, they take their money. Some in the
name of miracles and some in the name of Donations. It
becomes compulsory for Mahatma, He works hard to save
the disciple from such elements. This is what we tell; do
not perform any miracles. Do not take subscriptions; they
are cheating. This network is not ordinary; it is very strong.
This is not active from now, it is there since ages. These


The Real Disciple 131
networks, created problems for Mahapurushas and oppose
them.
You have to be alert. Police is for protection, it is must
strong to fulfill its duty. Why did government create
prisons? Does it want to keep the people of city inside the
jail? They are providing facilities for people like hospitals.
Then why prison? That is also for security. Those who
trouble the society and create danger, for such persons,
prison is built. In the same way, Sants alert the society,
make them understand and sometimes scolded them. The
network of hypocrites will try to weaken your faith. If you
involve in Miracles and Tantras, your devotion will be
effected. Faith will diminish. If you accept demons, it
means you do not have faith in your Gurus power. It will
afflict your Bhakti.
Today Bhakti is not evident. A girl took Naamdan, her
in laws were with another Panth. For almost ten years she
did not have a child. They started troubling her. They have
taken her to more than 50 places. Her aunt was Naami, she
advised her and brought her to me. She is from a place
nearby Arnia. She took Naamdan from me at that time.
Then after two years, she gave birth to a boy. Now the
mother in law said that they have to perform tonsure for the
boy and they have to sacrifice a goat. I have prayed that if
it is a male child, I will sacrifice the goat. She had gone to
almost 50 Tantriks and astrologers from over ten years. All
these years, nothing has happened,but now after the
Naamdan, when she gave birth to a child, this is the
condition. The girl told her mother-in-law, you have
offered so many things all these years nothing happened,
now it is due to the grace of Sahibji, the child is born. I am
asking is it Sant Matt? To give birth to a child you have to
commit a murder. Does followers of Sant Matt should be
like that?, but this old woman is from different Matt. It is a
useless Matt. Our person does not do this. We caution them


132 Sahib Bandgi
to keepaway from these practices. How much society is
misguided?
There is a old driver in Ranjadi, he got her daughter
married. The girl was very active and strong willed. After
the marriage she did not had any children for some time.
Some women who have some deficiencies cannot give
birth to a child. Some can give birth after four years. The
mother-in-law started creating problem for her. She comes
to me and said that her in-laws started criticizing her, they
all trouble her, they tell that she does not believe in Tantras
and Mantras, she has given up worshipping deities also,
how can she give birth? The girl told me that she has
complete faith in me, I do not want anything but bless me
with a child even if it is a female child, atleast I will keep
their mouth shut, all are troubling me, I am facing all of
them.
If Bhakti is done for personal ambition, it will not be
correct. This is the wrong form of Bhakti, but the issue of
the girl touched my heart. Later when she gave birth to a
boy, people were quietened. Is it a measure of devotion?.
No. devotion is not for these. Bhakti is for the welfare of
Atma but that team is troublesome, they want that an
individual will not become strong. I say, you should escape
from negativity. But by wearing threads or talisman that
team creats confusion, even prominent people are also
affected with this. One day I saw Mahatma in a Satsang,
when he rised his hand, I noticed rings on his finger. For
his own protection, he seek the help of Astrologers so how
much power he himself has. I do not wear any such articles
on our body.
I caution you at every moment. I am not asking you to
do lot of service or money in lieu of salvation. People are
teaching the art of living for 500 rupees. What is this,
world should understand. I am asking whether in the
protection of such Mahatmas, can we expect welfare of our
Soul? Therefore,world how should we understand such


The Real Disciple 133
Mahatmas and escape from them. Some pass on their seat
of a Matt for hundreds of years to their own family
members and they claim that they have crores of disciples.
My speech pinch them. They are asking people not to come
to me. They talk bad about me but I do not care, I am free
from tension.My great grandfather Guru was in chitrakutt,
he was a Brahmin. He gave his seat to Swaroopanand, he
was a kshatriya by caste. He did not give his seat to his
own caste. Then, he gave the seat to my Guru
Giridharanandji, he was a Brahmin by caste and he gave
the seat to me. He had three children, but he did not give
them. The Mahatmas in Kaliyuga are worried about their
children, they don’t bother for society. Is it that he could
not find anyone suitable among the crores of disciple he
had? Why did he give the seat to his children or relative?
They have burned my 11 Ashrams. See,what a dangerous
team!I know very well who has burned. They have also
stolen the cooking vessels, deck etc. from the
ashram,nothing is left. We are in the 21st Century. They
have burned the Ashram. This is not an ordinary incident.
People thought that we are weak and disturbed but this is
their mistake. We are not weak but we are very polite.
You can be devoted to anybody, accept anyone.
However if you are worshipping Ram, you should not
offend Rahim. Auranzeb has done such acts that even
today the people are not willing to forgive him but here
there are some who are more dangerous than him.
Our Naamis were fed non-vegetarian food forcefully,
they forcefully dipped their head in water tank till they
agreed to not to go to Sahib Bandgi. They took them to the
temple beating on the way; they forced them to bow their
head and offer salutations in the temple and pray that you
will never go to Sahib Bandgi again. How is this? Is it not
the methodology of Auranzeb?
In the state of Madhyapradesh, a woman was disrobbed
and beaten saying that she is a witch. Will the world accept


134 Sahib Bandgi
this? She was almost in the verge of death, news media
helped to save her. Even today, we are living in such a
situation. Why is it so? World has fallen due to negative
affect of religious practices. I am saying, if you wanted to
take a path of devotion, first you should overcome the
negative influences of religion, other things can be seen
later on. Until the time child learn the alphabets,
pronounciation will not be taught. Till the time you are
stuck in the negative practices, devotion is not possible.
_Khelna Ho Toh Kheliye, Pakka Hokar Khel....|_
I believe there is nobody richer than me; because I
don’t want anything from anyone.
_Vo Hi Shahanshah Hai, Jisko Nahi Chah||_
I am sure, there is nobody more energetic than me. Day
and night, I am engaged in service. Understand one thing;
an unscrupulous person cannot do service. Selfless service
cannot be done by unscrupulous. We are service oriented,
how can we be called dishonest. Then why is this
opposition? I have nothing to do with praise or blame but
the society has to think over it. Escape from the hypocrites
and negetaive religious practices. They are taking you
towards the hell.
Then what is Bhakti? If these all are not Bhakti then
this is what we are doing! What is the Bhakti which is
different from these? We are not against any form of
Bhakti. Some are saying that we are opposed to Sanatan
Dharma. It is not true, we are the real Sanatani. Sanatan
means that which is there from the time of immemorial.
We are practicing that only. We do not take non-
vegetarian food. Hindu religion forbids non-vegetarian
food. Scriptures called non-vegetarian food as food of
demons. We do not speak lies, we do not take alcohol, we
are abstaining from sinful deeds, and we do not cheat. Why
do you people do all these? Enquire about it. To follow
Sanatani is to be welcomed but if you look at the activities
of the people, they are unrightous but we follow


The Real Disciple 135
rightousness. We say there is no scope for sin and you are
all engaged in sinful deeds. It is a regretable state of affair.
We are called non-believers. Finally one should understand
Bhakti, is it not! People are engaged in looting and other
forbidden acts, also they do Tantrik worship. This is a
Tamasik art; it is also called Tamasik Bhakti. Sanatana
Bhakti is like Vaishnav Bhakti.
If we look around us, one thing is evident, all are
engaged in wrongful devotions. Some towards tree, some
towards river and some towards stone they perform Bhakti.
Why are they engaged in such Bhaktis? It is not the
mistake of people. People are directed to take such path.
Some did it out of their selfishness.
This Atma is a part of Parampurush. However, all are
engaged in worshipping Kalpurush. _'Jo Rakshak Taha
Chinhat Nahi, Jo Bhakshak Taha Dhyaan Lagaai|.'_
If someone buried an idol on some mountain then after
some time digging it out and claims that it is of Treta
Yuga, people start to flock such place. They will say that if
you bow your head there, all your work will be
accomplished. Similarly, people convert some burial
ground and claim that it is the Samadhi of so and so. Near
by they would make a pond,they will claim that those who
take dip in the pond, their problem of icthing will
disappear,diseases will be vanished. As it is, most of the
people suffer from diseases, you will find many of them
reaching that spot. However, the water will be so dirty that
even a healthy man will catch some diesease but the world
does not take the truth; they take two dips, offer money on
the Samadhi and return home. Nobody does any enquiry.
Nobody tries to understand their game plan. This is for
their selfishness, they have misguided the people towards
wrong Bhakti. In this way, hypocrites collect money. All
are entangled in these by the act of hypocrites. _'Khare
Sayane Sabhi Bhatkey, Teen Lok Mey Sabhi Atkey_ .'
Propoganda for such things are well co-ordinated. People


136 Sahib Bandgi
are so simple that they gets cheated. Some wicked people
in the village, they collect money from houses in the name
of celebrating some festival. Forcefully they collect 50- 100
rupees per person. Some poor householders have to borrow
money to pay. The reasons sound very nice...Pooja for
Devta...and Bhandara. What a devotion! What they
claim?...they claim that if you sacrifice animal and offer
money to this deity all your wishes will be fulfilled. Sahib
repeatedly tells- _'Yeh Kewal Bhram Ki Utpati._ ' their
intention is to entangle people.
The way I reveal the working of hypocrites, no one
does. Every day cheating and deception goes on increasing.
Some as Tantrik, as Astrologers, as Sayana then some as
Priest they are looting the people. ....I have no conflict with
any Devi Devta, caste or creed. My aim is to warn the
people against hypocrites and tell them that the Supreme
lord is within you, not somewhere outside.
Even the educated people are delusioned. If an anthill
comes in the house the Sayana says that such and such
Baba has come into your house. They tell the householders
that they will make it all right. Then he makes the entire
family to dance to the tune of drums.
Some time back, they were drumming in Ranjdi, a
woman stood up and started dancing. I have understood
that she is habituated in dancing to the drumbeat of
Sayanas. ...A boy was getting chauki(attack of devil spirit
in which the person started doing abnormal physical
activities). When he took the Naamdan it stopped appering.
One day he said he felt like doing it again. I warned him
“No! he should never do that......do exercise and be free
from it”. Sayanas trap not only uneducated, but educated
people also. An anthill came up in the house of an
Engineer. He invited me to his house one day and he
showed me all the rooms of his house then he took me to
that room where the Anthill was there. There was a pile of
cloth in that room. I thought there might be some


The Real Disciple 137
valuables. I told him to remove that cloth. Just when he
removed the cloth,I remembered my time in army. In the
battlefield, they make heaps of mud. I observed a similar
formation in that room. I asked him what is it. He said that
it is the grave of his grand father. I told him that it is an
Anthill. He said it is a grave and if it breaks, it becomes
still bigger.
White ants are destructive. If you break its house, it
rebuilds quickly but the Sayanas were befooling them and
made money by beating drums at that spot. I thought if I
tell him to remove this, he would not understand because
they created dillussion. Therefore, I told him to remove
that on Thursday evening between 5-6pm after reciting
Naam of Sahib.
....In this way, hypocrites have destroyed all Matts,
even the large Matts. People of those Matts are engaged in
such works. They are in confusion.They even told me to
allow our Naamis to give donations and perform animal
sacrifices and said that if I accept this condition, they will
not oppose our Matt.
...Sahib and the Sants told us to keep away from them.
They have destroyed big Panths.They even do animal
sacrifices and murders. They take an innocent lamb for
sacrifice, will not its mother cry! All parents love their
children. That is why I say," Do not do such work".
There was a Sayana who indulged people in the prayer
of Demons and Evil spirits, he had 6 sons. One of his sons
was impressed and took Naam from me. Now, he told his
father that he won't be able to stay in the house anymore.
He said that he does not feel good because all the ilgotten
money are coming home. Son told his father that he is
earning the money by fooling the people and with that
money, he is running the house. His father told him, "Son,
what Sahibji says is correct but what can I do, I have no
means of earning. With this money, I brought up all of you.


138 Sahib Bandgi
I know that what I am doing is wrong, what else I can do?
I also would like to take Namdiksha from Sahib".
One day, that boy came to me and prayed, "Oh Satguru!
With your grace, if I could find a job, I will support my
family and relieve my Father from such work. This is a
very dirty work.
...Alas! The world does not understand that how much
dirty work it is. They make the Mothers, sisters, daughters
dance to the beat of drum, and peoples are also ready for
this.All are stuck in illusion.
Atma is under bondage. If somebody thinks that they
can cross sansaar by earning merits, yoga, knowledge,
strength or attitudes, it is impossible. They cannot realise
the ultimate truth. With just Dhyan (meditation) and gyaan
(knowledge), nobody can attain the ultimate truth. They
cannot obtain freedom from the clutches of Maya because
Atma is entangled into wider network. Powerful and
cunning forces are against it. Bhakti has tremendous power
but in the name of Bhakti man has been kept under lot of
dilusion.In the name of Bhakti, many deceptive and
fraudalnt activities are done. There are groups of people
who are interested in keeping the people confused, they
dont want people to follow true path of devotion (Satya
bhakti). They indulge people in worshipping Demons and
Evil spirits, Magic and Miracles, path of action and other
forms of devotion. What do they expect finally? They
expect the society to remain in delusion and they should
not know the right direction. It is a very dangerous circle.
The Sants came to warn the society against these
people. The Bhakti, which we observe around us, is
nothing but a trap. Their aim is to amass money. Therefore,
society is facing negativity. People became entangled with
all these. Just two circumambulations and recitations of
four Mantras will not yield any benifits.
_Bina Janey Jo Nar Bhakti Karayi|
So Nahi Bhavsagar Sey Tarayi||_


The Real Disciple 139
This group is very powerful, they have not allowed any
Panth to function properly, and all are trapped. How are
they trapped! If you notice, some Panthis are involved in
animal sacrifices, doing dirty works and practice Bhakti.
You may also be witnessing this problems. You have
confidence that your Bhakti is good. You are not in
dilusion but that group of hypocrites will be after you and
if you dont listen to them, they will criticize you saying
that you have changed your religion and given up Bhakti.
They want to forcefully involve you in their ways that is
why they are complaining but you do not get despair. In
the marriage functions, death or birth in the family, they
cause lot of nuisance. Some how, they wanted to take you
to the path of action (Karma kaand). That is why I
repeatedly warn you to keep away from these people.
If the child takes birth in the House, they will show the
defects in the birth chart (Horoscope) and they will tell you
to sacrifice an animal to the Devi and so on and so forth.
They will give you an estimate of money. If you dont
agree, they will influence you through your relatives. Like
that they will not give up until you conceade (agree) to
their suggestion. All these things are not relevant to Bhakti.
Not even as a distant possibility. They expect you to
perform all these and rob you through your devotion. They
do not fight with other Panthis but only with us because;
they have already entangled them and destroyed their
ideology. They understood that Sahib Bandgi people are
not straying. This is the problem, they encounter. They
expect you also to fall prey. They compel people and
engage them in Un-Atmic Bhakti.
They will create lot of hurdles in the marriage. The
groom's family will first ask for non-vegetarian food. Then
their relation will ask for animal sacrifices to a Devi, etc.
Do not think that your relations are opposed to you.
Somebody is inciting them from behind. Then the Aunt


140 Sahib Bandgi
will say that this is not done and that is not done and stay
away but do not bother. Let them act the way, they want.
_Muze hai kam Satguru sey, duniya ruthey to ruthan de|_ '
_Guru Agyaa Teh Aavai, Guru Agyaa Le Jaai|
Kahey Kabir So Sant Jan, Bahu Vidhi Amrut Paai||_
Those who stay on the direction of Satguru, he comes
and goes as per the instructions of Satguru, Sahib says, "He
rises to the level of Sant and with splendour he drinks the
nectar". On the other side, those who do not accept words
of the Satguru, and persue only their mind, their worldly as
well as adhyatmic knowledge will not improve and
Kalpurush circles around his head.
_Guru Agyaa Maney Nahi, Chaley Atpati Chaal|
Lok Ved Dono Gaye, Aaye Sir Par Kaal||_
...At the time of marrige, they will cause so many
hinderances and they will call you repeatedly and collect
money from you. Further, they will trouble at the time of
death in the house. Birth, Marrige, Death, Festivals and
Thithis (Auspicious times), these are the occasion on which
they will trouble you and they are very active. At the time
of death, they will say, the priest was not present, Ganga
water was not used, and the rituals were not performed---.
Then they will ask for a bed,cloth etc.which was used by
deceased.
...This way, the group will create problems.
Intentionally, they will engage you in such activities. Here,
your relation is not to be blamed. They are blindfolded.
They squeeze all others out. All are carrying a Guru's
stamp on them. They are performing chauki and animal
sacrifices but our naamis do not do all these. You may
think that they are angry with you. No, they are jealous of
you. They are jealous of our banner, arrangement, looking
at your simplicity (ruhaniyat). If someone hates a person,
he will not accept any of his words but these people are
imitating us. Slowly, they are also calling Sahib-Sahib.
Will you accept, they are even copying our lettering style
(logo) of “SATYA”, take Sahibji's words also and write


The Real Disciple 141
"Satguru veh Namah:" One day, by surprise, they also may
write Sahib Bandgi. Remember, they will try to become
me. Then they will put on white Kurta-Paijama like me and
claim that they are real Sahib because they have neither a
base nor a clear goal. If anything is there, it is to collect
money fraudlently.
Neither there is goodness in the devotees nor in the
Gurus. If the person is devoted to someone and if his son
falls sick, he will say propitiate such and such a deity and
perform puja for Saturn- shani. The devotee also leaves his
chosen deity and start worshipping shani. If the cow
stopped giving milk, they will suggest worshipping some
other deity; devotee to change their deity and start
worshipping the new one.
It is a matter of regret that those who are not even
devotee blaming us. Commonly, people pursue this kind of
Bhakti. The other one is Nirgun Bhakti. Here there is
condition-No worship of idols. Those who became Yogis,
they condemned worshipping of idols. Five names are the
basis of Nirgun Bhakti.
In Akhnoor, a Nirgun bhakt organised a camp. The one
Mr. Jambhal asked him,"You are a Nirgun bhakt then why
do you do this?" he told,"All are one and same". It means
that he is not observing his rule. Those Nirgun bhakti
people consider it as a hypocrate but they also do not
follow their rules. They do everything. The world has seen
both the types of Bhaktis. We have said that these are not
Bhaktis. Non-veg food and alcohol should not be taken,
Don’t believe of evil spirits and demon spirits,so rest of
people says that we are not associating them. They are
opposed to us, still they keep coming because they are
begining to realise.
People have seen this bhakti. Our people are resolute in
following the rules. Actually society has seen vikrut form
of Bhakti, they consider it as real Bhakti. Some of our
people did mistake. A Naami's nephew was getting


142 Sahib Bandgi
married. Naami was a little stubborn. He was not visiting
anybody's home. The entire family was getting irritated.
Therefore, the nephew came and called him, "Let us go for
the marriage". He told that he doesn't want to go. He
brought another 5-6 relatives to persuade him. The naami
said: _Mansahaari Manva Pratyaksh Rakshas Jaan|
Unki Sangat Na Karo, Hoi Bhakti Mey Haani||_
He said that he did not want to go to the marriage but
they replied that there are some Naamis attending the
marriage. He said"They are not following Guru's words".
In my opinion, "What is the point in being excited so
much?" He has opposed strongly. He was speaking about
our ideology but in a distorted manner. Sometimes, we
may have to visit our relations. I did not reach my
nephew's marriage but if I happened to be there,I visit
them.
On such occasions, when we have to behave like other
people, it affects us. However, we can not bring angels
from the sky (meaning is, we have to live with worldly
people only). If we bring hatred towards worldly people
then the work (expansion of Satya Bhakti) will be spoiled.
...So the Bhakti we witness, today it is Vishnu's,
tommorow Devi and day after tommorow Kali. They bow
their head everywhere. If you ask, they will say that they
are great Devotee (Bhakt). The base of Devotion is faith.
What is Bhakti? Bhakti has two supports – "Dhyaan and
Faith". If a disciple has gone to a Tantrik, then the devotion
ends. Your Atmic powers will be hindered. Troubles used
to come in life. In such situation sayanas delude people.
The faith should come from inside and manifest externally
in action. If you have complete faith, then only it is
possible. This faith will be unshakable even in times of
problems in life. This faith should be from heart. If don’t
have faith, it means you are not in devotion. Even in the
dreams, the faith will remain. It becomes your hard-core
attainment. If you are confused, it will remain only upto


The Real Disciple 143
your brain. Let it enters in to the heart, then only you will
cross the Sansaar. This faith will consolidate in Satsang.
That is why, I do so many satsangs.
_Bin Satsang Vivek Na Hoi||_
The other one is Dhyaan- you should always
concentrate towards Sahib,that is why, external Bhakti is
strictly prohibited.
_Jagat Bhagat Mey Vair Hai, Charo Yug Parmaan||
Charo Yug Parman, Vair Yun Moos Bilaai|
Nevar Bhuangam Vair Kamval Him Kar Adhikaai||
Hasti Kehari Bair Bair Hai Dudh Khataai|
Bhais Ghod Sey Bair Chor Paharu Sey Bhai||_
There is an eminity between the devotees of the lord
and the devotees of the world. Just like the enimity
between a cat and a mouse. They cannot live together.
They had the enimity just like the bull and the horse,
elephant and lion have enimity, just as the enimity between
snake and the mongoose, enimity between theif and guard.
Theives have spoiled the sleep of security guards.
_Paap Punya Mey Vair, Agni Aur Pani||
Santan Yahi Vichaar, Jagat Ki Baat Na Mani||_
Sin is opposite of merit, there is enimity between water
and fire. Similarly, there is an enimity between Sants and
worldly people. They have no control over their Mind, that
is why they keep doing all kind of things. Thinking about
this, Sants does not accept the words of the worldly people.
Devotion is very subtle.
_Jagat Ki Najar Mey Bhagat Gaya|

You have a precious thing with you. You will not have
fear of death even. You might have experienced that power
protects you in times of danger. Do not be concerned about
any opposition to you. Do not involve with them. Be
careful. They are the ways of the world so remain strong.
...So the society has taken this as Bhakti. It is difficult to
comprehend the basis of principles. Only the one with the
true wisdom can impart this knowledge. In the


144 Sahib Bandgi
Yogavashista, Vashista muni made Ramchandra to
concentrate only on Atma, gave only that instruction.
Let us see at the end, whether one can experience Atma
or not. How is the atma? Let us conemplate.
_Kya Hua Vedo Key Padhney Se Na Paya Bhed Ko|
Atma Jane Bina Toh Gyaani Kehlata Nahi||_
Till one realise the atma-tatva, he cannot be a man of
wisdom (gyani). How to identify an Atma-Gyaani? We
will move towards Atma-Tatva later. When we look at the
Mahatmas, we are unable to identify whether they are
Atma gyaani or not. People are entangled due to ignorance
hence, they end up in confusion. How is it happen?
A man had a daughter. He was worried. With the grace
of Sahibji, he got a son. I told that a woman occupied the
highest seat for 16years. Even in the neighbouring country,
Shrilanka, Bangladesh and Pakisthan, Women ruled it.
Then where is the problem with the girl child? Anyway, he
was worried, atlast with Sahib's grace he got a boy. The
boy was about 4-5years old. Everybody tease him and tell
him that you are a girl. I also asked him, "Are you a boy or
girl"? He told me that he is a boy. I asked him,"Are you not
a girl? How can you say that you are a boy?" he told me
that his father has told me that he is a boy. It means, he has
not understood the basics, the identification. He had only
acceptance. A girl was standing there. I asked, "Who is
this?" he said, "she is a girl". I asked him, "Why?" he said,
"She is a girl". Somebody might have told him that she is a
girl. He might have understood, the one with the long hair
has girl. I asked him,"Prove that you are a boy". He
became anxious. He had no explaination. He was a boy but
he has not understood how he is a boy. He told, "I have
accepted myself as boy".
A girl was sitting. She was wearing a pant shirt. She
looked like a boy in appearance. I also thought that it was a
boy seated with his mother. I asked the child to move to the
men side. Then the child told her name and said that she is


The Real Disciple 145
a girl. I had told her that your mental expressions are that
of a girl then why are you dressed up like a boy. She said
that she wanted to become a boy. My brother is allowed to
move around free but I am restrained. So therefore, I
wanted to become a boy. Even with the disguise, she was
still a girl. In the same way, Atma has taken up the body
but in essence, it is only Atma.
At times, Atma knows its own condition. It is not that
after experiencing the pleasures of the world, it is satisfied.
No way. Why is that such an intelligent man cannot
realise?
External expression of devotion is also the same. The
story telling goes on. We are not against this. Then there is
singing and dancing. What is all these? It means, now a
days, the form of devotion has become crooked. Sahibji
says:
_Kaal Ka Jeev Maney Nahin,Main Kotin Kahoon Samujhaye.
Main Kheenchat Hoon Satlok Ko,Yeh Bandha Yampur Jaye._
Inspite of my tireless attempts, the jivas in the universe
of Kaal doesn’t try to understand the reality. I try to take
them to Satlok but they prefer to go to Yampuri in chains.

#### 4. How Is Your Daily Routine?

If you aspire for the grace of Satguru, sanctify your
daily routine.
1.Wake up before Sunrise, remembering Satguru offer
Sahib Bandgi and identify which side of the nose is active
(Ida-left and Pingala-right), look at the palm of hand on
that side and rub over your face with that palm gently.

2. After ablutions and bathing, take a seat in a solitary
   place, meditate on Satguru as demonstrated during
   Naamdan and receive the powerful rays.
3. Perform Arti of Satguru in the morning (preferably
   with all the family members together).
4. If Guru is nearby go for his Darshan with that you
   can receive Adyatmic rays directly.
5. If there is a Satsang of Satguru nearby, attend. Listen
   to his nectarine words and receive the Adyathmic rays.
6. In the evening, perform Arti for Satguru.
7. If there is an opportunity, take Darshan of Satguru
   again in the evening.
   8.Without any expectation, offer your services to
   Satguru with Tan, Man, Dhan (Body, Mind and Wealth).
   9.You should spend 10 percent of your earning in the
   service of Satguru (as per scriptures) but I have not laid
   down this condition because if you cannot offer to spend, it
   will amount to non-compliance with the words of Guru.
   That is why, I did not bind you. I left it to your discretion.
10. At times, on occasions, keep Arti at home; invite
    others and of fer them food.

#### 5. Make A Daily Routine

Get up early in the morning at Brahmamuhurt (3-6am)
and meditate on Satguru.
_Nind Nishani Maut Ki, Uth Kabira Jag||_
A disciple of Satguru should not get up late in the
morning. You should get up in the Brahmamuhurt and do
Naam Bhajan (Reversing of breath with ‘Naam’). Most
people do get up in the morning and do Naam Bhajan.
However, a true lover, devotee should give up laziness and
get up in the night and sit in the concentration of Naam.
_Dekha Dekhi Sab Kahey, Bhor Bhaye Prabhu Naam|
Ardh Raat Koi Jan Japey, Khanajad Gulam||_
When you wake up in the morning say ‘Sahib Bandgi’
to those around you (Guru Brothers and Sisters). Stay in
the expectation of Satguru’s Darshan morning and evening.

#### 6. Mending Your Life

Reduce your needs to bear minimum. If you increase
the needs, you have to proportionally struggle harder. Keep
your concentration on devotion and Naam Bhajan. Earn
only that much which is need to maintain your life.

Ab Guru Pure Miley Prabhu Mohi, Satya Vrat Ab Kaho Videhi|

Dharmadas places a request to Sahibji and says when
my concentration was dull, I was not aware so I was
observing religious vows-austerities. Now I have got
Satguru. Therefore, kindly explain to me true Vrat-vows-
austerities, which I should concentrate (Surti) on.
Sahib says:
_Dharmadaas Tum Buzehu Mohi, Vrat Katha Kaho Mey Tohi||
Nischay Vrat Purush Ko Aahi, So Dharmani Parkho Hiy Mahi|_
Sahibji said, I will tell you about the vrat which you can
do for Parampurush.
_Vrat Prabhav Dharmani Suno, Tohi Kaho Samuzay|
Nij Yaha Vrat Amar Pad, Jo Nar Nischay Dhyay||_
Oh Dharmadaas, now I will tell you about the vrat. If
you resolve to do it sincerely, you can attain immortality.

Sahibji says that Poornima vrat is for Parampurush.
Parampurush has given it to me. With this vrat, all sins will
be destroyed and salvation is attained. The one who takes
to this vrat should be free from desires, anger, hatred,
pride, lust, greed, etc and stay always in the remembrance
of Saar Naam. Such a person will never again take birth in
84 lakhs of Jivas.
Dharmadaas asked sahib:

Puno Vrat Mohi Kaho Bhuzai, Jaso Kaal Daga Mit Jahi||

Dharmadaas asked with folded hands, Sahib please tell
me about Poornima vrat by doing which I can be free from
the effects of Kaalpurush.

The merit one attains in doing crores of Yagya and
making crores of pilgrimages, circumambulating all the
worlds, you will attain merit of all these in one Poornima
vrat, those who observe this sincerely from heart, his
problems, his difficulties and poverty will be destroyed.
The disciple should stay awake in the night and engage the
mind in Dhyan and Naam bhajan of Satguru. Such a
disciple will attain Amarlok. He should not take food
during daytime and he should take food only after sunset in
the night after offering to Sahibji then, you partake the
food. On the day of vrat do arti to sahibji with the lamp lit.
Giving up lies and wickedness, be in the remembrance of
Naam. If you are observing vrat and if you cannot remain,
awake, then it will be fruitless. Stay awake in the vrat and
offer food to the Sadhus in the morning. Those who
observe other types of vrat instead of Poornima vrat, they
remain entagled in this world itself. Those who are firmly
concentrate on Sat Naam, he will cross the ocean of life.
He never return to the womb of mother.

Sahibji said that I would tell you the procedure in
detail. There was a merchant who had taken Naamdan
from Satguru along with his wife. Both of them were
devoted in thought, word and deed to me. They had no
other thought. Both of them were observing, Poornima
vrat. Once, his wife was pregnant. Ninth month again the
Poornima came. She gave birth to a boy. That was the day
for Poornima vrat.
The women told her:
_Suno Sakhi Tum Vachan Humara, Yaha Toh Vrat Chhuti

Sutak Maahi Vrat Na Kijey, Kaha Humaro Maan Karijye||
Dusar Vrat Aavey Puni Joai, Ta Din Vrat Karo Tum Soi||

152 Sahib bandgi
They told her to keep away from vrat because you are
polluted-defiled due to birth of a child. They asked her to
keep the vrat the next month.
The mother of the child told:

She said may be the body is unclean but my heart is
pure. I cannot give up the support of my Satguru.
Therefore, she observed the vrat and spend the time in
remembrance of the Naam. In the evening, after sunset the
fasting came to an end. In the night, she had prepared food


The Real Disciple 153
in the kitchen with pure ghee. At the same time, two sants
had arrived at her house; looking at the sants she became
very happy. She left the child and brought them in inside
the home with reverence. She took Charanamrut and
offered them seat and then she offered food to them. Sants
took the food; after offering gave her Prasad. The lady sat
in meditation in which she had a darshan of Parampurush
after which she never heard any shortage of things. Such
devotees are rare who remains always concentrated in the
feet of Satguru. All his accumulated Sins will be destroyed.
Dharmadasji says:
_Dharmadas Buzey Kar Jori, Samarth Suniye Vinti Mori||
Tum Ho Dayavant Prabhu Swami, Ghat Ghat Ke Tum

Ek Baat Puchhan Ki Aasha, Taka Swami Karo Prakasha||
Aur Vrat Sabhi Nar Karhi, Puno Vrat Chit Eku Na Dharhi||
So Kaaran Koun Hey Swami, Tum Ab Kaho Prabhu
Antaryaami||_
Dharamadasji asked Sahib, people do all other types of
vrat but not the Poornima vrat of Satguru, what is the
reason for this?
Sahib says:
_Kahey Kabir Suno Dharmadasa, Sakal Bhed Mey Karo Prakasha||
Aur Vrat Sugam Hey Bhai, Satya Vrat Ko Naahi Tulaai||
Puno Vrat Sada Sukhdaai, Rakhey Vrat Param Pad Paai||

Yah Jo Karmakand Vyavhara, Puno Bhed Hey Untey Nyara||
Satya Vrat Purush Anusara, Dharamani Tumso Kahayo Vichara||
Puno Vrat Mul Le Rakha, Aur Vrat Sakal Hey Shakha||
Ja Din Uttpati Purush Anusara, Ta Din Puno Ko Vistara||
Soraha Ansh Pragat Jab Kinha, Vrat Upasan Puno Dinha||_


154 Sahib bandgi
Sahib says all other types of vrat are easy. There is no
comparison possible. The Poornima vrat grants all
happiness and immortality. All the other types of vrat are
concerned with action and reaction (Karmakand) but
Poornima’s vrat is supreme. This is the vrat of
Parampurush.
Further Sahib says:
_Aaho Dharmani Tum Bhali Vichari, Puchhi Katha Saban
Hitkaari||
Ab Sunu Varat Mahatam Saara, Suni Tarhi Jiv Karhi Vichara||
Aadi Puno Purush Nivasa, Surti Naam Ami Parkasa||
Tumso Kaho Sunhu Dharmadasa, Aadi Puno Karo Prakasa||
Puno Vrat Purush Mohi Dinha, Teen Ank Jori Hum Linha||
Puno Vrat Surat Se Hoi, Surati Naam Niakshar Samoi||
Puno Katha Mey Kaho Sunai, Jaaso Paap Sakal kshaya Jaai||
Nirgun Brahm Sagun Autara, Jaaso Jiv Hoy Nistara||
Puno Vrat Karey Jo Koi, Tako Aavagaman Na Hoi||
Kaam Krodh Mad Lobh Bhulavey, Ninda Irshya Durr Bahavey||
Karm Bharam Par Aasha Visarey, Satguru Charankamal Chit
Dhaarey||
Saat Shabd Mey Rahe Samai, Bahuri Na Yoni Sankat Aai||_
Sahib says Oh Dharmadas! Parampurush gave me this
vrat. This is done with Surti (concentration-dhyan). On this
day, keep the Surti on Naam. All the accumulated Sins will
come to an end. They will be free from all the bestial
nature; Kama (desire), Krodha (anger), Lobha (greed),
Moha (attachment), Mada (pride) and Maathsarya (envy).
They surrender their mind at the feet of Satguru and free
themselves from Karmas and illusions (Bhram). He is
always immersed in the sound of Satya and never returns
to the womb of a mother.
Dharmadasji says:
_Jagran Kahe Koun Ko Kahiye, Taako Bhed Sakal Suni Lahiye||_
Dharmadasji asked, Sahibji, how do we perform Jagran (Night
Vigil)?
Sahibji says:
_Surti Rahe Sahib Ke Maahi, Bhajan Karey Maan Bhatkey Naahi||
Jagran Katha Satya Hey Bhai, Bin Jagran Kahu Gati Naahi Paai||_


The Real Disciple 155
_Tatey Sakal Katha Suni Lijey, Shraddha Karke Jagran Kijey||
Ek Phir Sun Jagran Ki Tika, Vah Jagran Hovey Naahi Nika||
Saari Raat Nind Naahi Aavey, Naam Bhajan Mah Chitt Lagavey||
Ninda Karey zuth Labrai, So Jagran Nahi Kahiye Bhai||
Tatey Guru Gum Hruday Dharo, Jagran Bani Aavey So Karo||
Baal Vruddh Rogi Nar Naari, Pahar Ghadi Kshan Sang Piyari||
Shraddha Hin Rahey Nar Suta, Takah Vighna Karey Yumduta||
Jagran Karey Prem Lav Lavey, Amar Hoy Satyalok Sidhavey||
Puno Praata Snaan Karai, Sadhu Sant Mey Ruchi Upjaai||
Santan Ki Charanamrut Lehi, Tako Satguru Bahu Sukh Dehi||
Sadhu Atithi Dwaar Kou Aavey, Prem Sahit jal Ashan Karavey||
Shakti Hoy Soi Bhojan Dijey, Sant Jivay Prem Phal Lijey||
Shatt Darshan Abhyagat Koi, Dwaarey Aay Vimukh Nahi Hoi||
Aisey Puno Vrat Karu Nishanka, Sabhi Suno Raav Aaru Ranka||
Puno Katha Jo Suney Sunavey, Aap Tarey Jiv Aur Taravey||
Uchhishta Bhojan Karo Na Bhai, Parghar Bhojan Karan Na Jaai||
Guru Seva Karey Saanch Hi Boley, Puno Vrat Kabahu Na Doley||
Puno Vrat Sadahi Kijey, Maas Maas Dehi Sukh Lijey||
Aap Karey Aouran Karvavey, Puno Vrat Ko Bhed Batavey||
Puno Vrat Indri Drudh Rakhey, Hruday Naam Purush Ko
Bhakhey||
Puno Chhaadi Anya Vrat Karhi, Bina Bhed Kaisey Uddharhi||
Satya Naam Sumirey Ek Dhara, Puno Vrat Purush Ko Pyara||
Puno Vrat Karey Man Laai, Sarv Siddhi Ta Ghar Mey Aai||
Sukrut Hoy Bhakti Bahu Pavey,Garbhvaas Mey Bahuri Na Aavey||_
Sahib says that Jagran should be done in such a way
that Surti (Concentration) should be on Sahib and mind
should not waver. It should be done by total faith. The
entire night, you should not sleep and Naam bhajan should
go on continuously. Those who does Jagran with saturation
of love, will reach Amarlok. Those who does all vrat other
than Poornima vrat has not understood secret. Therefore,
they do not attain benediction. This vrat is very dear to
Parampurush. Those who observe Poornima vrat in their
home recites all Siddhis. They do not return to the womb
again.

#### 7.The glory & benefits of Poornima Vrat

_Poonam Vat Arti Karai, Takar Phal Kachu Varani Na Jahi||
Gokul Aagam Bahu Gunn Gaai, Koti Shivratri Jagran Laai||
Koti Ekadashi Ke Phal Paai, So Phal Poonam Vrat Ko Bahi||
Agam Chaudas Amavas Aai, Jain Dharm Tap Bahut Karai||

Ravi Som Mangal Guru Raai, So Phal Puno Vrat Karai||
Hakkh So Sahib Sada Hajur, Kaphar Se Toh Sahib Durr||
Kalma Nivaaj Baang Dhunn Laai, Tiso Roza Mahakashta Te Paai||
Aanna Pani Khaye Piye Nahi Bhai, So Phal Ek Poonam Vrat Karai||
Aadsath Tirth Phir Phir Aavey, Ashvamedh Yagya Ko Phal Pavey||
Koti Kanya Godaan Devaai, So Phal Poonam Ka Vrat Karai||

Deu Rattan Padarth Chara, Deu Mann Icha Teh Mangal Saara||
Surti Kariye Sumiran Karey, Janam Anek Ko Paatak Harey||
Ajaan Jiv Ki Kiye Ghata, Soi Paap Hooth Nishpata||
Ved Shastra Sabhi Yah Kahey, Poonam Saman Vrat Na Lahey||_
Sahibji says, the benefits one gets by performing Arti
on the day of Poornima, cannot be described by words.
Observing vigil and shivratri nights for 1000s of years, on
the benefit of observing 1000s years of ekadashi. This will
be equated to one Poornima vrat. 30 days observance of
roza without food and drink with difficulty, even if you
complete 68 pilgrimages, obtain benefits of Ashwamedh
yagya, given charity 1000 cow, all the fruit acquired with
all these can be achieved in one Poornima vrat. He acquires
Nav nidhi. All his desires will be fulfilled and I grant the
four Purushaartas. Vedas and Shastras say that there is
nothing, which can be compared to Poornima vrat.
_Kabir Sangat Sadhu Ki, Kabhi Na Nishfal Hoye.
Loha Paras Paaras Te, So Bhi Kanchan Hoye.
A piece of iron turns into gold on coming in contact
with paras (a stone). In the same manner, the company of a
sadhu never goes unrewarded. One is able to achieve some
or other benefit._

**The Difference Between Yog matt And Sant Matt**
Yog Matt Sant Matt
In Yog Matt there is
Naam with a definite
Body.

In Sant Mat there is
Bodiless Naam (Soundless
sound).
It moves around five
postures (techniques
of meditation)—Chachri,
Bhuchri,Agochri, Unmuni
&Khechri that are present
in our body

```
Here the concentration is
fixed at a height of about 1¼
hands above the head at 8th
chakra-Seat of Satguru.
```
Here Naam falls within
the limit of 5 elements &
is used in our daily
expression.

Here Nam doesn’t fall
within the limit of 5 elements
& is not used in our daily
expression.
Here the musical
sounds themselves are
taken as God.

```
Here Param Purush—the
real God, is far beyond these
narrow limits.
```
It is a path of earning
merits through noble
deeds.

It is an easy path in which
the grace of Satguru is
considered as Supreme. Here
the Satguru turns the disciple
like himself.
Here Surti Shabad
(musical sounds for
fixing concentration) is
practised.

```
Here awareness is being
created in our Surti.
```
Here the disciples are
blessed with Naam of Kal
Niranjan that is
associated with the body.

Here the disciples are
blessed with a living Naam
of Parampurush that is
associated with Soul.
Here a Guru has
almost no role to play,
only your effort.

```
Here the very essense of
worship is the Sant Satguru
for his grace.
It has definite limits. It is limitless. It takes you
```

164 Sahib bandgi
Here the devotee can
reach upto the 10th
aperture-Sahastrasaar
only.

```
through the 11th aperture
that lies within our Surti
(concentration).
```
Yog Mat considers the
formless Niranjan as the
Supreme Lord.

In Sant Mat, Parampurush
is the Supreme lord and
attainment of the 4th loka
(Amarlok) that lies far
beyond the limit of 3 lokas of
Niranjan.
Here the jiva has to
return again to the
material world after
exhausting the fruit of
noble deeds.

```
Here the jiva attains
permanent salvation & will
never return back to this
mortal world.
```
It does not function
independently& depends
on the teachings of
religious scriptures.

```
Here the Satguru speaks
out of his inner experiences.
```
Here the jiva attains
with efforts miraculous
powers but not the
spiritual wisdom.

```
Here the jiva can attains
spiritual powers and true
spiritual wisdom by the grace
of Satguru.
```
It is the path of Meen
& Papeel.(moving like a
fish or an ant)

It is the path of
Vihangam. (flying to
Amarlok like a Bird-
extraordinary speed).
There are five steps in
Yog Matt & all of these
are under the control of
Kal Purush.

```
Sant Matt is related to the
direct worship of the
Satguru. Satya Bhakti.
```

The Real Disciple 165
**Some Quries Answered By Satguru Sahib Ji**

1. Some question that didn't Parampurush knew that
   Niranjan would hurt the beings. Then why did he grant him
   souls?
   My reply is that the souls has been provided in
   Complete protection that Niranjan would not be able to
   hurt them.
2. Some say that isn't giving a curse to swallow one
   lakh beings is a punishment for the soul?
   No, this is only a punishment for mind. Soul is not hurt
   in any way. It is safe.
3. Some say that can't Parampurush set souls free?
   It could be done in a moment but then it will nullify
   boon give to Niranjan, the reign of 17 chaukdi infinite
   yugs.
   4.Some ask that, what was the fault of the soul?
   That's why you will get a chance to go to that country.
   5.Which beings wanders lost?
   Whoever will get naam daan from me will eventually
   take the right path. However, your main aim shell be no
   rebirth. If you are not on right track then you will get
   signals. When you are being protected then why wander?
   A mother gives proper care to her child, feeding him,
   bathing him, feeding milk and also provide protection,
   even then she may commit a mistake but this protective
   power accompanying you would never commit a
   Mistake.You can realise the changes yourself. If you
   commit a mistake and sahib abandons you then know that
   Niranjan has won. Sahib won't leave you ,he will leave you
   only after improvising you. He will not tell you to go die.
   You will commit less mistakes as long as you are in the
   shadow of Niranjan.
6. Some query whether we won't he harmed by those
   we were worshipping before?
   When someone queried this, I replied in negative. A
   goat got lost in a forest. There are many hunters out there.


166 Sahib bandgi
She straight went to lion and asked for his protection which
was promised to her by the lion. He them made an
announcement in the forest as not to hurt the goat. After
that the goat wandered the forest in safety. So this is the
same fundamentals. Nobody ever mentioned that I used to
worship Hanuman ji and now he is hurting me. We are not
against the shashtras. So have faith. We are saying-
_Devi Deval Jagat Mein,Kotik Pooje Koye.
Satguru Ki Pooja Kiye,Sabki Pooja Koye._
Some people say that you are worshipping a human
rather than dieties. Firstly,watch where shashtras are
pointing. We are not decrying anyone. We are just saying
that these are the messengers of the niranjan. Vedas
mention-
_Dhyan Moolam Guru Roopam, Pooja Moolam Guru Padkam.
Mantra Moolam Guru Vakyam, Moksh Moolam Guru Kripa._

7. Someone asked that the naam given given by you
   cannot be written, it is a subject of soundless sound but it
   can be spoken by us.
   I replied that you have misunderstood. It is just like the
   flow of electricity through the wire. This has the similar
   mechanism.
   8.Some people say that a women's guru is her husband.
   Then why does she need to have a guru?
   I asked her husband, where he had read this? Where is
   it mentioned that a women's husband is her Guru. He was
   just echoing same thing again and again.I understood that I
   am facing a perverse.I asked him-have you heard of Lord
   Shiva? He replied-yes. Do you know his wife's name?He
   replied-Parvati.I further asked who is Guru of Parvati? He
   replied in negative. I told him that parvati's guru is Narad
   ji. If the wife of lord shiva had to have a guru then what is
   a mere human thinking. I then asked him-have you heard
   of Ram ji?He said-yes. What is the name of his wife? He
   replied-Sita ji. When I enquired about sita's guru he didn't
   had any answer. then I told him that it was Vashisht muni.


The Real Disciple 167
Ram ji never said to her that I am your guru. In the end, the
person is again saying that a women has no guru.
